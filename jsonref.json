Chinese firms are using England\u0027s captain Harry Kane\u0027s (right) name, \u0027Ha Li Kai En\u0027 (哈里凯恩), to sell various garments, including babywear (file photo, left), swimming suits and skirtsSome of the applications were submitted by the football stars themselves though.Messi filed seven trademark applications in China in 2007 for a wide range of merchandise, including deodorant, toothpaste, postcards, alarm clocks and board games.On the other hand, Cristiano Ronaldo has 15 \u0027C Luo\u0027 applications made by himself in China to cover some rather unconventional businesses, including computer software, gemstones, Christmas decorations and even nursing homes.   MailOnline has reached out to the representatives of the footballers for comments.  Brazilian Neymar\u0027s (left) name \u0027Nei Ma Er\u0027 (内马尔) is used to sell tyres while Uruguayan Suárez (right), or \u0027Su Ya Lei Si\u0027 (苏亚雷斯), probably doesn\u0027t know there are \u0027Suárez\u0027 pots and pansFootball is one of the biggest sports in China, and successful football players are well loved by people of all age groups - from children to pensioners. But Chinese companies have a history of using the images and names of international  stars without  their knowledge or consent.The two most famous cases involved David Beckham and Brazilian footballer Ronaldo. In 2009, a company used a video clip of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - to sell its Viagra-style, erectile dysfunction drugs in a TV advert, which was aired in prime time across the country.In the advert,  the image of Beckham was given a male voice-over, which gushed \u0027this is my secret weapon to satisfy Victoria\u0027.Beckham had not agreed for his likeness to be used and was said to be furious about the advert, according to a previous report.The drug was made by Beijing-based Sheng Shi Wei Tu International Biotechnology.A sales manager from the company told Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post that the advert had been approved by the Chinese authorities.          Brazilian footballer Ronaldo is shown apparently holding a box of Golden Throat sweets in an advertisement in 2003. The famous player hadn\u0027t agreed to the usage and sued the company          The image of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - was used by a Chinese company to sell its erectile dysfunction drugs in a nation-wide infomercial in 2009In 2003, Brazilian footballer Ronaldo\u0027s image was used by  a pharmaceutical company, Golden Throat, without his consent.In the TV and printed advertisements, Ronaldo was seen smiling while holding a box of the company\u0027s throat-soothing sweets.The TV advert was aired extensively on national networks, including Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, for as long as three years.China Daily reported  that Ronaldo complained about the \u0027illegal\u0027 usage in 2007 and even hired lawyers to prepare for a lawsuit against Golden Throat.The report claimed that Ronaldo had missed seven contracts with an estimated total worth of €22.4million (£19.8million) a year because of the Golden Throat advertisements. However, the lawsuit didn\u0027t proceed due to unexplained reasons, reported Chinese financial news site yicai.com. Golden Throat subsequently replaced Ronaldo\u0027s image with that of Kaká, another Brazilian football player. Kaká was officially contracted by Golden Throat and was paid 14.3million yuan (£1.62million) for three years for the advertisements, according to yicai.com.           Chinese diary company Mengniu has allegedly paid £4.5 million for Messi to be its ambassador          Wahaha, a large beverage company, is the sponsor of Portugal national football team in ChinaChinese people\u0027s passion towards football stars is simply unbelievable. Any products with a football star\u0027s name or likeness associated to them would sell like hot cakes.On the other hand, Chinese copyright law and image rights are notoriously complicated, a factor that the advert makers may have considered would protect them from a lawsuit.While small Chinese firms compete to be the first to register football stars\u0027 Chinese names as trademarks, more and more high-profile Chinese brands  are shelling out to sign international football stars to represent their products.Mengniu, China\u0027s second-largest dairy company and an official sponsor of World Cup 2018, has hired Lionel Messi to be its ambassador. The signing fee is said to be 40million yuan (£4.5 million).Wahaha, China\u0027s largest beverage company, inked a deal with Portugal national football team earlier this year to be their official World Cup sponsor in China.Wey, a made-in-China car brand, engaged Cristiano Ronaldo in a minute-long advertisement to be aired throughout China during World Cup. Ronaldo is also the latest ambassador of the auto label, which is a namesake of its billionaire Chinese founder Jack Wey (魏建军).          Chinese President Xi Jinping is known for his passion for football. Xi (centre) is seen kicking a Gaelic football as he visits the Croke Park in Dublin on February 19, 2012These impressive commercial contracts also came after China Super League teams had spent billions in the past few years to buy top-notch players from European clubs.Meanwhile, Chinese advertisements are ubiquitous in the Russian stadiums during this year\u0027s World Cup - even though team China is not even in the game. Perhaps Chinese president Xi Jinping\u0027s passion for football could help explain the country\u0027s craze for the game. Xi once said: \u0027I am a football fan. Chinese football has been trying very hard.\u0027The leader\u0027s three wishes are for China to qualify for the World Cup, host the World Cup and win the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s the secret weapon with which I can satisfy Victoria\u0027: David Beckham used to sell anti-impotence drugs in China... without him knowing | Daily Mail OnlineRonaldo to sue China\u0027s Guangxi Golden Throat Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/14/4E16F0B500000578-5937227-image-a-170_1531231102830.jpg","title":"The Queen joined Harry Meghan royals arrive RAF service","story":"    Left to right: Prince Charles, Prince Andrew (behind), the Duchess of Cornwall, the Queen, the Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace          Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, were allowed to watch the spectacle from a window of the palace          The Queen, dressed in blue in a nod to the RAF, applauded as the fly-past roared over Buckingham Palace          Vintage military aircraft perform a fly past over the Queen Victoria Memorial and Buckingham Palace          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who yesterday christened their son Louis, appeared in excellent spirits on the balcony          The Earl of Wessex, Countess of Wessex and the Princess Royal attend a reception at Horse Guards Parade, London, to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force          Prince William, 36, right, shared a joke with his new sister-in-law the Duchess of Sussex, left, as they stood on the balcony          Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Michael of Kent attend a reception at Horse Guards Parade, London, to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force       Look beautiful in blue like Kate in a coat dress by Alexander McQueenShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERIt\u0026#39s fair to say the Duchess of Cambridge has found a style that suits her and she\u0026#39s sticking to it.

I was the last cadet to wear it, and now she is wearing it. It is the best accesory.\u0027Although the Duchess is not a cadet they seem to think she was deserving of the brooch.

I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

Milne described this moment as: \u0027…wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place in the top of the Forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing\u0027The \u0027charming childishness\u0027 of Christopher Robin is marked by the clumsy \u0027100 AKER WOOD\u0027, as well as a compass marked with points spelling out the title character\u0027s name.Hundred Acre Wood was inspired by Ashdown Forest in East Sussex.In 1925, AA Milne bought Cotchford Farm on the edge of the forest and he soon started publishing stories about the beloved bear.Prince Harry spends £8,000 on first edition Winnie The Pooh...Share this articleThe map recently emerged for the first time in almost 50 years and was one of the highlights of Sotheby\u0027s English Literature, History, Science, Children\u0027s Books and Illustrations sale.Experts gave it an estimate of between £100,000 and £150,000 - but after worldwide attention it ended up selling for £430,000.This beat the previous record for any book illustration of £314,500, set at Sotheby\u0027s in December 2014 for the original illustration for Poohsticks.          The auction included original sketches of Christopher Robin’s most famous friends, filled with charming details like Eeyore’s Gloomy Place, aboveDr Philip W. Errington, director and senior specialist, Department of Printed Books and Manuscripts, Sotheby\u0027s said: \u0027I suspect that there isn\u0027t a single child who wouldn\u0027t instantly recognise this wonderful depiction of The Hundred Acre Wood.\u0027This is the first drawing you encounter in the book and is the visual guide to the entire world of Winnie-the-Pooh.\u0027In this group of original drawings, you can see the real skill of the artist, the skill of the strokes of his pen.          E.H. Shepard  - An ink drawing from The House at Pooh Corner. Despite being the work of Shepard, who also later illustrated Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows, the map suggests that he was merely a helping hand, as Christopher Robin’s childish script signs off \u0027Drawn by me and Mr Shepard helped\u0027\u0027They\u0027ve never been brought out in the UK or the US with illustrations by anyone else apart from EH Shepard and that is the power, and ability of the illustrator, and why this is probably the most famous map in English literature.\u0027Featuring on the opening end-papers of the original 1926 book, the sketch introduces readers to the delightful imagination of Christopher Robin and his woodland friends.Exactly 40 years later the map played a starring role in the landmark Disney film - Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Tree - where it was brought to life as an animation in the film\u0027s opening sequence. In total, the map and other illustrations sold for a combined £917,500 - three times the lower estimate. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19EFFE00000578-5938909-image-m-112_1531256425297.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan land Dublin embark overseas tour married couple","story":"Go for glamour like the Duchess of Sussex in an Emilia Wickstead dressShop the designer at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe Duchess of Sussex has been one busy lady these past 24 hours having gone from Prince Louis\u0026#39 christening, to commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force and now to Ireland with Prince Harry.As she embarks on her first overseas tour since officially joining the Royal family, all eyes will most definitely be on what Meghan is wearing.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet!

They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027                                                    His youthful side have become one of the stories of the tournament, reaching the semi-finals with a fresh and stylish philosophy that bodes well for the future.And no matter what happens tonight, Southgate insists their World Cup run is merely the beginning of what he believes will be a fruitful legacy.\u0027I\u0027ve been involved in all the plans through the age groups,\u0027 added Southgate.\u0027To have seen our younger teams have success is hugely rewarding. We know our academies are producing technically good players.\u0027We made a lot of changes with the national teams but lots of changes that helped us to be successful. We believe we have to continue doing that, constantly evolve and improve. This team, the same. The experiences of the last few weeks, the milestones they\u0027ve hit, are a great reference point moving forward.\u0027We have players in this squad who will take us forward and others coming through the age groups with belief they can win but also expectations that we should be in latter stages more regularly.\u0027Many have turned to the black market to try to get tickets for England\u0027s first semi-final in 28 years. Last night ticket touts were operating outside the Fifa ticketing centre near Dobryninskaya Metro station as England fans arrived in Moscow trying to find tickets.In desperation, some fans walked around Red Square wearing placards pleading for entry to the match.Patrick James, 26, from Welling, Kent, arrived in Moscow on Monday. Within hours he had turned to a World Cup Facebook page which saw those keen to get rid of tickets offering them to the highest bidders.He said: \u0027Basically, I went on the site and within an hour I had about 15 people – a lot of them Russians – offering category one and two tickets which cost between £200 and £330 for the semi-final for twice that amount.\u0027In the end I have agreed a £500 price with a guy I am going to meet four hours before the kick-off near the stadium.\u0027He is a Russian fan and obviously disappointed his team went out of the competition. But for me this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don\u0027t want to miss it.\u0027          The wives and girlfriends of England players have sent their love and support for the boys by posting pictures of them kissing after matches including Rebekah Vardy and Harry Maguire\u0027s partner Fern Hawkins          Elton John posted pictures of his boys in their football shirts ahead of the game tonight           Pupils, parents and teachers at Padnell Infant School in Portsmouth sent their best wishes to former student Gareth Southgate          Staff at Next\u0027s headquarters in Leicester have got into the spirit of the big game by wearing shirts and having flags on the reception desk          Nortree Motor company in Melksham, Wiltshire, have given some of their cars some very special numberplates for the day            Up to 10,000 England fans are trying to get to Russia for the biggest World Cup for a generation          England\u0027s win over Sweden in Samara on Saturday put the team one game away from the final          Boss Gareth Southgate puts his arm around star striker Harry Kane after beating Sweden and the nation will watch them with excitement and trepidation tonight  It\u0027s Red, White and Blue Square!

He said: \u0027I\u0027m hoping their (Croatia\u0027s) luck has run out. Two penalty shootouts and they weren\u0027t that good, they just scraped through. I think it\u0027s our year this time.\u0027There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station. And they\u0027re just thinking, \u0027we\u0027ll get behind these lads\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re not bothered about the money, they look like they are enjoying it, they want to do it and they\u0027re proud to do it for their country.\u0027He predicted a 2-0 England win and said he believed the celebrations would be on a larger scale than in 1966 if England go on to win the trophy.\u0027I remember watching 66 on TV as a little lad and going outside playing football afterwards until it was dark,\u0027 he said.\u0027It was very uplifting for the country but because there was no internet, not as much media, you didn\u0027t actually know what was going on.\u0027There were some newsreels and everybody was uplifted but this time, from every part to the country, you are going to see what\u0027s happening - it\u0027s going to be brilliant.\u0027             Kate Goodall posted this throwback photo of of her man Harry Kane scoring on his debut for England against Lithuania in 2015 with the words, \u0027What a long way you\u0027ve come!\u0027            Becky Vardy, who is unofficial leader of the English WAGs in Russia, posted this photo as she flew to Moscow this morning ready for the game with the caption: \u0027Come on England\u0027            Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife also posted this photo on Instagram as she gets ready to cheer on the boys            Model Lauryn Goodman, who is dating England star Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother, is in Red Square to show her support - and says she is \u0027excited\u0027 about tonight\u0027s big matchGeorge Lee, 59, from Hull, also backed Southgate\u0027s young team to get to the final, predicting a 2-1 win.He said: \u0027We thought we\u0027d do well because you\u0027ve got all the youngsters in now, you know there\u0027s no superstars where they just walk about, \u0027I can do what I like\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re all young, hard-working lads. These are good kids, hopefully they will win it for us. It\u0027s exciting times for these young fellas.\u0027Scott Ratcliffe and his 10-year-old son Eliott, who has broken up from school, were in the queue to pick up their Fan IDs, having arrived in Moscow on Tuesday.The 46-year-old, from Four Oaks in Birmingham, said: \u0027Absolutely flying - can\u0027t explain how good it feels, especially after Italia 90.\u0027I couldn\u0027t get there, tried three times so I\u0027ve waited 28 years to get here.\u0027I think it\u0027s going to be very tight, Croatia are not going to be a pushover, by any means.\u0027They\u0027ve got a good side, they\u0027ve improved over the years, but I look at England at the moment and think we\u0027ve got a fantastic side.\u0027You\u0027ve got to look at that squad now and think, you know what, they\u0027re going to get a result.\u0027 Model Lauryn Goodman is in Russia as she is the girlfriend of Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother. \u0027This is my first World Cup game and I just feel that from the semi finals it gets real. It gets serious. I can\u0027t wait,\u0027 she said.  Fans who flew in without tickets were being asked to pay up for tickets at four times the face value.Greedy touts inside Red Square were preying on football fans by selling the best seats with a face value of £326 for £1,750.One fan bought a ticket with a face value of around £100 for £600.Ian Clatworthy, 33, from Solihull said: \u0027I couldn\u0027t come this far and not see the match. \u0027I had a budget of £1,000 so I suppose I\u0027ve done alright but it is a shame for the guys who won\u0027t be able to see the game.\u0027 Meanwhile two more supporters said they felt \u0027lucky\u0027 at only having to pay £800 each for tickets originally costing £100.Alex Bradbury, 26, a West Ham fan, abandoned his lads weekend in Nashville and flew from the US to see the game and he and his friend fellow Londoner Robert Oliver. The advertising executive who works in America said: \u0027Its scandalous that we are being asked these prices. \u0027It\u0027s great that Rob and I have got ours but it hurts a lot to have to pay this amount of money to see your country at the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s always the same when there\u0027s a massive tournament and people have to and be willing to pay these ridiculous prices. \u0027For me and Rob all we have ever heard about is Italy 1990 as we weren\u0027t even born so it\u0027s a dream to see England in the semi final. \u0027This World Cup has cost us a small fortune as we had tickets for the group stages but were put off by the talk of violence and racism. \u0027But since we got in last night, the Russians except for the touts have been amazingly friendly.

We earn less. Indy than the English. I will watch in a bar here.\u0027  Friends Will Carr and Dale Goulding, who made the decision to book flights last Thursday before progress was guaranteed.Mr Goulding, 27, from Clapham Junction, south London, said the plan was to get to the ticket office early and pick up any tickets being resold through official channels, and failing that they would play the touts at their own game.\u0027What the touts are doing is getting people coming to the Fifa ticket office and saying I\u0027ll give you £50 more, knowing they can sell it to and England fan for £150 more,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are going to turn up in our England tops - we\u0027re genuine. We are going to do what they are doing.    England fans travel out to Moscow in force for the semi-final with Croatia on Wednesday    England fans have begun arriving in Red Square ready for Wednesday night\u0027s game against Croatia for a place in their first World Cup final in 52 years at stake\u0027We are going to stand there and say, \u0027any tickets, we need a ticket\u0027, and if that doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027ll go to the ground.\u0027Mr Carr, 25, from Acomb, in York, said the pair knew they had to get to Russia for the game, given neither were alive the last time England played such a crucial tie.\u0027Everyone\u0027s believing,\u0027 he said. Among the first to arrive were Leeds fans Ryan Rodley, 27, and Jordan Gilmore, 29, who landed in Moscow from Manchester via Helsinki.Ryan, who runs a scaffolding firm, said: \u0027We went 1-0 up against Sweden and we were booking our flights which cost £270. \u0027We didn\u0027t know what to expect once we got here. We had no hotel and definitely very little chance of a ticket. But we had to hope.\u0027  Jordan added: \u0027This morning we paid £600 each to some Russian touts outside the official FIFA ticket office. \u0027We didn\u0027t want to risk not getting a ticket as the lines were long and nobody was giving out any information. Now we are all in and it\u0027s going to be great.\u0027 Jonathan Earlman, 33, another of the group who we\u0027re sipping beer on Red Square, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be 2-0 to England. Once we really are in the World Cup final, we\u0027ll sea with the ticket situation. I\u0027ve heard they are going to be around £2000 each.\u0027   \u0027Come on, boys, bring this cup home!\u0027 Paul Gascoigne, Sir Geoff Hurst and Bobby Robson\u0027s widow join chorus of England greats urging Southgate\u0027s Lions to seize immortalityPaul Gascoigne has joined a legion of former England stars including Sir Geoff Hurst urging the team to seize the moment and beat Croatia tonight.The marauding midfielder\u0027s fantastic play - and tears - in 1990 made him a national hero but the team\u0027s semi-final loss to West Germany left the nation heartbroken.  Today Gazza said he hoped that he and others will be crying tears of joy tonight.If the team win it will spark complete pandemonium up and down the land even before they play in the World Cup final against France on Sunday - the first since 1966.     Paul Gacoigne\u0027s football and tears during the World Cup in 1990 elevated him to a national hero (left yesterday) and he and other stars including 1966 winner Sir Geoff Hurst (pictured with Harry Kane) have sent messages of hope and support to Gareth Southgate\u0027s teamHe told the Mirror: \u0027Come on, boys, bring this cup home. You have nothing to fear. To conquer fear, you have to face it. It is OK to cry when you win, then you have achieved something\u0027.  Former England manager Sir Bobby Robson would have been \u0027thrilled\u0027 by the progress of the current side at the 2018 World Cup, his widow has said.            A grieving Bobby Robson after his team\u0027s defeat on penalties to West Germany in 1990Lady Elsie Robson also claimed that the former manager would be willing Gareth Southgate and his team to win the tournament \u0027with every fibre of his being\u0027.Sir Geoff Hurst is \u0027convinced\u0027 England will emulate the success of his 1966 team by lifting this year\u0027s World Cup.The striker - who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final - said the players have the chance to become immortal.And he thinks a 2018 win would bring wilder celebrations - because the tournament is \u00271,000 times bigger\u0027 than it was 52 years ago.Sir Geoff said: \u0027Bearing in mind the last two tournaments were an absolute disaster, if I said before the tournament that we were going to win it I would have been looked upon as being deranged.\u0027But now you ask me today - and we can win it, it\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027I am absolutely convinced it will happen, the interest throughout the country with photographs and videos of people celebrating is like nothing before.\u0027The World Cup is 1,000 times bigger today when we played at the World Cup we weren\u0027t even playing much in Europe and had been beaten in a previous tournament by the USA 1-0.\u0027The advice I would give the England team going into the semi-finals is continue to do whatever it is you are doing. They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027            Sir Bobby\u0027s widow Lady Elsie, who says her husband would be so desperate for England to winThe former West Ham United equalised for England against West Germany in the 1966 final - before clinching the game with two goals in extra time.It was the only World Cup hosted in England - and a crowd of 93,000 spectators filled London\u0027s Wembley Stadium to watch.The Queen and Prince Phillip watched from the stands - with 400 million people tuning in from their living rooms.Sir Geoff added: \u0027When excitement reaches this level, it transcends the sport and it becomes a national event and people who may have not been very passionate before are now doing the opposite because they can\u0027t do or see anything without it being about the World Cup.\u0027People will remember exactly where they were at that moment in time. When any sport does well it starts to inspire people and none more so than the biggest sport in this country, football.\u0027He said of his hat-trick: \u0027I don\u0027t think I would be sitting here talking to you having scored three if we would have got beat in the final.\u0027That record still stands - it\u0027s hard to beat but it is nowhere near as important as the team winning the game.\u0027   \u0027So hard to concentrate... please can it be 7pm already?\u0027 Anxious England fans post hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work ahead of tonight\u0027s World Cup clashAnxious England fans are posting hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work as they count down the minutes to the historic World Cup clash with Croatia.Workers across the country are struggling to concentrate at their desks as they nervously clock-watch their way through one last shift before tonight\u0027s big match.England will face off against Croatia in Moscow at 7pm tonight, after sailing through their quarter-final clash with Sweden with a 2-0 win.But even after waiting 28 years to reach a World Cup semi-final, the anticipation of just one more day is proving too much for most of England\u0027s workforce.

His tie was affixed in a neat Windsor knot.

Hugh Grant has tweeted he\u0027s taking part, as have presenters Andrew Marr and Jeremy Vine.Why the waistcoat resurgence?

But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix.

It will not be an official state visit with all the pomp and circumstance that comes with such a designation but, instead, a working visit.While her husband meets with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Melania will have her own agenda with Philip May. Melania\u0027s charm offensive: First Lady chats with Brigitte...He loves a parade: Trump to watch military display with...Awkward!

She also met with school children at the Beijing Zoo in China and took a private tour of the Great Wall.She also tends to focus on children\u0027s hospitals when she travels aboard, having spent time with sick children on five of her last foreign trips.          Melania Trump will have her own agenda and events during the Europe trip          Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin, US First Lady Melania Trump, Argentinia\u0027s President Mauricio Macri, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a G20 banquet in Hamburg last July          Melania Trump\u0027s events will be tied to her Be Best, kids\u0027 campaignWhen she was in Brussels last May for the NATO meeting, she stopped by the Queen Fabiolo Children\u0027s Hospital, where she spent time doing arts and crafts, posing for selfies, and giving lots of hugs. She also brought gifts for the children, including Dr. Seuss books and souvenirs from the White House. In Italy, the first lady charmed children she visited at the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome when she spoke to them in Italian. She also visited the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris.And she visited Hadassah Medical Organization, a leading Israeli hospital that is also known as a center of coexistence between Arabs and Jews, when she joined the president in the Middle East last May. After London, the first couple will head to Scotland, where Trump\u0027s mother was born and the president is expected to visit at least one of his golf courses. The last time he was in Scotland was as a presidential candidate. Finally they\u0027ll head to Helsinki for the president\u0027s sit-down with Putin.Melania Trump has had one-on-one time with Putin before. During a G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last year she and Emanuela Mauro, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni\u0027s wife, sat on either side of the Russian president. She also ran interference with the president and Putin when the White House dispatched her to interrupt  a Trump and Putin meeting that was running overtime.Their scheduled 30 minute sit-down went on for two hours and 16 minutes.\u0027Several times, I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door, and I think they even sent in the First Lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn\u0027t work either. We went another hour after she came in to see us, so clearly she failed,\u0027 then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said after the meeting. In addition to this being her first overseas trip since her kidney procedure, it is her first foreign travel this year. She did not join the president on his two earlier overseas travels - the G7 summit  in La Malbaie, Canada nor his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.She wasn\u0027t allowed to fly, the president told reporters.   One game at a time and we can win like Southgate, says steely PM | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/09/4DF2341400000578-5921375-image-a-10_1530864874281.jpg","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo toilet Harry Kane babywear Chinese firms use stars names trademarks","story":"Cristiano Ronaldo (left), known as \u0027C Luo\u0027 (C罗) in China, has seen his name being used to sell ties and dietary supplements.

Chinese firms are using England\u0027s captain Harry Kane\u0027s (right) name, \u0027Ha Li Kai En\u0027 (哈里凯恩), to sell various garments, including babywear (file photo, left), swimming suits and skirtsSome of the applications were submitted by the football stars themselves though.Messi filed seven trademark applications in China in 2007 for a wide range of merchandise, including deodorant, toothpaste, postcards, alarm clocks and board games.On the other hand, Cristiano Ronaldo has 15 \u0027C Luo\u0027 applications made by himself in China to cover some rather unconventional businesses, including computer software, gemstones, Christmas decorations and even nursing homes.   MailOnline has reached out to the representatives of the footballers for comments.  Brazilian Neymar\u0027s (left) name \u0027Nei Ma Er\u0027 (内马尔) is used to sell tyres while Uruguayan Suárez (right), or \u0027Su Ya Lei Si\u0027 (苏亚雷斯), probably doesn\u0027t know there are \u0027Suárez\u0027 pots and pansFootball is one of the biggest sports in China, and successful football players are well loved by people of all age groups - from children to pensioners. But Chinese companies have a history of using the images and names of international  stars without  their knowledge or consent.The two most famous cases involved David Beckham and Brazilian footballer Ronaldo. In 2009, a company used a video clip of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - to sell its Viagra-style, erectile dysfunction drugs in a TV advert, which was aired in prime time across the country.In the advert,  the image of Beckham was given a male voice-over, which gushed \u0027this is my secret weapon to satisfy Victoria\u0027.Beckham had not agreed for his likeness to be used and was said to be furious about the advert, according to a previous report.The drug was made by Beijing-based Sheng Shi Wei Tu International Biotechnology.A sales manager from the company told Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post that the advert had been approved by the Chinese authorities.          Brazilian footballer Ronaldo is shown apparently holding a box of Golden Throat sweets in an advertisement in 2003. The famous player hadn\u0027t agreed to the usage and sued the company          The image of David Beckham - together with Victoria Beckham - was used by a Chinese company to sell its erectile dysfunction drugs in a nation-wide infomercial in 2009In 2003, Brazilian footballer Ronaldo\u0027s image was used by  a pharmaceutical company, Golden Throat, without his consent.In the TV and printed advertisements, Ronaldo was seen smiling while holding a box of the company\u0027s throat-soothing sweets.The TV advert was aired extensively on national networks, including Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, for as long as three years.China Daily reported  that Ronaldo complained about the \u0027illegal\u0027 usage in 2007 and even hired lawyers to prepare for a lawsuit against Golden Throat.The report claimed that Ronaldo had missed seven contracts with an estimated total worth of €22.4million (£19.8million) a year because of the Golden Throat advertisements. However, the lawsuit didn\u0027t proceed due to unexplained reasons, reported Chinese financial news site yicai.com. Golden Throat subsequently replaced Ronaldo\u0027s image with that of Kaká, another Brazilian football player. Kaká was officially contracted by Golden Throat and was paid 14.3million yuan (£1.62million) for three years for the advertisements, according to yicai.com.           Chinese diary company Mengniu has allegedly paid £4.5 million for Messi to be its ambassador          Wahaha, a large beverage company, is the sponsor of Portugal national football team in ChinaChinese people\u0027s passion towards football stars is simply unbelievable. Any products with a football star\u0027s name or likeness associated to them would sell like hot cakes.On the other hand, Chinese copyright law and image rights are notoriously complicated, a factor that the advert makers may have considered would protect them from a lawsuit.While small Chinese firms compete to be the first to register football stars\u0027 Chinese names as trademarks, more and more high-profile Chinese brands  are shelling out to sign international football stars to represent their products.Mengniu, China\u0027s second-largest dairy company and an official sponsor of World Cup 2018, has hired Lionel Messi to be its ambassador. The signing fee is said to be 40million yuan (£4.5 million).Wahaha, China\u0027s largest beverage company, inked a deal with Portugal national football team earlier this year to be their official World Cup sponsor in China.Wey, a made-in-China car brand, engaged Cristiano Ronaldo in a minute-long advertisement to be aired throughout China during World Cup. Ronaldo is also the latest ambassador of the auto label, which is a namesake of its billionaire Chinese founder Jack Wey (魏建军).          Chinese President Xi Jinping is known for his passion for football. Xi (centre) is seen kicking a Gaelic football as he visits the Croke Park in Dublin on February 19, 2012These impressive commercial contracts also came after China Super League teams had spent billions in the past few years to buy top-notch players from European clubs.Meanwhile, Chinese advertisements are ubiquitous in the Russian stadiums during this year\u0027s World Cup - even though team China is not even in the game. Perhaps Chinese president Xi Jinping\u0027s passion for football could help explain the country\u0027s craze for the game. Xi once said: \u0027I am a football fan. Chinese football has been trying very hard.\u0027The leader\u0027s three wishes are for China to qualify for the World Cup, host the World Cup and win the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s the secret weapon with which I can satisfy Victoria\u0027: David Beckham used to sell anti-impotence drugs in China... without him knowing | Daily Mail OnlineRonaldo to sue China\u0027s Guangxi Golden Throat Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19EFFE00000578-5938909-image-m-112_1531256425297.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan land Dublin embark overseas tour married couple","story":"Go for glamour like the Duchess of Sussex in an Emilia Wickstead dressShop the designer at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe Duchess of Sussex has been one busy lady these past 24 hours having gone from Prince Louis\u0026#39 christening, to commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force and now to Ireland with Prince Harry.As she embarks on her first overseas tour since officially joining the Royal family, all eyes will most definitely be on what Meghan is wearing.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet! Meghan puts on a confident display on the Buckingham Palace balcony one month after her nervous debut at Trooping the ColourShe\u0027s less than two months into her role as the Duchess of Sussex, but today Meghan Markle proved she\u0027s finding her feet during celebrations for the RAF Centenary.The former Suits star looked poised and confident as she joined the royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the flypast, which saw the largest concentration of military aircraft in recent memory form in the skies above London to commemorate the milestone.The Queen, 92, looked up in wonder at the aeronautical display, which celebrated the history of the RAF and featured the return of Second World War aircraft including the Spitfires and Lancaster bombers, and followed a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey earlier today.          The Duchess of Sussex showed off her new confidence today as she stood in pride of place alongside the Queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the RAF centenary celebrations           The former Suits star seemed nervous during her Buckingham Palace debut at Trooping the Colour exactly a month ago           Meghan looked at ease as she smiled warmly at her new husband Prince Harry           Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, were allowed to watch the spectacle from a window of the palace          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who yesterday christened their son Louis, appeared in excellent spirits on the balconyShe was joined on the balcony by her sons, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, the Duchess of Cornwall and the \u0027Fab Four\u0027: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.But tellingly, it was the Duchess stood in pride of place alongside Her Majesty who is these days usually flanked by one of her sons in the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh.It was a sharp contrast with Meghan\u0027s balcony debut at Trooping the Colour exactly one month ago on 10th June, when the retired actress was seen looking to her husband for reassurance and nervously fidgeted with her hair.And she did her best to blend into the background, standing behind the Duchess of Cambridge and sticking close to Harry\u0027s side.

I remember the Battle of Britain being fought in the skies above us, and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.\u0027In 1918, my father, King George VI, served alongside one of the Service\u0027s founders, Lord Trenchard, before becoming the first of my family to qualify as a Royal Air Force pilot. That family tradition continues to this day: The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales and The Duke of Cambridge have all earned their Wings, and wear them with great pride.\u0027The Royal Air Force has won a place in the heart of our Nation, and I wish All Ranks, past and present, together with your families, every good fortune for your second century of service.\u0027          The Duchess of Sussex donned a black fit-and-flare dress for the occasion, one of her most high-profile as a royal          Prince Charles, who attended the event in military uniform, looked in excellent spirits as he spoke to guests          Prince Charles holds court as he speaks to young members of the Royal Air Force at a Buckingham Palace reception           The Duchess of Cornwall, 70, sipped on what appeared to be a glass of wine as she mingled with guests at the reception           Prince William looked delighted as he spoke to 95-year-old Jock Heatherill, wing commander of 158th squadron, Halifax\u0027s          The Duchess of Sussex charmed guests as she joined her new husband Prince Harry at the reception          The Duchess of Sussex charmed guests as she joined her new husband Prince Harry at the reception          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex looked lovingly into each other\u0027s eyes as they attended the receptionThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appeared in excellent spirits throughout the engagement and could be seen sharing a light-hearted moment together.Today also saw several moments where Prince William, 36, was seen joking with his sister-in-law the Duchess of Sussex, reflecting the close bond between the pair.Earlier the family attended a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey, a day after attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening, at St James\u0027s Palace, attended by Harry, Meghan, Charles, Camilla and the Middletons.But the Queen and Prince Philip were not there because of a busy week for the 92-year-old monarch, including Trump\u0027s three-day visit to the UK from Thursday  Duchess in Dior!

They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027                                                    His youthful side have become one of the stories of the tournament, reaching the semi-finals with a fresh and stylish philosophy that bodes well for the future.And no matter what happens tonight, Southgate insists their World Cup run is merely the beginning of what he believes will be a fruitful legacy.\u0027I\u0027ve been involved in all the plans through the age groups,\u0027 added Southgate.\u0027To have seen our younger teams have success is hugely rewarding. We know our academies are producing technically good players.\u0027We made a lot of changes with the national teams but lots of changes that helped us to be successful. We believe we have to continue doing that, constantly evolve and improve. This team, the same. The experiences of the last few weeks, the milestones they\u0027ve hit, are a great reference point moving forward.\u0027We have players in this squad who will take us forward and others coming through the age groups with belief they can win but also expectations that we should be in latter stages more regularly.\u0027Many have turned to the black market to try to get tickets for England\u0027s first semi-final in 28 years. Last night ticket touts were operating outside the Fifa ticketing centre near Dobryninskaya Metro station as England fans arrived in Moscow trying to find tickets.In desperation, some fans walked around Red Square wearing placards pleading for entry to the match.Patrick James, 26, from Welling, Kent, arrived in Moscow on Monday. Within hours he had turned to a World Cup Facebook page which saw those keen to get rid of tickets offering them to the highest bidders.He said: \u0027Basically, I went on the site and within an hour I had about 15 people – a lot of them Russians – offering category one and two tickets which cost between £200 and £330 for the semi-final for twice that amount.\u0027In the end I have agreed a £500 price with a guy I am going to meet four hours before the kick-off near the stadium.\u0027He is a Russian fan and obviously disappointed his team went out of the competition. But for me this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don\u0027t want to miss it.\u0027          The wives and girlfriends of England players have sent their love and support for the boys by posting pictures of them kissing after matches including Rebekah Vardy and Harry Maguire\u0027s partner Fern Hawkins          Elton John posted pictures of his boys in their football shirts ahead of the game tonight           Pupils, parents and teachers at Padnell Infant School in Portsmouth sent their best wishes to former student Gareth Southgate          Staff at Next\u0027s headquarters in Leicester have got into the spirit of the big game by wearing shirts and having flags on the reception desk          Nortree Motor company in Melksham, Wiltshire, have given some of their cars some very special numberplates for the day            Up to 10,000 England fans are trying to get to Russia for the biggest World Cup for a generation          England\u0027s win over Sweden in Samara on Saturday put the team one game away from the final          Boss Gareth Southgate puts his arm around star striker Harry Kane after beating Sweden and the nation will watch them with excitement and trepidation tonight  It\u0027s Red, White and Blue Square!

William said: \u0027Come on England - it\u0027s coming home!\u0027 Among the supporters who have made the trip were father and son Joe and Andrew Settle, from Bolton, who have never travelled away with England but decided they could not miss the chance to see the national side in a World Cup semi-final.For Joe, 62, it will be his first live England match. He said: \u0027I\u0027m hoping their (Croatia\u0027s) luck has run out. Two penalty shootouts and they weren\u0027t that good, they just scraped through. I think it\u0027s our year this time.\u0027There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station. And they\u0027re just thinking, \u0027we\u0027ll get behind these lads\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re not bothered about the money, they look like they are enjoying it, they want to do it and they\u0027re proud to do it for their country.\u0027He predicted a 2-0 England win and said he believed the celebrations would be on a larger scale than in 1966 if England go on to win the trophy.\u0027I remember watching 66 on TV as a little lad and going outside playing football afterwards until it was dark,\u0027 he said.\u0027It was very uplifting for the country but because there was no internet, not as much media, you didn\u0027t actually know what was going on.\u0027There were some newsreels and everybody was uplifted but this time, from every part to the country, you are going to see what\u0027s happening - it\u0027s going to be brilliant.\u0027             Kate Goodall posted this throwback photo of of her man Harry Kane scoring on his debut for England against Lithuania in 2015 with the words, \u0027What a long way you\u0027ve come!\u0027            Becky Vardy, who is unofficial leader of the English WAGs in Russia, posted this photo as she flew to Moscow this morning ready for the game with the caption: \u0027Come on England\u0027            Jamie Vardy\u0027s wife also posted this photo on Instagram as she gets ready to cheer on the boys            Model Lauryn Goodman, who is dating England star Marcus Rashford\u0027s brother, is in Red Square to show her support - and says she is \u0027excited\u0027 about tonight\u0027s big matchGeorge Lee, 59, from Hull, also backed Southgate\u0027s young team to get to the final, predicting a 2-1 win.He said: \u0027We thought we\u0027d do well because you\u0027ve got all the youngsters in now, you know there\u0027s no superstars where they just walk about, \u0027I can do what I like\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re all young, hard-working lads.

I can\u0027t wait,\u0027 she said.  Fans who flew in without tickets were being asked to pay up for tickets at four times the face value.Greedy touts inside Red Square were preying on football fans by selling the best seats with a face value of £326 for £1,750.One fan bought a ticket with a face value of around £100 for £600.Ian Clatworthy, 33, from Solihull said: \u0027I couldn\u0027t come this far and not see the match. \u0027I had a budget of £1,000 so I suppose I\u0027ve done alright but it is a shame for the guys who won\u0027t be able to see the game.\u0027 Meanwhile two more supporters said they felt \u0027lucky\u0027 at only having to pay £800 each for tickets originally costing £100.Alex Bradbury, 26, a West Ham fan, abandoned his lads weekend in Nashville and flew from the US to see the game and he and his friend fellow Londoner Robert Oliver. The advertising executive who works in America said: \u0027Its scandalous that we are being asked these prices. \u0027It\u0027s great that Rob and I have got ours but it hurts a lot to have to pay this amount of money to see your country at the World Cup. \u0027It\u0027s always the same when there\u0027s a massive tournament and people have to and be willing to pay these ridiculous prices. \u0027For me and Rob all we have ever heard about is Italy 1990 as we weren\u0027t even born so it\u0027s a dream to see England in the semi final. \u0027This World Cup has cost us a small fortune as we had tickets for the group stages but were put off by the talk of violence and racism. \u0027But since we got in last night, the Russians except for the touts have been amazingly friendly.

We earn less. Indy than the English. I will watch in a bar here.\u0027  Friends Will Carr and Dale Goulding, who made the decision to book flights last Thursday before progress was guaranteed.Mr Goulding, 27, from Clapham Junction, south London, said the plan was to get to the ticket office early and pick up any tickets being resold through official channels, and failing that they would play the touts at their own game.\u0027What the touts are doing is getting people coming to the Fifa ticket office and saying I\u0027ll give you £50 more, knowing they can sell it to and England fan for £150 more,\u0027 he said.\u0027We are going to turn up in our England tops - we\u0027re genuine. We are going to do what they are doing.    England fans travel out to Moscow in force for the semi-final with Croatia on Wednesday    England fans have begun arriving in Red Square ready for Wednesday night\u0027s game against Croatia for a place in their first World Cup final in 52 years at stake\u0027We are going to stand there and say, \u0027any tickets, we need a ticket\u0027, and if that doesn\u0027t work, we\u0027ll go to the ground.\u0027Mr Carr, 25, from Acomb, in York, said the pair knew they had to get to Russia for the game, given neither were alive the last time England played such a crucial tie.\u0027Everyone\u0027s believing,\u0027 he said. Among the first to arrive were Leeds fans Ryan Rodley, 27, and Jordan Gilmore, 29, who landed in Moscow from Manchester via Helsinki.Ryan, who runs a scaffolding firm, said: \u0027We went 1-0 up against Sweden and we were booking our flights which cost £270. \u0027We didn\u0027t know what to expect once we got here. We had no hotel and definitely very little chance of a ticket. But we had to hope.\u0027  Jordan added: \u0027This morning we paid £600 each to some Russian touts outside the official FIFA ticket office. \u0027We didn\u0027t want to risk not getting a ticket as the lines were long and nobody was giving out any information. Now we are all in and it\u0027s going to be great.\u0027 Jonathan Earlman, 33, another of the group who we\u0027re sipping beer on Red Square, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be 2-0 to England. Once we really are in the World Cup final, we\u0027ll sea with the ticket situation. I\u0027ve heard they are going to be around £2000 each.\u0027   \u0027Come on, boys, bring this cup home!\u0027 Paul Gascoigne, Sir Geoff Hurst and Bobby Robson\u0027s widow join chorus of England greats urging Southgate\u0027s Lions to seize immortalityPaul Gascoigne has joined a legion of former England stars including Sir Geoff Hurst urging the team to seize the moment and beat Croatia tonight.The marauding midfielder\u0027s fantastic play - and tears - in 1990 made him a national hero but the team\u0027s semi-final loss to West Germany left the nation heartbroken.  Today Gazza said he hoped that he and others will be crying tears of joy tonight.If the team win it will spark complete pandemonium up and down the land even before they play in the World Cup final against France on Sunday - the first since 1966.     Paul Gacoigne\u0027s football and tears during the World Cup in 1990 elevated him to a national hero (left yesterday) and he and other stars including 1966 winner Sir Geoff Hurst (pictured with Harry Kane) have sent messages of hope and support to Gareth Southgate\u0027s teamHe told the Mirror: \u0027Come on, boys, bring this cup home. You have nothing to fear. To conquer fear, you have to face it. It is OK to cry when you win, then you have achieved something\u0027.  Former England manager Sir Bobby Robson would have been \u0027thrilled\u0027 by the progress of the current side at the 2018 World Cup, his widow has said.            A grieving Bobby Robson after his team\u0027s defeat on penalties to West Germany in 1990Lady Elsie Robson also claimed that the former manager would be willing Gareth Southgate and his team to win the tournament \u0027with every fibre of his being\u0027.Sir Geoff Hurst is \u0027convinced\u0027 England will emulate the success of his 1966 team by lifting this year\u0027s World Cup.The striker - who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final - said the players have the chance to become immortal.And he thinks a 2018 win would bring wilder celebrations - because the tournament is \u00271,000 times bigger\u0027 than it was 52 years ago.Sir Geoff said: \u0027Bearing in mind the last two tournaments were an absolute disaster, if I said before the tournament that we were going to win it I would have been looked upon as being deranged.\u0027But now you ask me today - and we can win it, it\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027I am absolutely convinced it will happen, the interest throughout the country with photographs and videos of people celebrating is like nothing before.\u0027The World Cup is 1,000 times bigger today when we played at the World Cup we weren\u0027t even playing much in Europe and had been beaten in a previous tournament by the USA 1-0.\u0027The advice I would give the England team going into the semi-finals is continue to do whatever it is you are doing. They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027            Sir Bobby\u0027s widow Lady Elsie, who says her husband would be so desperate for England to winThe former West Ham United equalised for England against West Germany in the 1966 final - before clinching the game with two goals in extra time.It was the only World Cup hosted in England - and a crowd of 93,000 spectators filled London\u0027s Wembley Stadium to watch.The Queen and Prince Phillip watched from the stands - with 400 million people tuning in from their living rooms.Sir Geoff added: \u0027When excitement reaches this level, it transcends the sport and it becomes a national event and people who may have not been very passionate before are now doing the opposite because they can\u0027t do or see anything without it being about the World Cup.\u0027People will remember exactly where they were at that moment in time. When any sport does well it starts to inspire people and none more so than the biggest sport in this country, football.\u0027He said of his hat-trick: \u0027I don\u0027t think I would be sitting here talking to you having scored three if we would have got beat in the final.\u0027That record still stands - it\u0027s hard to beat but it is nowhere near as important as the team winning the game.\u0027   \u0027So hard to concentrate... please can it be 7pm already?\u0027 Anxious England fans post hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work ahead of tonight\u0027s World Cup clashAnxious England fans are posting hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work as they count down the minutes to the historic World Cup clash with Croatia.Workers across the country are struggling to concentrate at their desks as they nervously clock-watch their way through one last shift before tonight\u0027s big match.England will face off against Croatia in Moscow at 7pm tonight, after sailing through their quarter-final clash with Sweden with a 2-0 win.But even after waiting 28 years to reach a World Cup semi-final, the anticipation of just one more day is proving too much for most of England\u0027s workforce.

Of the 90 exhibitions that fill the city’s museums and cultural spaces, five core shows have been selected and curated by the photographer Cristina de Middel, best known for her Afronaughts series, a playful reimagining of Zambia’s short-lived 1960s space mission. In Middel’s world, play isn’t a time-wasting, puerile distraction but an essential part of creativity. It is an invitation to stop and think differently. For this show of works by Magnum photographers, Middel and her co-curator Martin Parr searched for the word “players” in the Magnum archive. The resulting images show an unexpected side of the photography agency, bringing up questions about the definition of play and how it pervades everyday life, even in times of hardship.Marking 250 years of the modern circus, this exhibition explores the spectacle and thrill of the art form’s golden age, drawing from the vast collections within the Archive of Modern Conflict. While images of elephants standing on their hind legs and lions jumping through hoops are troubling from a contemporary perspective, they stand as a reminder of how differently joy has been experienced in the past. The show traces the trajectory of the spectacular, from human cannonballs to the nuclear tests in the 1950s. Here, Middel has chosen photographers who play with notions of time, place and scientific reason in unexpected ways. AnaHell’s absurdist series Secret Friends features people in multiple locations around the world, neatly bending their bodies forward to expose their backs. A hastily drawn face and a wig instantly transforms them into comic potato-like caricatures of the everyman.A comprehensive retrospective – and the 2018 PhotoEspaña award – celebrates Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso’s exploration of identity, gender and colonialism in the African diaspora. The exhibition title references his own extraordinary journey from his childhood in Nigeria via Cameroon to the Central African Republic where he fled as a refugee after losing his parents in the civil war. Still a teenager, he became a photographer’s assistant before going on to run his own portrait studio. Fosso’s sardonic humour shines in his early experimental work and his later stylised recreations of black photo icons.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

The publisher’s new 700-page philosophical tome was selling unexpectedly well. Was it because Jean-Paul Sartre’s thoughts on freedom and responsibility in Being and Nothingness resonated with Parisians enduring Nazi occupation? Not quite. It was because the book weighed exactly one kilogram and so was a perfect substitute for copper weights, which had been sold on the black market or melted down for ammunition.Agnès Poirier’s engaging romp through the decade in which Paris rose from wartime shame to assert its claims to be world capital of art, philosophy and turtlenecks teems with such vignettes. When Ernest Hemingway arrived in Paris with fellow allied liberators in August 1944, for instance, he parked his Jeep outside 7 Rue des Grands Augustins – Picasso’s wartime studio. No one was in, so he left his impeccably butch calling card – a bucket of grenades, plus a note reading: “To Picasso from Hemingway”. Poirier never tells us what happened to those grenades.In one of my favourite moments Simone de Beauvoir pauses on the Pont Neuf after a nuit blanche of drinking with Sartre, Arthur Koestler and Albert Camus. Looking sadly into the Seine, she sobs over the tragedy of the human condition. “I do not understand why we do not throw ourselves into the water!” she wails to Sartre who, also crying, replies: “Well, let’s do it!” It would take a heart of stone not to laugh.But what is the human condition? Sartre defined it shortly after the liberation. “We were never freer,” he wrote, “than during the German occupation. Since the Nazi venom was poisoning our very own thinking, our every free thought was a victory. The circumstances, often atrocious, of our fight allowed us to live openly this torn and unbearable situation one calls the Human Condition.” But, Poirier points out, that freedom was dubiously won. De Beauvoir signed a form denying she was Jewish so she could continue teaching in occupied Paris. While she and Sartre were never freer, Parisian Jews were being rounded up by Parisian cops and murdered in Nazi death camps.Celebrity collaborators, too, in on-trend if unwitting existentialist fashion, defined their moral characters through what they did rather than what they thought – and later came up with shameless rationalisations. Arletty, star of Marcel Carné’s film Les Enfants du Paradis, justified sleeping with the enemy by mapping her body as semi-autonomous regions. “My heart is French, but my arse is international,” she said. During interrogation by the resistance, actor and playwright Sacha Guitry was asked: “Why did you have dinner with Hermann Göring?” “Out of curiosity,” he witlessly replied.Poirier, though, risks soft pedalling these evasions and self-delusions since, ardent Parisienne that she is, she wants to tell a love story. In her narrative, everyone who is creatively or intellectually anyone is seduced by Paris. Her enviable cast of characters – not just existentialist philosophers but Samuel Beckett, Alberto Giacometti, Juliette Greco, Jean Cocteau, Simone Signoret, and wave after wave of oversexed, overpaid Americans – are libidinous multi-taskers, overturning bourgeois norms while philosophising, be-bopping, pill-popping and bed-hopping.In her first book, Touché: A French Woman’s Take on the English, Poirier was unexpectedly captivated by repressed, anti-intellectual, ill-groomed rosbifs, but here she returns to her first love, Paris, and, as happens when you’re besotted, allows herself much poetic licence and novelettish prose. Here are Norman Mailer and his wife on their way to French classes. “Every morning, wearing layers of woollen sweaters, they walked through the Luxembourg Gardens towards the Boulevard Saint-Michel and the Sorbonne, all the while conjugating subjunctive verbs and kissing.” Oh come on. Every morning?Mailer was one of many Americans bankrolled by the fabulous-sounding GI Bill. That legislation, so far as I understand it, paid for veterans to return to Paris, learn French and get laid. The Americans in Paris who prove most sympathetic in Poirier’s story are black. She traces the experiences of three African Americans – Richard Wright, James Baldwin and Miles Davis – each blindsided by finding romance and creative stimulation away from the US. Poirier, though, doesn’t nail why Paris, today hardly a byword for racial harmony, was then so appealingly colour blind.She is also, unusual for a Parisienne, philosophy light. If you want to know how Sartre regaled Café de Flore waiters with his “phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny” monologue, try Sarah Bakewell’s recent At the Existentialist Cafe. Poirier is more infectious in her enthusiasms than Bakewell, though – so much so that when grumpy Saul Bellow arrives in town as everyone else is partying like it’s 1949, it’s hard not to share her exasperation. His New World ressentiment for Paris’s charms makes him determined to have no fun.And yet, in Poirier’s story, Paris seduces even Bellow in the end. She writes: “On the first bright spring day of 1949 the Paris street cleaning system gave Saul Bellow the breakthrough that would lead directly to the Nobel prize in literature.” He had an epiphany while contemplating the waters with which Paris gutters are daily swilled. Those free-flowing rivulets released his writer’s block, helping him realise the “untamed and unabashed” sentences of his first masterpiece, The Adventures of Augie March. That “directly”, though, typifies Poirier’s tendency to overstate how Paris shaped postwar culture.Only twice did her love letter make me choke on my citron pressé. While I tip the proverbial beret to 1940s Paris for creating circumstances for De Beauvoir to write The Second Sex, I refuse to follow Poirier in taking Brigitte Bardot as De Beauvoir’s feminist sister. It was Bardot, after all, who recently called the #MeToo movement “ridiculous”, adding: “I found it charming when men told me that I was beautiful or I had a nice little backside.”Throughout, too, Poirier describes Paris as the place where everyone from Sartre to De Gaulle was working out a third way between the twin cold war barbarisms of American consumerism and Stalinist totalitarianism. That idealism, she argues, resulted in the European Union, an outfit conceived by the visionary civil servant Jean Monnet in Paris in the late 40s. That something is awry with this story becomes clear when Poirier invokes Harold Macmillan, who wrote the 1938 book The Middle Way, as intellectual precursor. It’s implausible that the existentialist Marxist Sartre was even then on the same page as Britain’s future Conservative prime minister, still less De Gaulle, France’s future reactionary president.The EU could be seen not the way Poirier sees it, as Paris-created bulwark, but as sociologist Wolfgang Streeck envisioned it – a deregulation machine exposing its citizens to capitalism gone wild. I would argue that, were Sartre and De Beauvoir alive, they would share Streeck’s view. But let’s not leave Paris without yielding, just a little, to Poirier’s rose-tinted image of its charms. Interviewed for the book, Juliette Greco recalled evenings 60-odd years earlier, strolling with Miles Davis from jazz club to bistro, as their love blossomed. She was white, he black, she had no English, he no French. “I have no idea how we managed,” she laughed. “The miracle of love.” Or the miracle of Paris, which is much the same thing.• Left Bank is published by Bloomsbury.

Even for one whose situation is perfectly satisfactory, imagining a total disruption can beguile. It’s the ultimate rebellion against mortality, for potential is nearly synonymous with youth. We are born wandering an intact Pangaea of possibility the choices we make, and the years ticking by, break continents away under our feet until we are each left standing on a small personal island of identity. There we are deemed to be in our final form and can be spoken of as having ended up. The urge toward self-reinvention goes deeper than the risible “midlife crisis” of popular culture it’s a cri de coeur from that island, insisting: “I am more than I seem.” Even, “The world is bigger than this.”Upheaval can pose fundamental questions about identity. Our small islands have been shaped by us, but have shaped us as well. In my novel The Possible World, three characters each find themselves abruptly spilled into unfamiliar lives: six-year-old Ben, the only survivor of a brutal crime his doctor Lucy, facing the dissolution of her marriage centenarian Clare, harbouring her own story of cataclysm, carrying secrets that will affect the destiny of the other two. All of them struggle with memory, identity and meaning while seeking a way forward into their new lives.Maybe we read about disruption to avoid having to undergo it. Here are some books that offer vicarious experiences of mayhem and renewal:1. Life After Life by Kate Atkinson (2014) The riveting saga of Ursula Todd, who is born and dies in 1910 and is then reborn again and again into the same life, things going a little bit differently each time. She carries memories forward, and as the world marches through one war and then into another, the reader wonders if she will be able to budge the course of history. It is a masterpiece. I strongly recommend the audiobook the narrator Fenella Woolgar’s performance is a tour de force of its own. 2. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (2017)At first we might pity Eleanor, the 30-year-old odd-bird outcast who lives in a rut of lonely vodka weekends and supermarket pizza. When a sudden passion for a pop star jolts Eleanor out of her track and she resolves to remake herself, her journey out of isolation is hilarious, surprising and poignant. The book doesn’t shy away from serious themes – “loneliness is the new cancer”, Eleanor says – but the sadness is perfectly balanced with hope. Damaged, quirky and above all resilient, Eleanor is a modern heroine. 3. The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver (1998)Evangelist preacher Nathan Price takes his wife and four daughters from 1950s America to the Congo. The Prices drop into Africa as naively as babes landing in the jaws of crocodiles. Told in multiple voices, this is a coming-of-age story in quadruplicate, as well as a parable about colonial arrogance. A family reinvents itself here, and also a country: the spectacular backdrop is a culture undergoing massive changes of its own. 4. Jasmine by Bharati Mukherjee (1989)A dark odyssey about a suddenly widowed Indian teenager who decides to fulfil her late husband’s cherished dream of moving from Punjab to Florida. She reinvents herself as needed, from Jyoti into Jasmine, Jazzy, and Jase, and finally into Jane, a 24-year-old Iowan housewife. Her voyage brings her to a crisis: she must decide which of her many selves is the authentic one, and which life can claim to be her destiny. 5. Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts (2003)This epic tome recounts the exploits of an Australian prison escapee who gets off a train into the chaos of Bombay. He disappears into the city, tucking himself into the slums and a vigorous exile. The tale is narrated with an irresistible, can-you-believe-it grin, its author an Australian prison escapee who lived a decade in Bombay. The line between fact and fiction is aggressively blurred. Best not to speculate – simply hang on for the long, wild ride. 6. Wave by Sonali Deraniyagala (2013)The memoir of a daughter, wife and mother, who has all of those identities ripped away simultaneously when her parents, husband and two young sons are taken by the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami. You would not think that anyone could survive such a loss without going mad – and she does go a little bit mad in this short book, which is something of a contained howl. It’s also a brave exploration of grief, and a luminous celebration of her lost loved ones. 7. Fifty Acres and a Poodle by Jeanne Marie Laskas (2000) A fortyish urbanite cherishing a lifelong yearning for open spaces drives past a picturesque farm one day – and buys it. She and her boyfriend upend their lives, and while the story of their adjustment is at many points highly comical, it is not a slapstick romp, it’s an engaging and tender testament to the beauty of the unexpected and the rewards of following your heart. There is indeed a poodle, who stars in perhaps the funniest anecdote in the book.  8. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce (2012) When a mysterious rose-pink envelope arrives for Harold, a 65-year-old man who “doesn’t know anyone anywhere”, it ruptures his stagnant life. His spontaneous decision to walk 600 miles to answer the letter makes a captivating, uproariously funny, often profound pilgrimage story. There are actually two pilgrims in this book, both grappling with buried sorrows and seeking redemption: Harold, walking through the beautifully described countryside, and his wife left behind at home. A deeply sentimental, highly enjoyable book. 9. His Illegal Self by Peter Carey (2008) Che Selkirk never knew his parents, outlaw hippie terrorists who abandoned him to a life of sanitised privilege with his wealthy grandmother. He’s eight years old in 1972 when he opens the front door of his Manhattan home to a woman he thinks might be his mother. When a chance to abscond with her arises, he willingly goes. The two skip across the globe, evading authorities, and end up in the Australian wilderness. In a matter of days, Che goes from upper-crust American to unwashed child savage. A fascinating, highly layered novel. 10. Lady Oracle by Margaret Atwood (1976)From its opening words, “I planned my death carefully,” the reader is consumed by the dilemma of Joan Foster, who has made a habit of secrets. A celebrated poet, a beauty and a wife, she is concealing a past of morbid obesity, a current infidelity and a flourishing career as a romantic novelist. Tripping over her own deceptions, she fakes her death and escapes to Italy.

They’ve exploded in popularity this year, riding the wave of trends like declining car ownership and increasing preference for renting rather than owning outright.These transport systems are quickly becoming ubiquitous – but what role can they play in the cities of tomorrow? The update to Citymapper offers an insight only if the kinks can be worked out – and it’s both more and less transformative than we might hope.Floating transport has obvious appeal to investors, especially those sore to have missed out on the Uber gravy train. Venture capitalists’ enthusiasm to jump on the next big thing in transport is the best explanation for the astounding US $300m (£226m) raised by scooter company Bird, at a valuation of $1.7bn, last month. That was matched this week by Uber and Google’s investment in Bird competitor Lime at a $1.1bn valuation, as the company rolls out (sorry) its bright green scooters to Paris, entering Europe for the first timeUnlike precursors such as docked cycle hire, or fixed-parking car hire (think Zipcar), the initial outlay is very small. There’s no need to build docks or pay cities for permanent parking spaces, and while demand remains high, the numbers are good – really, really good.A Bird scooter, for instance, will conservatively gross about $10 a day, according to Bloomberg’s Brad Stone. That’s five short rides, give or take. The scooter needs to be recharged – a job done by gig economy contractors who are paid $5 per recharged scooter – so the net profit per day is $5. With those figures, a $300 scooter with $50 worth of modifications including the GPS tracker and locking mechanisms, then pays for itself in two months.But simply being profitable doesn’t necessarily mean floating transport is good for a city, and the growth of the sector has been a bumpy ride. A big problem is that pavement is a shared space, and a limited resource. The overcrowding problems San Francisco has seen with Bird scooters are mirrored in London by Ofo bikes – a model where users abandon their vehicles wherever they want inevitably results in pavements littered with out-of-service rides.That can be annoying, unsightly or actively dangerous, depending on the circumstances. In London, parents have complained of having to push prams onto the road to get round piles of bikes, while wheelchair users in LA can find a previously accessible route blocked by a wayward scooters.While floating transport is free from many of the regulatory burdens faced by previous transport startups, it’s not immune. Electric scooters, for instance, can’t easily expand to the UK, because they aren’t legal to use on the road or the pavement. Dockless cycle hire faces similar trouble in Australia, where helmets are required by law.Citymapper is betting, though, that despite hurdles on a regional level, this is the future globally. The app currently has a slim level of integration with most floating transport providers – inidual bikes, cars and scooters will appear on the map, along with information like charge level. But they aren’t yet seamlessly combined with the company’s flagship multi-modal journey planner.When that does happen, as Citymapper has said, the services will be presented like any other mode of transport. If it’s quicker to hop on an Ofo bike and cycle to the tube than it is to wait for a bus, it will show as an option.But the company’s mock-up of how it might look in the app– showing a notional journey from transport-deprived Stoke Newington, in north-east London – conceals some of the potential flaws of floating transport. It’s easy enough to plan a journey that begins with a three-minute walk to a bike and ends with 30 minutes on the tube, but it’s somewhat harder to plan your return trip. Will the bike still be there? Or would you have been better off taking an entirely different route in the first place? (That’s not a hypothetical concern – it has happened to me a few times. It’s worse still when you arrive at a bike you’d intended to use to find it still there but not actually working, because it hasn’t yet been reported and removed from the map.)Floating transport also faces similar problems to those that docked cycle hire discovered in its early years: iniduals’ movement through cities is highly correlated. Rush hour is the obvious example, but other trends become clear if you spend long enough staring at data visualisations of where, say, London’s Santander bikes are at any given time. Try to find a docking space outside Hackney’s Victoria Park at 1pm on a sunny summer Saturday, and eight hours later, you’ll have just as hard a time trying to find a bike to get home with.Now imagine trying to solve that problem without docks where would-be renters can at least wait in the hope that a bike will be dropped off.Many floating transport providers have realised these potential pitfalls, and are taking steps to address them. Some bike providers, for instance, have followed the lead of London’s cycle hire network, and now collect bikes left in out-of-the-way places and drop them near transport hubs. Jump, an e-bike provider now owned by Uber, lets users “preorder” bikes, renting them in advance (and still paying by the minute) to ensure they’re there when they need them.And of course, smart transport planners play their own part. If we could give ourselves over fully to Citymapper and its ilk, religiously following instructions to the letter even on journeys which we think we know, then the app could merrily reroute as and when the circumstances on the ground change, erting users towards bikes that have suddenly appeared for rent, or telling them to hop on a bus if someone’s beaten you to a scooter.But ultimately, floating transport is going to have to learn another lesson that conventional transportation bodies have taken to heart: flexible may be fun, but cities run on reliable.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bacba330eb9ef9923aa479a9f95464dd5e69e6/0_62_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10088b53e93793fb8aeef937ffd79547","title":"america left alexandria ocasio cortez new york primary","story":"The little-known history of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s victory in a New York primary hints at the coming transformation• The moment 28-year-old socialist beats top-ranking Democrat in congressional primary - videoEven at first sight it is exhilarating. The overthrow of one of the most mainstream and senior Democrats in Congress by a 28-year-old Democratic socialist with a radical programme and one tenth of his funding is, you might think, interesting enough.But since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary in New York’s 14th district (meaning she will almost certainly enter Congress in November), I’ve been interviewing some of the people who lit the fuse that caused this detonation. What has emerged is just how marginal and improbable their movement was when it began, and how quickly it is now gaining momentum. A revolution has begun in America, and it is time we understood what it means.While the effort to find and run insurgent candidates arose from the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016, the handful of young people who launched this movement struck out entirely on their own. They had no resources and no political standing. Neither Sanders nor any others in the old guard were prepared to support them or endorse the candidates they found.In a way, this tiny group, Brand New Congress, which evolved into the Justice Democrats, marginalised itself. It wanted nothing to do with a traditional left it saw as being obsessed with positioning. It wanted to escape the shadow of people who seemed stuck in the 1980s, who didn’t take environmental issues seriously or understand the need to challenge structural racism and gender inequality, or to reach millennials trapped in terrible housing and miserable non-jobs. They were mocked, ignored and dismissed as well-intentioned but hopeless idealists. One of them told me how he was literally patted on the head by an older Democrat.At first, it was chaotic. Most of the volunteers they recruited had little or no experience. Some turned out to be wonderful, others less so. Their original aim was to find 400 candidates to challenge both Democratic and Republican incumbents. They sought bartenders, factory workers, small-business people, community organisers, teachers, nurses – ideally people who had never held public office before. While Democratic candidates are usually chosen on the grounds of how much money they can raise, the Justice Democrats looked for people who could not be seduced by big funders. They reasoned that if the people they met had served their communities instead of themselves, they were unlikely to sell out once they were elected.They found plenty of brilliant potential recruits, but without mainstream support they didn’t have the credibility required to convince hundreds of people to give up their lives for an improbable cause. They managed to persuade a few dozen, however, and among them was Ocasio-Cortez. They phoned her, invited her to dinner, and asked her to attend a meeting in Kentucky with other potential candidates, in the hope that they would inspire each other to run. She took her time and toured the 14th district before she agreed.She was, as we have seen, a fantastic candidate: determined, indefatigable, brilliant at explaining complex issues simply and directly. Alexandra Rojas, the campaigns director of Justice Democrats, tells me: “She has a way of making issues that others see as radical seem simple, straightforward and pragmatic.” Everyone I spoke to remarked on her grace and stability, and how she calmly absorbed the dramas that surrounded her bid. Extraordinary local campaigners combined traditional fieldwork with the big organising tactics developed during the Sanders campaign: using proliferating networks of volunteers to fill the jobs usually reserved for staffers.Remarkable as she is, there are others like her. Cori Bush in Missouri, Jess King in Pennsylvania and Kerri Evelyn Harris in Delaware are just a few of those now fighting for Democratic nominations or seats while renouncing big money, relying instead on the enthusiasm of the communities they hope to serve.The Justice Democrats are not expecting all these candidates to win, but hope for a few spectacular victories at the congressional elections in 2018 and 2020, not only replacing corporate, money-tainted Democrats, but flipping a couple of Republican districts as well (look out, for example, for the campaigns by Brent Welder and James Thompson in Kansas). As soon as such people take their seats in Congress, Saikat Chakrabarti, one of the core organisers, tells me the aim is to “legislate the hell out of everything, like the Republicans do … proposing the boldest, biggest ideas on day one”. By 2022, using the momentum gained from a few strategic victories, they hope to run a full slate of new or re-energised candidates. The aim is to create a genuinely populist Democratic party, which neutralises Trump’s brutal demagoguery and speaks to people across the political spectrum who have been alienated by the corruption and drift of mainstream politics.Thanks in part to the supreme court’s disastrous Citizens United ruling, which removed the caps on political spending by lobbyists, US politics is dominated by billionaires and corporations, buying the candidates and policies they want. They can’t be outspent, but they can be outmanoeuvred, by recruiting incorruptible people who can speak past the money. Eventually, the Justice Democrats hope, there will be enough strong and inspiring people in Congress to overthrow this ruling and purge the institutional corruption from US politics.So far, the Democratic party has reacted in two distinct ways. Some senior figures, such as Nancy Pelosi and Tammy Duckworth, dismiss the significance of what Ocasio-Cortez has achieved. Others, such as Kirsten Gillibrand, have suddenly switched positions in response to her victory, echoing her call, for example, for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which has been separating children from their parents on the Mexican border. Both are forms of self-preservation, but if more revolutionary candidates win their races, the second variety is likely to prevail.By understanding how the great reversal in New York happened, we can begin to understand what this movement of outsiders might achieve. It could yet change the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c06acd36dde0b0318e9d0ad330e82eb8c6b7cd5/0_434_4202_2521/master/4202.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49c7eb36890798666f259810a8ec46c7","title":"dominic raab ideologue rights eu brexit","story":"What do we know about Dominic Raab, and what does it tell us about how he might approach his new job as Brexit secretary? Prediction is a fool’s game in Brexit Britain, but as this hardcore leaver settles behind his desk, Raab’s controversial ideology may offer some clues.Brexit poses a serious challenge to many of the rights we take for granted, including workers’ rights and our right to equality, which is not protected by a written constitution. Many of those rights that we enjoy today are in very substantial measure the product of our membership of the European Union, underpinned and developed over 40 years through laws passed and case law developed with British input. Once we leave the EU, any of those rights that originate with our EU membership, for example working time protections and the right to equal pay for work of equal value, are subject to potential removal or restriction by a future government so inclined.And Dominic Raab arrives into his new job with the credentials of someone who may well be so inclined. Our new Brexit secretary is a man who believes the time has come for men to burn their briefs. He has called for an end to obnoxious “feminist bigotry”, and thinks we’ve already sorted equality – for women anyway – so the real cause of advancement should be men’s rights. According to him, we shouldn’t be worried about the gender pay gap because “men work longer hours, die earlier but retire later than women.” In fact, it’s discrimination against men we should be getting exercised about: “from the cradle to the grave, men are getting a raw deal”. Raab’s regressive views aren’t limited to gender. He has a long history of decrying the “excessive protections” of workers’ rights in favour of the rights of business. He has consistently made clear his contempt for regulation. Raab expressly compared Britain to the “rising” power of Singapore in a 2011 report called “Escaping the Straitjacket”. and argued that the “burden of employment regulation” was a “dragging anchor” on the British economy. He called for scrapping the requirement for small businesses to pay those aged under 21 the minimum wage, renegotiating the UK’s treaty obligations with the EU on workers’ rights, and securing a total opt out from European working time regulations.These positions, once considered extreme, now have a seat at the head of the table. For all Theresa May’s assurances that workers’ rights would not be diminished by Brexit, her government inexplicably refused to include that commitment in the EU Withdrawal Act. There’s already been a play by one Tory MP to abolish working time rights. A cynic might say a worsening economic climate sets the scene for a slow but steady culling of rights which we will be told we can no longer afford. Raab’s justification for scrapping these hard-won employment rights was that in the context of a struggling economy, we should put unemployed young people before the rights of those in employment: a dishonest eitheror that assumes the only way to create jobs is a race to the bottom on employment rights.But isn’t Raab a champion of civil liberties, some might ask? It’s true that he’s been very critical both of New Labour’s track record on civil rights, and of Theresa May’s “snooper’s charter”. But that all sits in the context of a lawyer who has a fervent dislike of both the European court of human rights, and the Human Rights Act, which he has unsuccessfully sought to dismantle through the introduction of a British bill of rights. It’s a curious, cherrypicking approach: he seems to believe in an inidual’s right to certain liberties, without recognising that they must sit within a wider, enforceable system of rights that provide remedy against state abuse of power.Despite some appearances to the contrary, Raab is, at heart, an ideologue with dangerous convictions. Notwithstanding May’s guarantees that it won’t happen, Brexit could jeopardise longstanding workplace rights and reverse progress on equality, including on women’s rights. His appointment as the government’s top Brexit negotiator should have us all very worried.• Schona Jolly is a London-based international human rights and equalities lawyer and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78777cf3ed207ed6fd29a93ba9bb748f032312b3/0_140_4214_2528/master/4214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24752d1060ee4cdecad37d41de7a2308","title":"heatwave joke freelancers sun edinburgh show","story":"For the UK workforce, it’s another sweltering day.

Things suddenly seem a bit brighter you’ve almost forgotten that you have no job security, pension or sick leave. Because, on the plus side, you also have no office to get to. Maybe today your office could be a swimming pool, a beach or even a beer garden.As your 9-5 flatmate pops off for her breakfast meeting, competing for oxygen on public transport with other commuters, you breathe a sigh of relief and pop on a swimsuit. Self-employed sunbathing park-dwellers are the envy of every person on a payroll, as they savour that one-hour lunch break catching some rays, shovelling in a tuna niçoise outside Pret. And you’re not wrong: we do indeed have the optimum conditions in place for a Vitamin D-inspired working day. The only thing rapidly wilting in the heat? Self-discipline.There is no line manager checking if you turn up for work on time, or to tell you that it’s inappropriate to send emails in your bikini. You just have your guilty conscience to contend with – and, more importantly, your dwindling bank balance. Chances are, if you’re self-employed, the days you’re failing to work because of the sun, you won’t be getting paid either. Instead of responding to important emails or touting for more work, you are left asking questions like: can you claim a Cornetto as expenses on your tax return if you are convinced your productivity increased exponentially after you consumed it?Loss of earnings don’t come purely from a lack of self-motivation. There are a whole host of additional heatwave costs you hadn’t budgeted for as the CEO of yourself during the AGM you held in your own kitchen at the end of the last financial year:1. Replacing the laptop you melted in the midday sun2. Missed meetings because you’re too sunburnt to Skype3. Sourcing illegal quantities of Piriton on the dark web.Of course, a self-employed plumber in Swansea will incur different heatwave obstacles to those faced by a metropolitan elite writer struggling to scribble down some jokes on a Macbook while drinking an Aperol spritz, so please adjust this list accordingly.Structuring your own working day in these soaring temperatures can be a struggle. Do you spend the morning sending off your late invoices or do you Instagram the incredible tan-lines on your feet? Do you update your website after lunch or do you Google the long-term health benefits of siestas? Do you wrap up the day with that important call or do you go to the nearest watering hole to secure a good seat to watch the next World Cup game? You never realised you were so interested in Saudia Arabia v Uruguay, but suddenly it’s the most important match of your life. Even if you are lucky enough to get sunstroke, which forces you indoors, you can always procrastinate with Love Island on demand and pretend you’re still in the sun.The next day of the heatwave arrives. Do you finish writing your Edinburgh show, or do you write an article for  about not writing your Edinburgh show because of the heatwave … just so you have a valid excuse to spend more time researching the heatwave? For example, did you know nude sunbathing is legal as long as you don’t upset your neighbours? So are we writing this naked?

The watercolour is almost seven metres long and was a study for an even more epic version, now lost, which was 30 metres long and exhibited in Paris in 1817. His only other surviving work on this scale, a view of Constantinople, is now in the Louvre.Curators are considering how to put it on temporary display at the museum’s current cramped space at the Barbican, but it will undoubtedly be a star attraction – just as such panoramas were in Georgian London, as the Imax films of their day – when the museum moves to its new site in the old Smithfield market buildings.The museum raised £200,000 including a grant from the Art Fund charity to buy the painting at a recent Sotheby’s auction. Stephen Deuchar, director of the charity, said its acquisition was a coup for the museum.The museum’s director, Sharon Ament, said there was nothing like it in its collection. “Not only does it highlight London as an important centre of international artistic exchange, it also reveals a fascinating moment in time.”Prévost, who died in 1823, was one of the most accomplished artists working at the height of the craze for panoramas, creating vistas of many major cities. The first purpose-built panorama theatre opened in London in 1792, closely followed by one in Paris, where crowds queued to pay a hefty three shillings to admire the paintings, dramatically lit and stretched around the curved walls of a darkened room. Some were toured in popup panorama theatres, a history that explains why so many known to have existed were destroyed by fire or simply worn out. Prévost made an earlier London view, now also lost, when he visited London after travel between England and France became possible again with the Peace of Amiens in 1802, before Europe was torn apart by the Napoleonic wars. He is thought to have returned when peace was restored after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.His painting shows the city as the Duke of Wellington would have known it, with great parade spaces around Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, and Westminster Abbey dominating the foreground.

But are there deeper reasons behind the sudden love for him?Who is the male fashion icon for summer 2018?Jeff Goldblum. What’s that, you cry? A 65-year-old dude who has been around longer than many of your readers have been alive? You have lost your mind, Freeman! Not yet, my friends. Not yet.Goldblum is one of those perennials – like a fine wine, a little black dress – who gets more delectable with time. Many of us first noticed him in Annie Hall, looking for his mantra, and resembling a tall, dark glass of Guinness. He then debuted his trademark fast-talking geek persona in The Big Chill, later perfected in The Fly. Shall we run through some of Goldblum’s greatest hits? G’wan, treat yo’self! His swarthy weirdness in The Tall Guy, his otherworldly smouldering in Earth Girls Are Easy and, best of all, his legendary purr of a laugh in Jurassic Park. Fans all have their favourite Goldblum phase: some like the fresh-faced innocent of the 70s, others the eccentric silver-haired jazz player of today.Maybe it is true that our tastes are formed in childhood because my favourite Goldblum will always be the shaggy-haired, shag-me faced one of the 80s, whom I first saw when my mother – for reasons that defy comprehension now – took me and my little sister to see Earth Girls Are Easy. Well, let’s just say that the moment Jeff, freshly shorn of his alien fur, steps out of the salon left a VERY strong imprint on an impressionable mind. Hmm. Yes. Mmm.ANYWAY. So, we all know about Goldblum’s enduring appeal – the issue is why is he so relevant now. Well, “Jeff: summer 2018 style icon” was confirmed when he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel in the US, wearing a, shall we say, distinctive shirt from Prada’s autumnwinter 2018 collection. As it happened, Pusha T wore the same shirt the same week and a Twitter poll about who wore it best inevitably named Jeff the winner, because one of them may well be a celebrated hip-hop star, but the other one is Jeff Goldblum, and when you go up against Jeff in the style stakes, my friend, you are a wooden sword and he is drone warfare.Goldblum is having what we in the business call “a fashion moment”. He can be found in GQ, posing in Pucci swimming shorts, larking around in Prada and apparently having the time of his life. Fashion blogs are ablaze with discussions about his essential Jeff-ness, and why it is so essential. The question, really, is why now? Why the sudden love for Jeff from all these Jeff-come-latelies, when he has always been exactly as he is now: goofy, eccentrically dressed, cheerful, handsome? He hasn’t changed, but we must have. How?Well, you will all be relieved to know that I have been thinking about this a lot. Here is my theory: Jeff represents the opposite of everything we are seeing in the US at the moment. While the rest of the country is hopelessly locked in the deranged news cycle, Goldblum comes across as an ethereal eccentric who doesn’t even read a newspaper, let alone a news website. Goldblum doesn’t waste time on social media because he is too busy making a jazz album, hanging out with fellow oddballs in jazz clubs and buying utterly absurd shirts in Prada – because why not? And it has to be said, he looks a lot happier, and better, than the rest of us.More than that, Goldblum represents not giving a damn. Without getting into an “Oh, social media oh, Kardashians oh, narcissism – what a world” rant, Goldblum, for a celebrity, comes across as refreshingly unconcerned with how he looks. The fact that he wore that completely ridiculous shirt on Kimmel sums up his modus operandi: he cares so little about how he looks that it’s cool. He just happens to have an amazing, innate sense of high-fashion, wearing clothes that look absurd and wouldn’t get past any stylist, but are adored by fashion people who, by nature, love absurd clothes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/330c302b905372a7e1163823392037ef05fd22be/0_130_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5abffa6195873480e1b1ce91553eeea3","title":"eighth grade review bo burnham elsie fisher","story":"The directorial debut of comedian Bo Burnham is a wonderfully naturalistic tale of the end of middle school with a standout turn from Elsie FisherThe hellish horrors and swelling triumphs of being 13 are mostly brought to the screen with a detached gloss, the beats of cinematic adolescence rarely lining up with those experienced in real life. In Eighth Grade, comedian Bo Burnham’s wonderful directorial debut, there’s a refreshing avoidance of such artifice, the former YouTuber’s striking big-screen calling card playing out more like a documentary than a standard coming-of-age movie.Words are stumbled over, teenage dialogue borders on inane and the performances are almost entirely naturalistic yet Burnham still guides his film with a distinctive, cinematic hand. It feels real without ever meandering, the work of a skilled curator showcasing his impressive knowledge of the teenage psyche.Burnham’s co-author of sorts is Elsie Fisher, whose lead performance is as integral to the film’s success as his direction. She plays Kayla, a girl whose online presence as a confident, advice-spouting vlogger is wildly at odds with who she is at school: a loner who struggles to connect with those around her. It’s not through lack of trying, though, and in her final days of middle school, she’s determined to make progress with the girls who look down on her and the boys who don’t even look at her before moving on to a major new phase in her life.The story of an awkward 13-year-old girl’s final days of middle school might seem like an odd fit for a male comedian’s directorial debut and at a time when we’re still seeing so many female narratives told through a male lens, it could appear as slightly regressive, especially after Greta Gerwig’s richly observed Lady Bird. But 27-year-old Burnham’s recent past as a viral teen star (since the age of 16, his videos have accrued more than 228m views), has gifted him with firsthand knowledge of what it is like to grow up online and there’s authenticity infused throughout.For Kayla, access to social media allows her to feel superficially connected but being far removed from anything resembling a real social circle means that it can also feel frustrating, the possibility of popularity literally at her fingertips. There’s an acute awareness of the different roles played at that age, depending on the space. On YouTube, Kayla is confident and self-assured, at school she’s nervous and quiet and with her father, she’s irritable and rude. There’s nuance not just in Kayla’s characterization but also in the events that unfold around her.For much of the film, there’s an excruciating focus on the difficulties she encounters, from an uncomfortable pool party to a queasily well-performed scene of harassment, but Burnham avoids an excess of cruelty. This isn’t Welcome to the Dollhouse. He peppers the film with rare, buoyant moments of joy that jump out that much further because they feel so deserved. At one point Kayla is befriended by an older girl, and I found myself as giddily excited as her, a relatively simple life event transformed into a crowd-pleasing victory.Burnham often accompanies moments of extreme emotion, good and bad, with unexpected bursts of EDM, a decision that might sound intrusive but in practice is extremely effective. A bathroom outfit change suddenly evokes palm-sweating terror while Kayla glancing at her disaffected crush across the classroom is transformed into an earth-shaking awareness of attraction. It’s a nifty way of conveying the scale of events that might seem mundane on the surface and helps to tune us into Kayla’s wavelength for the duration. She’s in every scene and our intense investment in her day-to-day is down to a really quite exceptional performance from Fisher.She’s not exactly an unknown (her previous credits include voice work in the Despicable Me franchise) but it feels like she’s an accidental discovery, as if this role was created for her. It’s an uncomfortably real turn, her social anxiety proving horribly familiar to anyone who’s felt out of place, and Burnham’s script never betrays her, refusing to resort to convention in the final act. He understands that victories are small, changes are slow and the future is uncertain and his defiance of expectation leads to a far more satisfying experience. Eighth Grade isn’t easy, both on screen and in life, but it’s a film that should be a rite of passage for all, no matter the age."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb695ad927f6a4f9707c7feefd3472de4aa560f/0_89_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=660187c180d9552c096cc1ebc6f76fe9","title":"joaquin phoenix best roles film","story":"A career filled with unconventional choices has led the Oscar nominee to a banner period working with Lynne Ramsay, Gus Van Sant and Jacques AudiardFor an actor who has cultivated an image of relative Hollywood hermitude, Joaquin Phoenix has been awfully visible lately, fidgeting uncomfortably in a spotlight that nonetheless keeps landing on him. This week, his starring role in Gus van Sant’s Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far On Foot hits cinemas in the US – and depending on where you are in the world, it’s his third major release of 2018 so far.In the UK, the March cinema schedule gave us a particularly disconcerting Phoenix double-whammy. One week, he was a taciturn, tortured assassin exacting grievous violence on toxic men in Lynne Ramsay’s brutal stunner You Were Never Really Here. The next, he was literally Jesus Christ – still taciturn, definitely still tortured, but ostensibly a more benevolent presence – in Garth Davis’s prettily soporific religious drama Mary Magdalene. (Or, as atheistic wags might also call it, You Were Never Really Here.) The performances may have had more in common than they would in the hands of most other actors – you’ve never seen the son of God quite this blearily emo – but the ideological whiplash between the projects was still striking. (With Mary Magdalene still mired in Weinstein Company legal quicksand, Americans will find this out when, if ever, it gets released.)Phoenix isn’t done for the year, either: this autumn, we’ll see his starring role in the darkly comic gold rush western The Sisters Brothers, the first English-language film by the esteemed French auteur Jacques Audiard. By any measure, that’s a robust quartet of projects, at least in terms of prestige and intent (Mary Magdalene turned out to be a critical and commercial non-event, though it wasn’t for want of ambition on the part of anyone involved). Phoenix would have to be pretty spectacular in the Audiard film to supplant You Were Never Really Here as the high point of not only Phoenix’s year, but just about any actor’s: as Joe, the silent-storm hitman concealing tidal waves of trauma beneath a grizzled, ungiving exterior, he brought sore-souled complexity, psychic pain and a stoic streak of gallows humour to what would otherwise be a familiar noir type. It’s a characterisation that ranks with his raddled, feckless sociopath Freddie Quell from Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master as perhaps the richest of his career so far, and it justly won him best actor at Cannes last year by rights, it should net him a fourth Oscar nomination, though the odds are against Academy voters having the stomach for Ramsay’s visceral, despairing film. Perhaps they’ll gravitate toward Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot instead, for which he’s garnered further glowing notices – notwithstanding protests from some quarters about casting an able-bodied actor in the role of a quadriplegic. Phoenix plays the real-life cartoonist John Callahan, with the film tracking his journey to sobriety after the alcohol-abetted car accident that landed him in a wheelchair at the age of 21. It’s the kind of true story that could easily translate into icky inspirational pablum – particularly if the more maudlin Van Sant of Finding Forrester and Sea of Trees had shown up on set – but Phoenix’s presence alone provides the perverse, unsentimental wit that marks Callahan and his work. Now in his 40s, the actor has long shown a knack for crinkling and darkening the edges of even the most straight-and-narrow films, since well before he gave us cinema’s scuzziest Jesus. We saw it as early as 1989, in Ron Howard’s bright family dramedy Parenthood, in which the 14-year-old Phoenix (then still going by the Christian name Leaf) quietly disrupted the sitcom tone of proceedings with his portrait of a withdrawn, nascently porn-fixated adolescent. Eleven years later, he was a thrillingly strange, sinuous ner in the robust Hollywood works of Gladiator, his venal emperor Commodus bringing not just boo-hiss villainy to proceedings, but a streak of vulnerably defensive irony and subtly queer sexuality it was a performance inspired and unsettling enough to earn him his first Oscar nomination. It was the performance that essentially made Phoenix – then 26 and skew-whiff sexy, with that hard gaze and scarred lip that, for the most part, conveniently ruled him out of teenage-dream roles in his formative years – a star. Yet aside from a loopy pair of M Night Shyamalan projects and the handsome, trophy-chasing biopic duty of Walk the Line, in which he was more suited to Johnny Cash’s brand of hard-knock cool than the varnished film-making around him, he rarely acted accordingly. Forgoing studio cinema, he opted for a mixed bag of indies (such the misfires as It’s All About Love and Reservation Road) and developed a solemn, burnished collaboration with the Cannes-beloved, 1970s-inspired American auteur James Gray, culminating in a bittersweet romance, Two Lovers, that was a virtual paean to his anxious, anti-Hollywood-leading-man qualities. That, of course, was the lead-up to I’m Still Here, the ambitious mockumentary stunt that for too long had the world convinced Phoenix was either a buffoon or a critically damaged egomaniac, and over as an actor either way. The convenient narrative would have had critics declaring Phoenix’s hilariously garbled, meta-upon-meta feat of self-parody as his crowning glory, if not for the unexpected upshot on the other side – as Phoenix rebounded from the lark with the most disciplined, detailed, straight-up acting of his career in The Master. Since that watershed, there’s been no fooling about, even when the projects have been playful: Anderson’s Inherent Vice may have been a shaggy-dog stoner odyssey, but Phoenix’s spaced-sad, perfectly behind-the-beat comic delivery in it was perfectly studied. His delicate, nebbishy romantic ache in Spike Jonze’s Her was an unexpected, empathetic twist on his talents, while his Gray collaboration hit an operatic peak with the morally charred balance of evil and regret in his 1920s Ellis Island pimp in The Immigrant, still sadly unreleased in the UK – his final, spiritually wrecked scene in it is up with the best of Brando. There have been missteps, albeit not thoughtless ones. He was saddled with one of the rotten modern-era Woody Allen scripts in Irrational Man, and would likely have proven ill-matched to Allen’s fussy, hyper-verbal neuroses even if he hadn’t been, while as interesting a pick as he is to play Jesus, he seems more glazed than intense in the beige, tasteful surroundings of Mary Magdalene – if it never gets seen stateside, his career certainly won’t be worse for it. But if these are the blurry spots in Phoenix’s filmography as he heads into his middle age, he’s doing well — he’s even toying with the mainstream again, with his casting as the Joker in an upcoming origin story officially, as of this week, a go. That said, with a relatively low planned budget of $55m, Todd Phillips’ film is rumoured to be on the more experimental end of the blockbuster spectrum: the superhero machine may come for them all, it seems, yet Phoenix still gets to do it somewhat on his own terms. With Daniel Day-Lewis supposedly retired and the consensus title of Greatest Working Actor up for grabs, Phoenix’s latter-day CV makes as good a case as any. Not that he’d want to be called that, most likely — but if his recent, inventive run of activity has proven anything, it’s that his can’t-be-arsed persona, sealed in I’m Still Here and still wafting around him a decade later, is one hell of a performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ee03c4e9108dd0490c25ccc3eacad8cbe47689/0_87_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263c655ae9f3ee1417d680103ff2b4b7","title":"psychology england football team change your life pippa grange","story":"England players seem happier and more grounded – and much of the credit goes to psychologist Pippa Grange. What can the team’s approach teach us all about facing fear and failure?This week, the England midfielder Dele Alli was asked if he was nervous about the big tests up ahead: first, of course, the team’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. “Excited, not nervous,” he replied. His apparent happiness and confidence reflected an England team that seems transformed from previous incarnations. Where once it was stuffed with entitled, surly stars, burdened with the weight of history and the pressure of expectations, it now comes across as a hungry, humble team, playing with lightness and joy.“We’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories,” said the manager, Gareth Southgate, after the team beat Colombia in an unprecedentedly victorious (for England) penalty shootout. “Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history … We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.”The team appears in a better place psychologically than it has for generations. Much of the credit has gone to Southgate, but also to Pippa Grange, the team psychologist, who has been working behind the scenes. “She’s an amazing person,” Alli said on Monday. “Everyone listens to her when she talks.”Grange was appointed by the FA as its head of people and team development in November last year, given the job of building resilience while confronting the pressures and psychodramas faced by previous England squads. The FA has said it searched globally for the right person for the job, but Grange, like most of the young players, isn’t an obvious superstar in her field there is no self-promoting social media presence or bestselling self-development books.She wrote in 2013 that being a woman in a male team environment “is a constant navigation, for everyone. I have no interest in being one of the lads and I don’t quite fit in the ‘nurturing mother figure’ category in terms of the leadership work I do. I would be professionally ineffective if I remained in the background, psychologically safe with minimal voice, and I am not here to be the centre of attention as some form of entertainment. I don’t want to be completely separate because that would make me inaccessible and probably be a lonely place to operate from.”The midfielder Eric Dier said: “I think a lot of the work that we’ve done with her has been prior to the tournament starting, over the last six or seven months.” This has reportedly included getting the players to sit down together in small groups to share their life experiences and anxieties, and to reveal intimate truths about their character and what drives them. The point, Southgate has said, is to build trust, “making them closer, with a better understanding of each other”.The England football team has focused on the mental side of the game before, most prominently with the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who was recruited before the 2014 World Cup. What is new is the extent to which psychology has been embraced (prior to Grange’s appointment, the performance consultancy Lane 4 was working with the FA on psychological tactics). Access to Peters, it was reported, was offered to the players only if they felt they needed it – and not many would have admitted to wanting help.“The whole group must buy into the idea that the sports psychologist has come with a specific set of skills and practices that are really worthwhile,” says Andy Lane, the professor of sport and learning at the University of Wolverhampton. “A recent turnaround in professional soccer is the preparedness to use sports science in an integrated way. It’s that acceptance by the whole group that gives one professional the chance to be effective.” Much of that culture shift will have been down to Southgate, who has shown his support for Grange, whom he clearly respects. “She is a strong and important addition to the team,” the manager said in May.Grange is a fan of inspirational quotes, from Oscar Wilde to Nelson Mandela to Michael Jordan some adorn the training gym walls (“Success isn’t given, it’s earned,” reads one). She is also said to encourage the players to get off their phones and play games with each other – including one in the hotel pool with inflatable unicorns after the win against Tunisia in the group stages and she is said to dislike social media, which she expects the players to use wisely. Southgate hasn’t banned social media – unlike previous managers, he hasn’t appeared to ban anything – but has apparently taken Grange’s thoughts on board. While he acknowledged it was good for the players to engage with fans, he added: “Personally, I’m not sure there’s value to reading comments that come in. It comes back to: what creates pressure, or what creates misery in your life?”Michael Caulfield, a sport psychologist and the co-director of the consultancy Sporting Edge, says Southgate, with whom he worked at Middlesbrough, has a leadership style “built on incredible levels of trust between him and his players and staff. He was determined to convince the team there was nothing to fear from playing in the World Cup for England, whereas in the past people were nervous or fearful. He was determined to change that mindset from one of fear to one of adventure. That’s the biggest thing he’s done.”When someone is under a moment of extreme pressure, using a tactic such as mental cues can be helpful, says Kate Hays, the head of psychology at the English Institute of Sport. “People will have cue words that will bring them back into focus on the task at hand – for some, they could be emotional cues for others, it could be technically focused. It’s just one or two words that can get people to focus on the right thing.”Southgate, who has experienced his own disappointments – that missed penalty at the semi-finals of Euro 96, and his managerial career at Middlesbrough ending in relegation – has said as much: “I have learned from things that have gone wrong and had to pick myself up … Because of those failures, I feel it gives you the freedom of being able to say, ‘How might we be the best possible team?’ and not be afraid of what goes wrong – because whatever goes wrong we can deal with, as I have lived through it.”Grange has no fear of failure either. She has written: “I’d like to turn this unhealthy preoccupation with success on its head and put it on the record that I think failure is really useful. For without failure we cannot progress longer, higher or faster. It’s a funny paradox – our successes are achieved through trying, and trying most often ends in failure. Every day in our general lives and our sporting lives we will win some and lose some it’s just part of the way life should be. It could be missing out on a promotion, being pipped at the line in a running race or bombing out in an exam – it doesn’t matter – the important lesson is to learn from our failures, reassess, rethink, move forward (sometimes in a different direction) and keep those dreams and goals alive.”Kevin George, the author of Soccology, who works with clubs and coaches on performance, also says that respecting the inidual qualities and personalities of your players (or your employees) is key. “To instil confidence in one player might be to give them freedom, so they know you trust them,” he says. “For somebody else, it might be a lot of praise. For a group of people, you have to tap into who they are inidually, but as a group, give them the belief that you trust them.” Singling people out for praise in a group setting can be tricky, he adds. “People can think: ‘That person’s a favourite, I’m not a favourite.’ It is tough.” Southgate doesn’t play favourites everyone feels as if they have a chance.The era of hard-talking, tyrannical managers is over – both on and off the pitch. “Football, which I love and work in, is really bad at talking,” says Caulfield. “It does instructing and telling off but it doesn’t do talking and listening and empathy that well. It sounds a bit fluffy but that’s the world in which we now live, and the world in which these players have grown up.” Southgate, he says, realised early in his coaching career that instilling fear wasn’t going to work. “We all need a telling-off now and then – and he’s good at that, by the way – but you’ll get far more from putting your faith in people than you will anything else. People had this lazy opinion that he’s too ‘nice’ and they see kindness as weakness, but it’s the most unbelievable strength if you use it in the right way.”As for nerves, it is a mistake to think it is essential or even desirable to eliminate them – from sport or from life. Caulfield says they can be “wonderful. They keep you alive and make you realise something important is about to happen. If you discuss what the nerves mean to you and how you deal with them, then they don’t become a threat to you. They become this wonderful cortisol that runs through your veins and you deal with the problem, and then you rest afterwards.” With or without an inflatable unicorn.• Don’t fear failure. “Part of what it takes to be courageous is overcoming the constant battle between the desire for what we want and the fear of failure. Most of us don’t expose ourselves because we are fearful,” writes Grange.• Reframe emotions: you’re not “nervous”, you’re “excited” a penalty shootoutjob interviewimportant speech is not something to dread, it’s an “opportunity”.• Positive thinking is unhelpful if you’re simply fantasising about achieving an Oscarthe World Cupa fuller social life. Instead, focus – positively – on the steps that could get you to your goal.• Treat your employeeschildrencustomers as iniduals rather than a homogenous group. Different approaches will work for different people.• Kindness, listening and empathy will take you further than barking orders. Use praise to motivate people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ec00965f13d416b3a5c2562d982e9c87b05e8e/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d63df79ea8aa3b08d9554fef04b8cb3a","title":"chelsea closing in maurizio sarri and manchester city target jorginho transfer window","story":"The Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, has claimed Maurizio Sarri’s move to Chelsea is edging closer and is “in the hands of his lawyers”, with Napoli’s former manager to be followed to Stamford Bridge by the midfielder Jorginho in what could amount to a £57.5m outlay.The Premier League club have been in a state of flux since winning the FA Cup at the end of last season. There has been intense haggling through the summer over compensation payoffs due to the various parties – the current Chelsea head coach, Antonio Conte, would seek payment for the final year of his contract – and that has led to a painfully slow process.Chelsea had hoped resolution would be reached before the players reported back for pre-season medical tests on 7 July, but that came and went with Conte, who has expected to depart all summer, having overseen the start of training proper this week.Napoli appointed Carlo Ancelotti as Sarri’s replacement last month, but have still to release their former manager from his contract. “The Sarri deal is in the home stretch, and it depends on him,” De Laurentiis said on Wednesday. “I’ve laid down my conditions. It’s all in the hands of the lawyers. My lawyers have drafted a text and sent it to his lawyers, and we will see what happens.”Jorginho, a Brazilian-Italian who was handed his first cap for the Azzurri by Conte, may become Chelsea’s first signing of the summer after the player apparently indicated a preference to come to London rather than join the Premier League champions, Manchester City.City, though, are understood to be unhappy with Napoli and De Laurentiis. The champions believe Jorginho does want to join City, having told Napoli two months ago he wants to play for Pep Guardiola. City believe that the player is being used by Napoli as a factor to smooth the proposed move of Sarri to Chelsea.Reports in Italy suggest the 26-year-old midfielder, who has eight caps, would cost Chelsea a little over £50m, with the club likely to pay a further £7.5m to secure Sarri’s release. There have been reports in Italy that Cesc Fàbregas, who has entered the final year of his contract at Stamford Bridge, could join Napoli. But the Spain midfielder is understood to have no interest in moving to Italy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f183e3024872dc0280012487854dc5807048166/0_42_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb8d96a075760c31c39258e56ac5b6a","title":"cristiano ronaldo leaving real madrid end cold","story":"‘Your goals, your numbers and everything we’ve won together speak for themselves,” Sergio Ramos said once the news finally broke. Real Madrid’s players had doubted that it would come to this, that he would really do it and that they would really let him, but this time it was real. Barely minutes after the Champions League final, before the trophy had been handed over, Cristiano Ronaldo said that it had been – past tense – nice being at Madrid. Moments later Florentino Pérez, the president with whom there was little warmth, said he had heard before and in the end nothing ever happens. But he hadn’t, not like this, and in the end it did.The announcement was made at 5.34 Spanish time. After nine years at the Santiago Bernabéu, Cristiano Ronaldo was joining Juventus for €100m (£88.3m), plus €5m to be paid to his former clubs. The 33-year-old has signed a four-year deal reportedly worth around €30m a year, after tax the total cost is estimated to be €345m.That’s a lot of numbers, and there are many more. Sometimes it can feel like that is all there is. As Real Madrid’s captain put it in his farewell to the ‘Bicho’, the Beast: your goals, your numbers speak for themselves. These are not, it appears, days for poetry, which is a pity. If a picture paints a thousand words – and the sports daily AS marked the occasion by leading on one last photo of Ronaldo topless, this time from the Greek island where the deal was closed – then it sometimes seems numbers make them obsolete. The stats say it all. When they are like these, especially: so absurd.When Ronaldo was presented at Madrid, the club’s nine European Cups were lined up at the Bernabéu. He looked at them, impressed. Nine years on, four more have been added – including three in a row, four in five years. This is their most successful era, the best any club has had in the competition since they won the first five titles, led by Alfredo Di Stéfano – the man who changed their history and made them what they are, the man who sat watching Ronaldo that night, clutching his walking stick. Ronaldo also won two league titles, two Copa del Reys, and three Club World Cups.More importantly – and there may be something telling in those two words – Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or five times, and may well make that six this winter, and is the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, unsurpassed in each of the past six seasons. He scored 311 in the Spanish league. He scored 44 hat-tricks, for goodness sake. He scored more goals at Madrid than anyone else, ever. He overtook Emilio Butragueño, Hugo Sánchez, Carlos Santillana, Raúl and Di Stéfano. He averaged more than a goal a game (1.029) only Ferenc Puskas on 0.92 came close. Ronaldo scored 450 goals in 438 games. 451, according to the sports daily Marca.Marca bade “farewell to a legend”, declaring “there won’t be another like him”, by printing the goals across a double-paged front cover: 451 little footballs, one for each strike, marked with the badge of the club that conceded them. The balls fill every space, peppered all across the page a telling image expressing the indiscriminate nature of it, the relentlessness that defines him, the enormity of it all. A useful image too: it can be exhausting just looking at the figures, a sea of digits, and it can also be easy to gloss over them. Some variation on that old line, supposedly introduced by Stalin: one goal is a triumph but 450 of them is a statistic.And while statistics brook little argument, they also leave little room for lyricism. They can reduce everything to numbers, and risk making the extraordinary routine. They normalise it – just another goal, just another hat-trick – when it is not normal. They also make it too easy to leave the analysis there, the eulogies too, failing to invite imagination or a full appreciation of an astonishing footballer who marked an era. “It was nice while it lasted,” one headline said, as if it had not lasted long when this was an entire decade of dominance at the biggest club of them all. Which is part of the problem: it is as if what makes it so magnificent also makes it oddly mundane: Ronaldo? Stupid amounts of goals. And that’s it. But it is not it.Even the one that Ronaldo said was his best, the overhead kick that he scored against the club that is now his own and the goal that sits in the middle of the sea of balls on Marca’s cover, while “framed” by picture desks and declared a work of art, ended up being quantified. Diagrams purported to show how high he had leapt, the angle of his body, like something from an engineering analysis. Man becomes machine. A beast, perhaps. An extra-terrestrial, Álvaro Arbeloa called him.It is a tempting analogy, easy enough to slip into and accurate enough. He is built, after all – a construction, self-made. He did this. His body shape, often exhibited, reinforces that and there are countless stories that relay ambition, weights on ankles, hours in the gym. Even within elite football, teammates recognise he is different there’s a touch of extremism in his application that underpins an admiration which is deep. Paul Clement, assistant coach at Madrid under Carlo Ancelotti, tells the story of the team getting back in the small hours after some away trip in Europe. The rest head wearily home Ronaldo stays at the training ground, plunging into an ice bath.Thus the machine is made and maintained – but that, by definition, is human. He is brilliant because of who he is, and so even if the natural focus is the numbers, it is worth remembering where they come from and enjoying them for what they are. Yet cold stats do not invite warmth counting goals leaves little room to appreciate them. That header in the Copa del Rey final, say although, again, that was text-book in its perfection, inviting diagrams and compasses. The skill, the touch, the quality, the technique, the feeling.The emotion is sometimes lost and the intelligence is overlooked too on occasion: the effort is extreme but it is also targeted, thought through. There has been self-awareness, adaptation. Zinedine Zidane, now departed, was central to that but no one was more central than Ronaldo, whose evolution has been fascinating. His game has become more focused, more limited and yet more effective than ever, and his team have been more successful. That has helped explain why, at 33, Juventus believe the end is not yet nigh: his best years have come when his worst years should have done. He stepped centre stage on the biggest stages past 30. He has said he’ll play until he’s 40 although he wouldn’t be the same, that doesn’t seem so absurd any more.Nothing will be the same now. “He is the best in history with Di Stéfano,” Pérez said in January. Di Stéfano departed sadly too, incidentally. It is impossible to do justice to what Di Stéfano achieved, yet there was Ronaldo being held up alongside him. Perhaps the best player in the history of the most successful club there is, one of the game’s all-time greats.Pérez had said that a “new era” would begin the day that Ronaldo left. Now that he has, this does feel monumental, even if it was coming – like some staging post in life, something lost, a generational shift, the end. Madrid, though, have modified the message, seeking to avoid that melancholy. It has also been important to publicly lay responsibility for this break-up at Ronaldo’s door. There may be blame at some point.For all the coldness of the conclusion to this era, the coldness too of the stats that fill endless pages today, the focal point of the farewell, this move is an emotional one primarily propelled by pride. Looking back on that overhead kick, when Juventus’ fans applauded and Ronaldo, slowly realising, brought his hand to his heart, you wonder if that was the start of something. There he felt the love, the affection, he didn’t feel at Madrid. Signed by the outgoing Ramón Calderón, Ronaldo’s relationship was never close with Pérez, and extra layers were added with time: the case brought against him by the Spanish tax man, the pursuit of other players, the refusal to countenance another renewal. And so in the end he went. Everyone does eventually, but not everyone is the same.His figures spoke for themselves perhaps, but Ronaldo wanted to be heard too. At the end of a career that became defined by the tangible values, quantifiable and counted in goals, there was something intangible he sought. There had been threats before this time, the club decided it could not go on. Now they must confront a new era, and it won’t be easy, they know. It won’t be for anyone: this is one of those deals where it may seem that everyone wins, or perhaps that everyone loses. After the Champions League final, a European champion again, but his mind already elsewhere, Ronaldo had been asked where he would better off than Real Madrid. “Difficult,” he said, “but life is not just about glory.”It is not just about goals either. But, bloody hell, there were a lot of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc038325e70b43b83765294a655645fc5a47164c/202_165_2384_1430/master/2384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15d4847b1343fc9138246b02ec8ad94","title":"croatia england where world cup semi final won or lost","story":"Five tactical posers for Gareth Southgate and Zlatko Dalic, from England’s set pieces to setting up around Mario MandzukicThe big decision Zlatko Dalic has to make lies in midfield.

The danger for Croatia is that Modric ends up too deep, unable to exert the sort of influence he did against Argentina, too tied up with trying to stifle Dele Alli to hurt England.The other option is to bring in Marcelo Brozovic (Fig 2), or perhaps Milan Badelj. That liberates Modric and Rakitic – although Rakitic spent much of that Argentina game tracking Lionel Messi – and poses a problem for England by placing two men in Jordan Henderson’s zone.That would mean Alli having to drop off, assuming England maintain the same triangle in midfield rather than bringing in Eric Dier to play alongside Henderson, or, perhaps, England could rely on one of the back three to step up to offer support at the back of midfield. That would still leave them with two men against a lone centre-forward, which would have the advantage of Alli and Jesse Lingard overmanning in transition against a single holding midfielder.That said, England do have the advantage of Kyle Walker, who plays at full-back for his club, playing on the right of the three central defenders, so if Trippier is caught upfield, he should be comfortable covering. And there is the possibility of using a Croatian strength against them if Trippier drives past Perisic, Ivan Strinic can be left isolated. (Fig 3) The situation is reminiscent of what happened when the sides met in Zagreb in September 2008 – there Rakitic was the attacking left-sided Croatian who left his full-back Danijel Pranjic exposed, leading to Theo Walcott’s only international hat-trick and a 4-1 England win.England have scored five of their 11 goals from set plays and two penalties have resulted from fouls on Harry Kane conceded in the mêlée England’s corner routine produces. The focus on corners has been Gareth Southgate’s indisputable triumph, a recognition of a way a national manager can make a tangible difference in the relatively short time available to him.A line of four players at the edge of the box, one of whom stands still as the ball is delivered while the others scatter, rather like a queue in a Tesco  suddenly realising additional checkouts are about to be opened. Not only does the static player plus his marker serve as a barrier to help create channels for Kane and Harry Maguire but the flurry of movement seems to provoke opponents into making panicky grabs at English shirts.Queueing while pointing out foreigners committing infractions of etiquette, of course, has been an English strength for years Southgate’s genius has been to weaponise it.Croatia will study England’s movement and have enough beefy defenders that they should not be physically intimidated, but then the same could have been said of Sweden, against whom Southgate deployed a variant with two queues of three players. There will surely be further routines waiting to be unveiled and England will have observed how poorly Croatia conceded the late corner against Russia that brought Mário Fernandes’s equaliser.Denmark, meanwhile, scored against them from a long throw into the box and Iceland’s Sverrir Ingi Ingason headed against the bar from a corner in the group stage.England’s prowess from set plays can also have knock-on benefits if defenders become so anxious at the prospect of conceding a set play that it makes them, in open play, reluctant to concede corners. A moment’s hesitation, or an over-ambitious attempt to play out from the back could present England with opportunities.Both England and Croatia needed penalties to progress from their last-16 ties, with Croatia then becoming only the second team in World Cup history to win multiple shootouts in the same tournament (either side in Croatia’s last-16 match would have matched the achievement of Argentina in 1990, as Russia had knocked Spain out via the same method in their previous game). Winning games on penalties, though, tends not to be a sign of long-term health. Excluding finals, there have been 28 penalty shootouts in World Cup history: only eight of the victors have gone on to win their next game within 120 minutes, and one of those was playing a side that had also progressed by means of penalties.Modric has looked in danger of resurrecting a World Cup tradition of the most technically gifted players failing from the spot (Socrates, Michel Platini, Dragan Stojkovic, Diego Maradona, Chris Waddle …). He saw his kick saved in extra time against Denmark and his two penalties in shootouts have both been unconvincing. His effort against Denmark was nervous, straight down the middle and only just avoided the trailing foot of the goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, while against Russia Igor Akinfeev reached a shot that was nowhere near the corner but was able only to push it on to the post from where it cannoned in. He is not a taker to be relied upon.Amid all the euphoria, it is perhaps worth remembering that the only teams England have actually beaten in this World Cup are Tunisia, Panama and Sweden. Although England’s defence coped well against Radamel Falcao, they were undone by Yerry Mina from that late Colombia corner.It is never wise to read too much into one moment in one game but, if that hinted at a vulnerability to an aerial threat at the back, it is one Croatia’s Mario Mandzukic is ideally suited to take advantage of. The 32-year-old Juventus forward has won 17 of the 30 aerial duels he has been involved in at this World Cup. Assuming he is fully fit – he limped through the final minutes of the quarter-final – he poses an aggressive and mobile threat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e92a54d7046be3e169ab13fcd9ecf0308af1e74/0_111_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7aab998193559d0b2a882be52fffecb2","title":"england holds its breath as world cup semi final looms","story":"Southgate’s men shoulder hopes of millions as they aim for first final since 1966Millions of expectant England fans will be glued to TV sets on Wednesday evening hoping the national team can reach the World Cup final for only the second time in their history.Pubs, bars, gardens and public parks are preparing to host parties, arranged around the semi-final match against Croatia, which kicks off at 7pm BST.About 30,000 people are expected in London’s Hyde Park alone, where a special screening has been organised. The nation has embraced Gareth Southgate’s young team for restoring pride with England’s best World Cup run since 1990. Before the second-round victory against Colombia, England had not won a knockout game at a major tournament since 2006, with the nadir arguably the defeat to Iceland at the European Championships just two years ago.But now the team stand just one match away from having the chance to emulate England’s World Cup-winning team of 1966.England mania has swept the country, with many TV presenters wearing waistcoats in homage to Southgate, who has maintained his immaculate appearance in the sweltering heat of Russia. With talk of England’s chances dominating conversations, even politicians and royalty have got in on the act. Prince William, the president of the FA, said: “A new generation is enjoying the magic of this World Cup run. The whole country is right behind you tonight. Come on England – it’s coming home!” His younger brother, Prince Harry, was asked whether “football was coming home” while visiting the Irish president, Michael Higgins. He laughed as he replied: “Most definitely.”Arriving at the Nato summit in Brussels, Theresa May said: “Good luck to the team tonight. I met the Croatian prime minister yesterday and we exchanged football shirts. “Gareth Southgate and the boys have done a fantastic job and I’m sure that they are going to go on to do well. I just wish them all the very best of luck tonight.”National Grid is braced for a 2,000MW-plus power surge – three times bigger than in England’s group games – as fans watching the game at home grab beers from the fridge and put on around 400,000 kettles to boil cups of tea.Power chiefs would monitor half-time and full-time surges “second by second” and if necessary flick the switch to turn on an instant power station in north Wales dubbed Electric Mountain, they said.England’s semi-final defeat to West Germany at the 1990 World Cup in Italy saw Britain’s record sudden power surge of 2,800MW.Moscow police estimate between 8,000 to 10,000 England fans may arrive in their city. Supporters who have arrived without tickets face a day of haggling with black marketeers and private sellers in order to get into the Luzhniki Stadium.Police chiefs have warned supporters in England against a repeat of the “significant disorder” that accompanied Saturday’s World Cup victory over Sweden. They said there were 387 mainly alcohol-related incidents across the country leading to 70 arrests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe231bcbb6adffa6166c137a91413b907aee2f2d/0_110_4394_2636/master/4394.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc98934223c99fa219c98c5db6031ccb","title":"google translate world cup hero fans language barriers","story":"Two couples are placed opposite each other at the one remaining table in a bar by the Volga. One is Russian and the other Brazilian it quickly turns out there is no common language but the semaphore for “anyone fancy a beer?” is universal enough and, besides, the football is on. They could probably get by for the evening on visual cues and repeat mentions of Harry Kane, but England v Colombia works better as background entertainment and the local man has an idea. Out comes a smartphone a few taps later and he is speaking slowly, clearly, into the mic: “How many games have you been to? I thought your team played well against Serbia.” The question is parroted back to his new friends, robotically and in correct Portuguese. Now the floodgates are open: by the time Eric Dier has scored the winning penalty, mother tongues have long since become irrelevant and the device is mediating plans for meet for more drinks the following day.It was Franz Kafka who said: “All language is but a poor translation” but perhaps he would have softened upon witnessing this scene and the thousands of similar iterations that have pulled visitors through good, bad and sometimes cringeworthy situations in Russia this summer. This has been a World Cup of shocks, set-pieces and VAR it has also been the World Cup of Google Translate, the technology coming into its own during a month of frenzied cross-cultural exchange in places where multilingualism is not always common. A South Korean needs to extend his stay in Kazan for another night? Tell it to the phone. A waitress has no khachapuri left to serve a table of hungry Costa Ricans in Samara? Let the medium become the message.Technology is yet to gain perfect mastery of nuance or vernacular so there has, perhaps refreshingly, been a healthy pile of unintended misunderstandings, insults and double entendres. One colleague, having used Google Translate to negotiate a competitive taxi rate in Volgograd, was wrong-footed when the driver offered: “If you would like a blow, it could be less.” He was proposing to turn the air conditioning down. Another, red-faced and puffing after an early-morning run in oppressive midsummer heat, was abashed to be confronted by a soldier who – using the text-based version of the service – flashed the question “Do you require medical attention?” on his screen.It might be enough to leave you pining for the days of the Berlitz phrasebook and the set of stock phrases studiously learned on the flight over. A significant reason for Google Translate’s primacy, though, is that the Cyrillic alphabet presents a hurdle before anyone has even started on vocabulary. In fact it can be picked up very quickly but that is easy to say when most football fans are around for a good time rather than a long time. Besides, there is an app for that too a number of supporters and media have fried each other’s brains with programmes that use a phone’s camera to instantly change the Russian text on, say, a cereal packet to English.These are loftier concerns than those held by a group of Uruguay fans wanting to hire a minibus to Nizhny Novgorod, or by many of the England supporters who have found that theirs is not the default “international” language in most of Russia’s provincial cities. If the pace of technological change can be dizzying then nobody who has seen it at first hand since early June can say it has been used for anything but good. A country whose mystique is sometimes exaggerated has, with the assistance of Google and its “neural machine translation” technology, been stripped back for all to enjoy. And, perhaps most remarkably of all, as the beer flowed during that impromptu meeting in Samara, it helped four people turn an England penalty shootout into a relaxed and enjoyable social occasion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b38260371ce26376b4aa6007608aee8f1b8e79e/0_257_4742_2845/master/4742.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3591f71a43c6f73b367acfdf499aed","title":"liverpool confident of signing swiss world cup hero stoke xherdan shaqiri","story":"Liverpool are confident of making Xherdan Shaqiri their third summer signing after opening transfer talks with Stoke City over the Switzerland international.Jürgen Klopp is keen to add the 26-year-old to his attacking options for next season and the winger wants to remain in the Premier League following Stoke’s relegation to the Championship.

The huge weight of English footballing culture makes it difficult for their style to change overnight and acquire a levity that would allow it to take flight – as if somewhere in the footballing instinct of these players with a fresh talent and an indisputable commitment to a new idea there is still something rigid that refuses to die. In order for this new style, played along the floor, to grow and spread like ivy, covering everything and taking root, collective intelligence is necessary.An intelligence that, for example, ensures the best player in the team – in England’s case, Harry Kane – is involved as often as his quality demands. If the best player does not come into contact with the game sufficiently for the opposition to feel intimidated and his own team to grow, there is something wrong either with the player (I don’t think so) or with the team.It seems to me England are attempting to make that happen the right way, that they are heading in the right direction. To judge by the results, they are succeeding, although Gareth Southgate has said this is a process that is still not complete and I would agree. I understand there is always a risk implicit in contradicting results – which are God these days – but I feel like that attempt still feels a little forced it doesn’t feel entirely natural.What do I mean by natural? It’s hard to explain but easy to see: look at Luka Modric, the greatest threat to England, and you will understand. He’s prodigious playing this game – and, so they tell me, every other game too – as if he was born with some muscular intelligence applicable to any activity expressed through a ball. Modric honours that natural advantage by playing with passion, enjoying what he does. He kills himself out there and yet for a superior talent like him, that does not count as sacrifice or suffering. Maybe we can call it a challenge, a test, a very particular type of fun.We’re not talking about a gift like Diego Maradona’s, rather one that consists filling the game with common sense. He doesn’t do impossible things when he plays a pass, you see it and think: ‘That’s what I would have done.’ We love to draw conclusions like that when we watch games but we should not believe what we say. In fact, what Modric does only Modric does.When the ball passes by his feet, the play flows as if football was the easiest thing in the world. It’s not about adding intensity or danger to the move it’s about adding sense, clarity, intent. At a World Cup at which it seems like spaces are disappearing – which is strange, considering the pitch still measures 100 x 70 – and everyone who gets the ball seems to be in a hurry, as if the entire pitch was penalty area, Modric performs the miracle of allowing the move to breathe, giving the ball the necessary speed, wherever it is on the field. Suddenly, we discover space and time do exist and that all that was needed was someone with the talent to bring them back, to make them what they always were. Someone who knows how to play football. Or better still, PLAY FOOTBALL in capital letters.The other characteristic the Croat has that doesn’t just convince me but fills me with emotion is his commitment to the game when his team have the ball and also when they lose it – from the first minute to the last. Against Russia, he won possession 15 times. In Sochi he struggled to find the game’s pulse, its rhythm, but as it went on, he came to understand what the game needed to the point at which he took control, running it.At the end of extra time, frustrated in his last attempt to attack Russia’s castle, fortified and so well defended, he fell to his knees exhausted. I could have cast a mould of him right there, producing a statue in honour of an exemplary, model footballer to be erected at every pitch everywhere in the world with a simple quote: “This is how you play football, this is how you feel football.”And to complete the admiration, we should talk, too, of a kind of competitive maturity I wouldn’t say has been lost exactly but I do think has been forgotten amid the importance we seem to place on players who over-act. Modric is everywhere, he wants every ball, he runs as much as a responsible understanding of the game allows, but he never allows himself a single act of demagoguery. As if he believed the 80,000 spectators in the ground were intelligent enough to appreciate dignity. Or, better still, as if they didn’t exist. He does not feel the pull of populism, nor any temptation to play to the gallery. He is too focused on football, submitting his five senses to the game itself.As intelligence – both muscular intelligence and intelligence as we have always understood it – is not so visible to the average fan, and as discretion has little market value, Modric will not win the Ballon d’Or, just as Andrés Iniesta did not win it in the generation before him. But that’s not his responsibility that’s the responsibility of all of us who have turned football into a world where appearance is more powerful than substance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f0b34451486dec71bacee0433c8b14897fd9f4/0_141_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7394f67f58b64286e9a6dfcb16cc291","title":"france into the final as destiny calls for england world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0ebdc58c2cdac6f834b29060181e4f821c6298/0_262_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a662485af14e91c6102f6d763d78e931","title":"world cup 2018 france into the final plus croatia v england buildup live","story":"Lurking outside the team hotel, Zlatko Dalic, the Croatia manager, says he is “always optimistic” before the big one. As for Stipe Pletikosa, the former Croatia No 1 once of Tottenham Hotspur in 2010, he’s been talking up both sides. “They are really young, they really know how to attack opponents but we have experienced players who know how to deal with this situation, and that is a big plus for us today,” he says. “Rakitic, Modric, Mandzukic have huge experience at the highest level.”More on our big-time loser list from a little earlier. “It was actually even worse for the three Leverkusen guys, Schneider, Ramelow and Neuville, in 2002,” emails Christoph Hintermeier, all the way from Berlin, “because they not only came second in the World Cup and Champions League finals, but also lost the German Cup final to Schalke and lost the German league championship to Dortmund on the last day of the season after being at the top for most of 2001-2002. So they lost four major titles in the space of almost two months and Leverkusen cemented its Vizekusen stigma as the club who always comes second.” A reminder of our list:• Thierry Henry (Arsenal and France 2006)• Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner (West Germany and Bayern Munich 1982)• Arjen Robben and Mark van Bommel (Bayern Munich and Netherlands 2010)• Nils Liedholm (Milan and Sweden 1958)• Carsten Ramelow, Bernd Schneider and Oliver Neuville (Bayer Leverkusen and Germany 2002)The PA system at the Luzhniki is currently blaring out Three Lions, presumably as some sort of practice in the event of another thumping header from ‘Slab Head’, Harry Maguire:Between 8,000-10,000 England supporters – many of whom have broken the bank – are en route to Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. Some are already in situ, some are still flocking towards the Russian capital. Supporters who have arrived without tickets face a day of haggling with black marketeers and private sellers in order to get in. Back home, the National Grid is braced for a 2,000MW-plus power surge – three times bigger than in England’s group games – as fans watching the game at home grab beers from the fridge and put on around 400,000 kettles to boil cups of tea.The last time England played Croatia, contrary to popular belief, things turned out pretty well. Fabio Capello’s team, fit with Matt Upson in defence, Rob Green in goal and a strike-force led by a front two of Emile Heskey and Wayne Rooney, ran out emphatic 5-1 winners at Wembley in September 2009. Before that, not so good:Steven Gerrard, the former England captain, has weighed in with his two-pennies’ worth on whether it’s coming home, and Ewan Murray was listening in on what the Rangers manager had to say:I fancy England, I must say,” Gerrard admitted. “I think they have handled every barrier or hurdle thrown at them in this World Cup and seem to be getting over them very well. “Croatia are a fantastic team. I think they actually possess the best midfielder in the world in the moment in Luka Modric. So it will certainly be a test, and the biggest test so far, but I just think there is a snowball effect and a feel-good factor that Gareth has continued to roll in a very impressive way. I think England will take some stopping.”Pressed on what Southgate has done differently to his immediate predecessors, Gerrard initially smiled. “I think he has picked his penalty takers pretty well! No, let’s be honest, England have done great to be where they are but the biggest test is about to come tonight, with all due respect to Colombia and Sweden. “England have had, not an easy ride but a comfortable ride, let’s say. I think they will have to be the real deal tonight so we will find out if they are potential winners tonight. It will be very tough to go on and win the tournament with France in the final, but tonight we will find out if they are the real deal.”Jordan Henderson is fit to start, should Gareth Southgate stick with the same XI that toppled Sweden in the quarter-finals, as expected. Henderson excelled in that match, but faces arguably his biggest test in stifling the Modric-Rakitic axis in Moscow this evening. And his club manager, Jürgen Klopp, admits he is happy the Liverpool man is finally getting some recognition. “I think there’s a lot more to come but finally they see Jordan Henderson,” Klopp said. “Somebody needs to do the work in the midfield, like Hendo, for example. He is not only a workhorse but a really good footballer as well. So, I’m happy for him now that he gets at least a little bit of the light and it is very well deserved.”Who’s the man in the middle tonight? Cuneyt Cakir. Not that it means anything ... but, the Turkish referee has taken charge of five previous England games and has never overseen an England defeat, the most recent at Wembley, a 3-0 win over Scotland in 2016 – a game that Southgate was still in interim charge for and Kyle Walker, John Stones, Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling all started. He also refereed the Champions League final in 2015.It seems an apt time get a little fuzzy and nostalgic. And this hastily-created XI – with a belting midfield of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Sir Bobby Charlton – is the closest thing to Gareth Southgate’s beloved – and so far brilliant – 3-5-2 system:You can create your own here – or peruse Viv Anderson’s picks:His performance against Spain in that opening round of matches – so long ago now – was nothing short of stunning, and the purring Portuguese has since moved on to pastures new with Juventus. But, in Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid are losing more than just four-hundred-and-fifty-one goals (44 of which were hat-tricks):Away from the usual suspects, Andrej Kramaric has had a really impressive tournament. He endured a forgettable stint at Leicester after a £9m move, but has been one of Croatia’s most dangerous players going forward, as our player ratings suggest here:More red-hot supermarket news: further to Aldi, Iceland and Lidl pledging to shut up shop early should England reach Sunday’s final, unions and politicians are calling for a bank holiday in the event of it coming home, so to speak. The Trades Union Congress general secretary, Frances O’Grady, thinks a first World Cup win since 1966 merits a national holiday. “We have fewer bank holidays than most of Europe,” she said. “Giving people a day off to celebrate the World Cup would be great for the country and isn’t going to crash the economy. Workers put in billions worth of unpaid overtime each year. They should be allowed to enjoy special occasions.”Even more on that Jagger Jinx. “In 1990 I went to see the Rolling Stones at Wembley on the night that England played West Germany in the semi-final,” begins Josh Mandel. “Fortunately there was a guy standing near us with a mini-telly, so we kept tabs on the game. At the end of extra time Jagger left the stage for ten minutes, leaving Keith to sing lead vocals on a couple of songs before Jagger came back on. They’d already done “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”, but they did finish the night with “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction”, which seemed appropriate.” I’d argue that Rob Smyth knows more about Italia 90 than most of the footballers who played in it. And he wrote a lovely piece for The Blizzard in 2014 about the long-term impact that England’s penalty shootout defeat by West Germany in the World Cup semi-final had on English football. There are some lovely nuggets in there, not least this one that may come to mind tonight if the game goes to penalties.The demand for electricity just after Waddle’s kick against West Germany was the highest for six years, since the final episode of The Thorn Birds.” You can read his wonderful piece here and then Ben Fisher will take over to bring you all the buildup as England’s Class of 2018 attempt to go one further than Bobby Robson’s boys. Bye. Our graphics team have been working furiously throughout the World Cup to bring you more stats, charts and graphs than you would find in a maths textbook. Here is how Croatia and England compare for shots and goals in each match throughout the tournament right up to tonight’s semi-final.And here’s our ongoing graphical interpretation of Russia 2018, where every game and goal is presented in snazzy fashion as a treat for your peepers.And did you know there was another major match going on as I type that involves England? Here’s Tanya Aldred to tell you all about it.Apparently, there’s a game on tonight and some grown men still can’t think of dressing up as anything other than 12th-15th century knights of the realm to display their Englishness.Meanwhile, away from the World Cup, here’s a bit of Chelsea-related news:An update on our big-time loser list. Michael Ballack, who lost the European Cup final with Leverkusen in 2002, was suspended for the World Cup final that year so did not play. So he’s been scratched off. However, we now have Ballack’s teammates Carsten Ramelow, Bernd Schneider and Oliver Neuville to add. So the list reads:Thierry Henry (Arsenal and France 2006)Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner (West Germany and Bayern Munich 1982)Arjen Robben and Mark van Bommel (Bayern Munich and Netherlands 2010)Nils Liedholm (Milan and Sweden 1958)Carsetn Ramelow, Bernd Schneider and Oliver Neuville (Bayer Leverkusen and Germany 2002)So Alexander-Arnold, Henderson and Lovren will be hoping to avoid joining this group if they get to the final. What time is it? It’s World Cup Fiver O’Clock! Here’s Paul Doyle on whether football or flipall is coming home.I wonder if the Jagger Jinx expands beyond football. If you saw him, say, when you were about to do a bungee jump, should you immediately check on your life insurance policy? All this talk of the Jagger Jinx can’t be good for Rolling Stones ticket sales. Paul Pogba has dedicated France’s 1-0 semi-final win over Belgium to the 12 Thai boys who were rescued from a flooded cave along with their coach on Tuesday. “This victory goes to the heroes of the day, well done boys, you are so strong,” Pogba said after Samuel Umtiti’s headed goal put France in Sunday’s World Cup final in Moscow, where they will play Croatia or England.On Wednesday, La Liga said they had invited the boys and their coach to Spain to attend a Spanish top flight game in the future when they have fully recovered from the ordeal. La Liga’s president Javier Tebas said: “When the moment is right and everyone is ready I would like to invite the children and their coach to go to a Liga game. We would like to host them and share with them the happiness of football, hoping that this can go some way to helping them after everything they’ve been through in the last few weeks.” Fifa had invited the boys to Sunday’s World Cup final although the world organising body said that due to medical reasons the boys would not be in a position to travel to the game, although they would invite them to an event in the future.I think we’ve hit peak ‘It’s Coming Home’:Kira Nelson can’t help but get ahead of herself: “If England do potentially reach the final, what sort of game plan would we have against France? I see Trippier’s crosses as a big factor. Had Nacer Chadli provided some better balls into the box last night the outcome of the match may have been very different, as it seemed this was the only time France’s defence seemed in any way vulnerable. Trying to play through France in my opinion would be a terrible idea, and on the break Mbappe is a fearsome prospect. Get the ball out wide as often as possible to Trippier and Young to whip them in, stop passes into Mbappe and we may have a chance. Assuming we can get past Croatia and the magician that is Luka Modric.”Some more lunchtime reading … and quizzing:If you’ve enjoyed reading Jorge Valdano, Barney Ronay, Marcel Desailly, Thomas Hitzlsperger and the rest of our World Cup team’s coverage of the tournament so far, then you can help to support us and ensure we can continue to cover future tournaments so comprehensively in the future by becoming a  member. Our senior sports writer, Barney Ronay, explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in play.An answer to Rosa O’Rourke’s question about the shape of the blob flags before games in Russia. The UK is now the most obese nation in Western Europe. Twenty-eight per cent of children between two and 15 are overweight – and Barney Ronay believes England’s run at the World Cup should be used for the greater good and inspire youngsters at grassroots level to be healthier in a way that the Olympics failed to do. “My family have been debating a very important question all tournament - during the anthems, what shape are the weird flag blobs meant to be? Our guesses have included hearts, tears, and a location pin like on google maps, but we can’t find the answer anywhere! Can the famous  investigative journalism help us settle this argument?” asks Rosa O’Rourke. I would love to be able to tell you Rosa, but our investigative journalist David Conn is busy. So I’ll plump for teardrops, because football makes us all cry a little, even if it’s just inside.Ralph Brown has been busy pulling apart the lyrics to Three Lions to give us a glimpse into the glass-half-empty English psyche. Superstitions eh? I suspect James Walsh won’t be the only England fan avoiding walking under ladders, blanking a black cat or swerving cracks in the pavement today: “I am struggling with my own Jagger’s jinx for tonight. A friend has invited me over to watch the match, but it is well known that the specific combination of me in that guy’s house ends in embarrassing English defeat regardless of format or feasibility – a record dating back to the 2007 cricket World Cup, despite the best efforts of future PM Ravinder Bopara. He has admittedly since moved down the road, but the one match of this World Cup I’ve seen at his new place was … Belgium 1-0 England. Should I just lock myself in the shed?” Maybe, but perhaps take a bucket.Croatia have another stellar midfielder you know – and David Hytner has written this lovely piece about the man who is happy to be put on the spot.The pressure is intense, never more than on that walk from the halfway line when teammates are begging you to please, please, please score and every step seems an eternity. Yet, on the outside at least, he walked calmly into the next round, taking Croatia with him, making history. It is more than penalties too, there is something in that idea that defines him well beyond the spot, the safety in knowing he is there, when needed and what is needed.An intriguing battle in tonight’s game will be that between Harry Kane and Dejan Lovren, who had a nightmare against Tottenham last October and was hauled off after 31 minutes of Liverpool’s 4-1 defeat. In Croatia’s press conference he was asked whether this game would be on his mind, and was a little bit miffed. I don’t know what to say in response to this question. It’s completely irrelevant, that 4-1 defeat. Why didn’t you ask me how I played well against him in other games? You’re just nit-picking in terms of my performances.To be fair to Lovren, he has recovered remarkably well since that low point, having got over a debilitating back injury and then benefited from having Virgil van Dijk as his partner in central defence at Liverpool. He played brilliantly in the Champions League games and appears so much more assured now. Croatia’s best chance of upsetting Lovren could be if Kane drops deep and pulls him out of position. Prhaps then Raheem Sterling or Dele Alli could find space in behind. The state of the world right here, summed up by corporate banter between the public transport authorities of Paris and Brussels. Here’s the story via Reuters: Brussels commuters, heading to work the morning after Belgium’s painful World Cup loss to France, had to endure the French soccer anthem piped through the city’s metro on Wednesday.The reason: not only did the national team lose 1-0 in Tuesday’s semi-final but also the Brussels public transport authority lost a bet with its Parisian counterpart. Before the match, the two groups challenged each other on social media. If Belgium won, Paris would change signs at its Saint-Lazare station to “Saint Hazard” in honour of Belgian whirlwind midfielder Eden Hazard. But after the “Golden Generation’s” defeat in St Petersburg, Brussels instead had to “treat” travellers to the anthem “Tous Ensemble” -All together - by late French rocker Johnny Hallyday at 8 and 10 am. At least Hallyday’s father was a Belgian. The country honoured the singer’s heritage when he died last year, playing his greatest hits on trains and over loudspeakers on the Grand Place in central Brussels.I asked you which other players have lost a European Cup final and World Cup final in the same year and you didn’t disappoint. The sorry list of big time double-losers is:Thierry Henry (Arsenal and France 2006)Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner (West Germany and Bayern Munich 1982)Arjen Robben and Mark van Bommel (Bayern Munich and Netherlands 2010)Nils Liedholm (Milan and Sweden 1958)“Nils Liedholm managed to do the unwanted double of losing the European Cup final and the World Cup final in the same year at the earliest opportunity. In May 1958, he captained Milan to a 3-2 defeat against the great Real Madrid team of Di Stefano and Kopa, after being 1-0 and 2-1 up - just over a month later, he opened the scoring for Sweden against Brazil, only to lose 5-2 to Pele and Garrincha’s mob,” writes Phili Laing.If you want to know if what the longest assist in World Cup history is then today’s edition of The Knowledge is required reading. It also reveals who the lowest-ranked English-based World Cup 2018 player is while Rob Smyth busts the Italia 90 Dave Beasant myth.Now you might think Jordan Henderson’s ability to nullify Luka Modric, Kieran Trippier’s explosive runs from right wing-back or Dele Alli’s knack of arriving in the box with impeccable timing might determine whether England make it to the World Cup final by beating Cratia tonight. But we all know it will come down to the Jagger Jinx. If the Rolling Stones frontman turns up in Moscow tonight, England are doomed. He did for Belgium’s hopes last night and he did for Brazil’s in 2014 too. Poor Mick’s even be blamed for obliterating Australia’s hopes of winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup because his former partner, Jerry Hall, turned up at that one. Here’s a piece from 2014 explaining the Jagger Jinx.And having looked at the shimmering list of players who have won the World Cup and European Cup in the same year, what about those who have lost a European Cup final and World Cup final within the space of a couple of months.The only one I can recall is Michael Ballack, who lost the European Cup final with Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 and then went on to lose the World Cup final with Germany when Ronaldo tore them apart for Brazil. Players who could get to experience that acute misery on Sunday are England’s Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jordan Henderson, or Croatia’s Dejan Lovren, all of whom experienced defeat for Liverpool against Real Madrid in Kiev. Any more to join Ballack? Let me know. Stat time! If Raphael Varane goes on to win the World Cup he will join an exclusive group of players who have won the European Cup and World Cup in the same year. There are 10 at the moment. Here they are:Uli Hoeness, Gerd Müller, Franz Beckenbauer, Paul Breitner, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Sepp Maier and Jupp Kapellmann (Bayern Munich and Germany 1974)Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid and France 1998 ), Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid and Brazil 2002) and Sami Khedira (Real Madrid and Germany 2014)Sachin Nakrani has been busy crunching the numbers at  Towers to work out just where England rank in this World Cup. One of the best stats in this piece is not even England-related. It shows that Spain players still boss the passes completed section thanks to shuffling a million passes sideways and backwards in the last 16 against Russia.Amar Breckenridge believes a Belgian coach’s influence on Didier Deschamps might explain why the France team are playing such functional but successful football in Russia. “Didier Deschamps’s major achievements in France were winning the inaugural Champions League with Marseille in 1993 ( the first and only time a French club has won the title) and the World Cup in 1998 and Euros in 2000. All these were won on the back of iron discipline. In Marseille’s case that was masterminded by Belgian coach Raymond Goethals - nicknamed ‘La Science’ - and it’s hard not to see the late Goethal’s influence last night against, ironically, his homeland. And for all that we remember the exploits of Zinedine Zidane for France, the basis of France’s success was their defence – Blanc, Thuram, Lizarezu and Desailly, with Deschamps in front of them. France never lost when that back four played together. Given that background, Deschamps would never become the exponent of expansive play. Once derided by Eric Cantona as Zidane’s ‘water-carrier’, Deschamps is banking on his calculated approach to take France to a second title.”Jorge Valdano has penned some brilliant columns for the  during the World Cup and his latest, on Luka Modric, is another wonderful piece of writing, getting to the heart of what it is hat makes the Croatia captain so damn good at football. Here’s an extract: When the ball passes by his feet, the play flows as if football was the easiest thing in the world. It’s not about adding intensity or danger to the move it’s about adding sense, clarity, intent. At a World Cup at which it seems like spaces are disappearing – which is strange, considering the pitch still measures 100 x 70 – and everyone who gets the ball seems to be in a hurry, as if the entire pitch was penalty area, Modric performs the miracle of allowing the move to breathe, giving the ball the necessary speed, wherever it is on the field. Suddenly, we discover space and time do exist and that all that was needed was someone with the talent to bring them back, to make them what they always were. Someone who knows how to play football. Or better still, PLAY FOOTBALL in capital letters.More on the question of whether the FA has fixed English football. Here’s Luke Harrison: “I am with Chaps on this.... Somehow the FA has done something right with St George’s Park which does seem to be working. Evidenced by consensus on this article and by winning two (TWO!!!) youth World Cups last year. I agree that the appointment of Southgate was accidentally visionary but I think the future of English football is bright. So much so that I am almost hoping we don’t win this world cup so we can really win it in style in four or eight years time. Having said that, my confidence in the FA is such that I would not be surprised if they find a way to mess the whole thing up.”I’d agree that the youth World Cup wins are a huge indicator of progress being made in English football development. There is still the thorny issue of whether those players who have done so well at development level can break into their respective club sides’ first teams, though. That Trent Alexander-Arnold has done so well at Liverpool is a good sign but if a player such as Phil Foden, who appears to be an incredible talent, can somehow become a Manchester City first-team regular, then the prospects are good. His career could still stall, though. Look at Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who can’t break into the team at Chelsea despite a couple of seasons knocking on the door. The Premier League could still ruin all the FA’s good work. Good old Premier League.A bit of World Cup-related transfer news now. Liverpool are hopeful of wrapping up a £13m deal for Stoke and Switzerland’s Xherdan Shaqiri, aka the Powercube, before Jürgen Klopp heads off to the United States with his Liverpool squad on 22 July for a pre-season tour.

The only difference from the avocados you know? These ones are about the size of your head.The Avozilla, as it has been dubbed, has arrived in Australia. Weighing an average of 1.2kg, the fruits are about four times the size of regular avocados and are expected to sell for $12 each. “There’s certainly a shock factor when you pick one up and they’re as big as your head,” farmer Ian Groves told  Australia. Originating from South Africa, the Avozilla reached Britain in 2013. But the Groves family, which has grown tropical and exotic fruits in central Queensland since 1957, are the first to bring the variety to Australia. Groves said the fruit tasted similar to their regular-sized equivalent but were slightly softer to spread. “I love them. We eat them at home all the time,” he said. Groves said the first harvest was being sent to grocers in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. “There is a nursery we buy different trees off and when we were planting a bunch of avocados 10 years ago they gave us one as a trial,” he said. “And after about four or five years, we tried a few of the fruit and thought we’d give them a go. So we planted a small block of about just under 400 trees. They’re coming up to about four years and this is their first production.”Though they would be perfect for the increasing number of cafes and restaurants serving up hundreds of plates of smashed avo on toast each day, Groves predicted the variety was likely to remain a novelty because the trees were “light producers”. The family are likely to be the only growers of the novelty fruit for some time, having got in years before their competition. Farms cannot plant the variety without gaining permission and paying royalties to the South African company that owns the rights. “A friend of ours is planting 2000 trees in Bundaberg probably this year,” Groves said. “So we’re four years ahead of him. But I don’t know if growers will jump on board, they are such niche market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11c1e4d9f82bd81ef2e1ac6fd0790379b8cc4b76/0_513_2742_1645/master/2742.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ad3e8b34485c33529a60084ee7680dc","title":"liam charles cake best way to make people happy","story":"He likes buttercream so much he once wrote an ode to it – so what can the breakout star of last year’s competition teach us about sweet treats?“I love most types of food, but it’s my sweet tooth that makes me who I am.” Liam Charles was the youngest contestant on last year’s Great British Bake Off. At 20 years old, he went straight from the show to a ridiculously charming turn as a judge on Bake Off: The Professionals. It didn’t revolutionise the genre – same suspense-building piano music, used exclusively and perhaps invented for competitive cooking, same high tensions generated by the composition of an egg – but it did revolutionise the potential of that genre. Charles has a face of such open-hearted admiration that it takes you straight back to first principles: this isn’t a game! Some of this stuff is really delicious!He is now publishing Cheeky Treats, a gly, Technicolor, many-faceted recipe book, whose title completely underplays the intricacy of its ideas. It is distinguished not by the two kilos of icing sugar in the Football Cake (and that’s just the buttercream!), nor the very simple, incredibly effective, domino pattern on his salted millionaire dominoes, nor his vertiginous layering or moments of French patisserie perfectionism, but by the joie de vivre conveyed by all those things, and the rest. “I think I’m a nice person,” he says, in his publisher’s office in central London, “regardless of the cake. I don’t like upsetting people. I just like making people happy. I thought cake was the best way.” Here, then, are his top baking tips.By the age of 15, “I could do cupcakes, cakes to a certain standard, I dabbled in pastry and bread. I did biscuits from time to time. I was solid.” Already, Charles’s friends had christened him Cake Boy, a nickname that stuck throughout his time on Bake Off.Charles went on to study drama at Goldsmiths, University of London two years ago, and will graduate this coming winter. “Over that summer between school and uni, that’s when I developed the most. That’s when I started to do chocolate work, tier cakes. If you make a four-layer cake, there is some kind of drama, you’ve got all this buttercream, and you’re like: ‘What’s inside? What’s inside?’ So there’s suspense there. There are more similarities between baking and drama than people think.”I am sceptical about the suspense – you are more or less assured that, underneath the icing, there will be cake – but no one could deny the impact of, say, his chequer cake, regally tall and plush. To those mystified by how you could fit it in your mouth: “You’ve just got to pace yourself, and enjoy it.”Mother’s day 2016 and Charles wanted to spring some doughnuts on his mother. Although a kitchen enthusiast herself, they didn’t bake together throughout childhood. “I was fixated on cake, I treated everything like a cake,” he says. Without a deep-fat fryer or any experience of proving dough, failure – burnt on the outside, raw on the inside, the texture of a padded cell if you brought yourself to eat it – was inevitable. “I did think: ‘Shall I leave this? Maybe it’s not my thing’. But it’s not in me to do that, so I just finessed it and finessed it. And the day I just bagged it was an amazing experience. But it took me months.”Charles still lives with him mum and his sister, and has a brother, too. He mentions his dad in passing – he used to take him to play football on the other side of London – but is extremely reticent about his family. The most detail you’ll get is about how many burners the oven has (six). His mum, he says sphinxishly, works in an office. Is it a secret, what she does, or have you just not asked? He smiles: “It’s definitely an office.”Goldsmiths, says Charles, was a haven of enthusiasts: no such thing as too experimental, even if that meant taking on a life-consuming TV commitment partway through a term. “They were, like: ‘Do what you have to do, as long as you come back to uni.’” When he finished Bake Off, placing fifth, he returned with three weeks to do his third-year project, a monologue he’d written himself, called The Metaphorical Meanings of Buttercream. “If I was going to go the easy route, it would have been clowning, because I’m apparently a very animated person. But I thought: ‘No, let me just test myself and find a deeper meaning with this piece.’ Most of the time, I’m mad positive, and when you’re really positive and hyper, people think you don’t think about things. So when I did show that level of intelligence, they were like: ‘Woah, he is a deeper brother.’” This is a motto borrowed from one of Charles’s baking idols, Christina Tosi, the US baking entrepreneur behind Milk Bar, and star of a Netflix Chef’s Table. “Because she comes from such a humble background, and her baking is still so humble, she stays true to herself through baking even though she’s on this massive scale now. That’s why people watch other people cook the interplay between the character and what they’re making. When something goes wrong, or when something’s good, people watching it really feel it.”Bake Off had been Charles’s dream since school, but even when he applied and got through, he thought it was probably a trial run. “If you’re not surprised to get on, you’re not human. It’s an audition process, there are so many stages, I just kept thinking: ‘If I get to this stage, that’ll be cool, I’ll go back next year. Oh, I’m through to the next stage.’ I cherished every single moment.” During his time as a contestant, Charles insists he had no rivals, “no competitive beef with anyone in that tent”, his worst and only enemy being himself. “I always want to do well, and sometimes getting up in my own head could be to the detriment of that. So I was constantly thinking: ‘You can do this, so shut up.’”Charles’s baking life hasn’t been without its flaws: one time he made a custard tart in a too-hot oven, and ended up with a beautiful looking pastry shell full of scrambled egg. “I haven’t had any training in it. It’s like baking instinct. It’s like Messi and Ronaldo, that’s why they’re so clearly above everyone else. You can have training but you have to have that extra sauce or that extra belief in what you do. I’m not calling myself Messi, by the way.”Cheeky Treats: 70 Brilliant Bakes and Cakes by Liam Charles is out on 12 July, available for £17 at the  Bookshop.

I dream about those tacos.”As with all the best dishes, there’s some debate about its origins, with the city of Ensenada and the town of San Felipe both claiming paternity: the first credits Japanese migrants for the crispy, tempura-style fish, and the latter the local climate, which apparently is only tolerable on a regular diet of mustardy beer batter. One serves the fish in corn tortillas, the other in corn or wheat, one fries in oil, the other lard, one adds guacamole and ketchup – and that’s before you even get to the choice of fish or salad.Meghan herself favours a distinctly Californian-style grilled version with peppers and onions – and, 5,000 miles away, we’re even less bound by local loyalties. So, if you happen to find yourself stuck in a damp, grey city more into fish and chips than fish tacos, what’s the best way to make them at home?Unsurprisingly, the fish found in the ocean off Baja California bear scant resemblance to those in my local fishmongers. Mexican expert Rick Bayless says that “practically any” boneless skinless fish fillets will work (Markle enjoys salmon), but Bayless likes “larger-flake, lighter-flavor fish best”. His sea bass, J Kenji López-Alt’s hake and Rick Stein’s cod, from his book The Road to Mexico, are easy enough to source, but I use monkfish and stone bass in place of the more exotic mahi mahi and flounder. Hake and both varieties of bass prove a little soft for our liking, but monkfish and cod work brilliantly, being firm enough to hold their shape, and juicy enough to withstand the rigours of deep-frying: look for cod or similar white fish cheeks, which are not only a little cheaper than steaks, but are also already conveniently cut to size.Whatever fish you use, once it’s battered and deep-fried, it should begin to look a bit more familiar – unless you go down the American route. Sam Anguiano of LA’s Pink Taco rubs his fish with Old Bay seasoning and grills it over fresh mesquite for the “ultimate fresh flavour” – in the absence of mesquite, I go for a hot griddle pan. They’re delicious, as are Sam Sifton’s seasoned-flour versions, shallow fried in oil and butter, but texturally neither can compete with the crunch of hot batter: as López-Alt wisely observes, “if there’s any cooking method in the world that can make all foods taste great, it’s deep-frying”. (I don’t try frying them in lard, as I can’t get hold of any free-range stuff in time, but if you have a good extraction system, from my extensive experience with fish fried in beef dripping, I’d recommend it.) If you’d like a healthier version, then by all means grill them … but know you’ll be missing out.Although Stein is clearly a man who knows how to batter a fish (flour, salt, baking powder and ice-cold beer), his simple, rather British version can’t compete with the spicy tang of Bayless and López-Alt’s more highly seasoned recipes. Yellow mustard is apparently de rigeur in Baja California, but I can’t help thinking the more fiery English sort would be even better. López Alt adds paprika, and Sifton chilli powder, while Bayless goes for Mexican oregano and chicken stock, which gives his batter a wonderfully savoury flavour, although vegetable would do for pescatarians. Any extra chilli feels unnecessary given the accompaniments, and López-Alt’s egg and double flouring process gives his batter a crunchy, fried-chicken-like solidity which, while undoubtedly pleasing to eat, doesn’t prove quite as popular as Bayless and Stein’s lighter, crisper versions, possibly because they’re easier to overeat.You could just dollop on sour cream and chilli sauce and be done with it, but most of the recipes call for homemade “crema” made from a mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise, with Stein thinning it with lime juice and Bayless milk, while López-Alt sticks with mayonnaise mixed with sriracha, and Anguiano sour cream mixed with Louisiana hot sauce. I find the more liquid versions hard to keep in the taco, but López-Alt’s is a little too solid for me to drizzle. Souped-up sour cream with your own favourite brand of chilli-based condiment will do the job: although it’s a long way from home, López-Alt’s sriracha gives an addictively savoury flavour, and Stein and Sifton’s chipotle chillies in adobo sauce provide a more complex smokiness. Even good old Tabasco works in a pinch.Although salsa isn’t mandatory, it does give extra freshness to the dish, especially if, like Stein and Sifton, you make your own pico de gallo from tomatoes, onion, coriander and chilli, mixed with a generous amount of lime juice and salt. A salad of raw chopped cabbage is non-negotiable, however: we like the crunch of Stein’s white version, but red or green would do just as well. Anguiano also includes a cucumber slaw with red onion and serrano pepper dressed with orange, lemon and lime juice: nice on the side, but too wet for my liking in a taco.Faced with a dearth of decent fruit, López-Alt uses quick pickled red onions instead of the tomatoes he says are typically added to fish tacos in California for their “brightness and acidity”. Although we are now in peak tomato season, I’d urge you to make a batch of his onions anyway. They’re incredible. His avocados are another optional extra: you don’t need them, but I do like the creamy, squidgy texture they bring to the party – and if a taco isn’t too full to pick up, surely you’re not doing it right.You can use corn or flour – but I don’t know why you’d go for the latter when corn tortillas have so much more flavour. They’re still oddly hard to track down in this country, but if you don’t live near a stockist, then buy them online. They freeze very well, which means you’re only ever a few ingredients away from taco-based bliss: now with the seal of royal approval.4 ripe tomatoes½ small red onion1 jalapeño chilli1 small bunch corianderJuice of 1½ limes¼ tsp salt120ml sour cream2 tbsp chilli sauce, plus extra to serve½ white, green or red cabbage1 avocado, optional200g plain flour¼ tsp salt½ tsp baking powder1 tsp mustard powder1 tsp chicken or vegetable stock cube or powder300ml cold lagerNeutral oil, for frying8 corn tortillas400g cod cheeks, or other firm, white fish, cut into stripsDeseed and dice the tomatoes, and put in a bowl.

Winkleman is paid a fifth of the best-paid man, sports presenter Gary Lineker, who receives £1.75m. Winkleman ranks 13th in the top 20, with Feltz 15th equal.The BBC has increased transparency this year by narrowing the pay bands it reports from £50,000 to £10,000. The increase in the number of women making the list comes as big-name stars have agreed to significant pay cuts as the corporation looks to bridge the chasm in pay with female presenters.He was paid between £600,000 and £650,000. This has now been reduced to between £400,000 to £410,000, with the BBC saying that next year it will fall to “below” £300,000.Radio 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell will see his pay drop from £410,000 to £420,000 to “below” £350,000 by next March, with a further cut after that. And the remuneration of BBC News presenter Huw Edwards, whose pay was between £550,000 and £559,000, will fall to “well below” £500,000 by next year and “continue to fall”.Overall the BBC spent almost £19m on its 64 best-paid on-air stars.The efforts to close the gender pay gap at the BBC will result in the total number of on-air talent paid more than £150,000 rising by almost a fifth from 58 to 69 by 1 April 2019.Despite the progress, critics argue that the BBC has, if anything, become less transparent since spinning off its TV production arm, which makes shows from EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing, and merging it with BBC Worldwide.A string of top earners including BBC One Show presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones (the second best-paid female BBC star), DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and Strictly’s Tess Daly have disappeared from the list. This is because programmes they were paid for are now produced by the newly merged entity, BBC Studios. It is classed as a commercial entity and does not publish how much it pays people.As a result, while last year’s list of the BBC’s top-paid stars featured 96 names, this year that number has shrunk to 69. In addition, some of the stars who have seen large reductions in pay from the BBC have had part of their salary only appear to be reduced – Humphrys’ job fronting Mastermind is now paid by BBC Studios, for instance, and so is not disclosed.Hall said excluding BBC Studios pay figures has done the corporation “no favours” as it actually reduced the number of women, and higher-earning women, in the list, and that including them would have improved its gender and salary mix.“We are not hiding anything,” said Hall. “Our public service side is going to degrees of transparency we have never gone before.”The BBC’s list also only counts remuneration directly paid from the BBC licence fee. This means it does not include payments to staff through independent production companies that make programmes for the BBC, or payments from BBC Worldwide.As a result, the list still does not include stars such as Sherlock’s Benedict Cumberbatch, Question Time’s David Dimbleby, Have I Got News For You’s Ian Hislop, Sir David Attenborough or Alan Sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted.

All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Emma’s Diary can make representations to the ICO to reduce the fine before it makes a final decision on the matter.The company describes itself as “one of the UK’s leading baby clubs for mums-to-be, providing expert advice on every aspect of pregnancy and childcare” and claims to be “the most widely circulated mother-and-baby publication”, distributing 870,000 copies each year.It works with organisations including the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Midwives to reach new and expectant mothers. In exchange for registering with the company, mothers receive Argos vouchers and various free gifts as well as information throughout pregnancy.On Tuesday, the deputy information commissioner, Steve Wood, said the ICO had “really significant concerns about how Emma’s Diary was gathering the data, particularly involving mothers who were in hospital”.In May 2017, one month ahead of the general election, Emma’s Diary – the trading name of Lifecycle Marketing (Mother and Baby) Ltd – provided more than 1m records to the data broking firm Experian, according to the ICO’s notice.For each of the records Emma’s Diary supplied the mother’s name, her address, the date of birth of the mother and child, and how many children under five were present in the home. Experian then loaded the records into a database for the Labour party to use in a direct marketing mail campaign for the 2017 general election. The information was used in the constituencies for 106 parliamentary seats, according to the ICO notice.Experian deleted the records following the 2017 general election. There is no suggestion of any breach of data protection legislation by Experian or the Labour party.Emma’s Diary told the ICO that usage of mothers’ data was fully outlined in its privacy policy at the time. However, the ICO disagreed on the basis that the privacy policy contained no mention of selling data for political purposes.The company later amended its privacy policy to make explicit the potential for customer data to be sold for political purposes, according to the ICO notice.The ICO said the disclosure “risked causing distress to some affected data subjects”, and that any of the mothers could “reasonably infer that the Labour party was subjecting her to a degree of profiling for political ends and without her knowledge”.The commission also found that it was highly likely that affected iniduals would be distressed that their children’s personal data had been fed into a party political database without their consent.In mitigation the ICO said this was the first time Emma’s Diary had shared data with any political party and that the fine would likely have a financial and reputational impact on the company.Publication of the notice follows the announcement yesterday that the ICO intended to fine Facebook £500,000 for its part in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.That fine, the largest possible under old legislation, is one of a series of enforcement actions the organisation has taken after it launched an investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes.The inquiry, launched in March 2017 following reporting in the Observer on Cambridge Analytica, has since evolved into the ICO’s largest ever investigation, with as many as 40 full-time staff. In addition to the Facebook fine and enforcement action against Cambridge Analytica, the ICO announced that it would conduct an audit of UK political parties’ data processing practices.The Labour party said it welcomed the ICO’s report and said it held data from a variety of sources.“We have neither bought nor used Emma’s Diary data since the 2017 general election and we will be reviewing our approach to acquiring data from third parties in light of the ICO’s report,” a spokesperson said.Concerns have previously been raised over how the personal data of new and expectant mothers is being obtained. Five years ago 60,000 people signed a petition calling for the government to sever a contract with Bounty over sales representatives obtaining details from women in hospital. In a statement Lifecycle Marketing said it disputed the ICO’s findings. “Lifecycle Marketing has been operating for more than 25 years with integrity,” it said. “We have always sought to fully comply with our data protection obligations, which we take extremely seriously.”It went on: “We are deeply disappointed by the ICO’s decision to publish a report including details of enforcement action intended to be taken against Lifecycle Marketing. The company said it was not given an opportunity to respond to detail of the ICO’s notice. “We look forward to working with the ICO on its ongoing investigation and will be submitting our written representations to challenge the ICO’s findings in accordance with the usual process,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/570b3d1c966e542856c5ba98aef2a73c12ccabea/0_316_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f447a1d5cf0faafb01bb59e36d85bbfd","title":"no single birthplace of mankind say scientists","story":"Researchers say it is time to drop the idea that modern humans originated from a single population in a single location The origins of our species have long been traced to east Africa, where the world’s oldest undisputed Homo sapiens fossils were discovered. About 300,000 years ago, the story went, a group of primitive humans there underwent a series of genetic and cultural shifts that set them on a unique evolutionary path that resulted in everyone alive today.However, a team of prominent scientists is now calling for a rewriting of this traditional narrative, based on a comprehensive survey of fossil, archaeological and genetic evidence. Instead, the international team argue, the distinctive features that make us human emerged mosaic-like across different populations ning the entire African continent. Only after tens or hundreds of thousands of years of interbreeding and cultural exchange between these semi-isolated groups, did the fully fledged modern human come into being.Dr Eleanor Scerri, an archaeologist at Oxford University, who led the international research, said: “This single origin, single population view has stuck in people’s mind … but the way we’ve been thinking about it is too simplistic.”This continental-wide view would help reconcile contradictory interpretations of early Homo sapiens fossils varying greatly in shape, scattered from South Africa (Florisbad) to Ethiopia (Omo Kibish) to Morocco (Jebel Irhoud). The telltale characteristics of a modern human – globular brain case, a chin, a more delicate brow and a small face – seem to first appear in different places at different times. Previously, this has either been explained as evidence of a single, large population trekking around the continent en masse or by dismissing certain fossils as side-branches of the modern human lineage that just happened to have developed certain anatomical similarities.The latest analysis suggests that this patchwork emergence of human traits can be explained by the existence of multiple populations that were periodically separated for millennia by rivers, deserts, forests and mountains before coming into contact again due to shifts in the climate. “These barriers created migration and contact opportunities for groups that may previously have been separated, and later fluctuation might have meant populations that mixed for a short while became isolated again,” said Scerri.The trend towards more sophisticated stone tools, jewellery and cooking implements also supports the theory, according to the paper in the journal Trends in Ecology \u0026amp Evolution.Scerri assembled a multidisciplinary group to examine the archaeological, fossil, genetic and climate data together, with the aim of eliminating biases and assumptions. Previously, she said, scientific objectivity had been clouded by fierce competition between research groups each wanting their own discoveries to be given a prominent place on a linear evolutionary ladder leading to the present day. Disputes between rival teams working in South Africa and east Africa had become entrenched, she said.“Someone finds a skull somewhere and that’s the source of humanity. Someone finds some tools somewhere, that’s the source of humanity,” she said, describing the latest approach as: “‘Let’s be inclusive and construct a model based on all the data we have available.”The analysis also paints a picture of humans as a far more erse collection of species and sub-populations than exists today. Between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago, our own ancestors lived alongside a primitive human species called Homo naledi, found in southern Africa, a larger brained species called Homo heidelbergensis in central Africa and perhaps myriad other humans yet to be discovered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ddd786cf5b2fbc3fda710a930361dddca4ff62/0_12_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2aee19da81f0fc615d7d59658a6cb0a9","title":"england team taking on world sporting final the spin","story":"Perhaps you take some World Cup with your breakfast. Or maybe you prefer some late-night Wimbledon or a soupçon of Tour de France. A side of grand prix, or a shaving of Australian men’s cricket, some New Zealand women’s cricket or a Virat Kohli surprise? What – you’re feeling a bit full? A digestif? No problem – Ronaldo’s late-career move. Ah, something less chewy, more low key and played purely for love – I’ve got just the thing.Forget Wednesday night and, perhaps, Sunday, and maybe there is an England side playing in an international final this very day.But unless you’ve been very alert you won’t know much about it, as the behemoths of sport have pulled on the sweatbands and flexed their muscles to dominate this long hot summer.At 11.30am BST on Wednesday, the England physical disability team took the field in the final of their round-robin competition between the three best sides in the world – Pakistan, Bangladesh and England. It is the first time there has been a PD tournament in this country.Unlike in visual impairment cricket, where you have three categories of visual impairment and have to play a certain number of each player, in PD cricket you either pass an assessment or you don’t. Which means you have a real range of players in the team, some with prosthetic legs, others with club feet, others with cerebral palsy, others again are arm amputees.The standard of cricket is incredibly high – power hitting exists in PD cricket just as it does in other forms of the game. And the stories are pretty mind-blowing.Take Matt Askin, a lower-arm amputee, who used to bat with a prosthetic left-hand resting on his bat, but found it awkward and fancied becoming more of a Jason Roy as PD cricket too moved towards the T20 game. He spent the winter of 2015-2016 learning how to bat with just with his right hand. Now he hits sixes.Or Callum Flynn, a promising teenage all-rounder, who was told on his 14th birthday that he had bone cancer of the knee. A life-saving operation, a couple of years of physiotherapy and a titanium knee later, and he was back. He made 64 not out on Tuesday to guide England to the final and in the words of his England captain Iain Nairn is “the best PD cricketer in the world. A batsman who plays shots that, if Joe Root was playing them, would be in a highlights package for many a year.”Or Liam Thomas, he of the internet meme-fame, whose prosthetic right leg came off as he ed and then rolled over to stop a boundary against Pakistan in Dubai in 2016. He hopped after the ball, threw it back in, and then hopped back to retrieve his leg. Stuart Broad was among those who shared the clip on Twitter, and it went viral – with CNN calling the ECB two weeks before the Trump election asking to show the clip.Or the captain Nairn, an insolvency practitioner, who played Durham age-group cricket up to under-19 level, despite losing his leg below the knee when he was 16 months old.Pakistan took the Physical Disability Tri-Series trophy at Chester Road on Wednesday, with a commanding 45-run victory over England in the final. The top three in Pakistan\u0027s batting line-up – Hasnain Alam (48), Muhammad Shahbaz (34) and wicketkeeper-batsman Saif Ullah (31) – all scored quickly to get their innings off to a strong start, but their tally of 189 for 7 still looked reachable for an England side who successfully chased 196 against Bangladesh on Monday.\u0026nbspHowever, Pakistan\u0027s left-arm seamer Abdullah Ejaz tore into England\u0027s top order, with Alex Hammond the only one of his side\u0027s first five batsmen to reach double figures, and the game soon slipped from their grasp. Liam O\u0027Brien – contributing a savage 75 from just 40 balls to add to his 2 for 32 with ball in hand earlier – offered a glimmer of hope, but he was last man out with his side still well short and only 10 balls remaining. Ejaz finished with a superb 5 for 22 from his four overs.“I had a cricket bat in my hand before the operation,” he says, “and a few days later I had a cricket bat back in my hands. I played school-boy county cricket right up to when in effect the disability then held me back and it was the end of my dream of playing for England.”He was then lost to the game for 14 years until he found PD cricket in 2012, or rather it found him. Prior to that he’d never played disability sport.“It was just one of those things. The Paralympics in 2012 highlighted the different sports that disabled athletes could participate in, but prior to that it wasn’t necessarily an exciting option.“I’d always been a cricketer, but cricket was my passion and there wasn’t a disabled national cricket team. I don’t really class myself as disabled – it is more anything you can do I can do better. The only thing I can’t do is hop on my right leg, but I’ll have a very good try. All of us are quite stubborn in that way, all of us have been playing club cricket with able-bodied cricketers – the key is to find your level.”The key is also having the right equipment. Nairn sends a text over with a photograph of his prosthetic limb. It’s a smart looking bit of kit – matt black, looking a bit like a giant shin pad with a foot attached. PD cricketers can’t wear the running blades you see on the track at the Paralympics as cricket is more of a static sport. Players need a heel.“It is an NHS high-mobility leg that I wear all the time. Maybe one day we’ll have different legs for batting, bowling and fielding but we’re very lucky, we’re definitely the most mobile of the teams because of the NHS supply of legs.”Whatever the different limbs on show on Wednesday, Nairn sees it as a huge opportunity to show people what PD cricketers can do.“It’s as big a game as we’ve played. As with anything, when your team is winning the enthusiasm and support for the game grows. We’re seeing it with the football, and we’re hoping we can do the same.“We always look to have a rallying cry for people to get in touch and get involved, we’re quite certain that there are people who don’t count themselves as disabled but who are classified as disabled and could play for England. We are proud of our disabilities and proud of the way of the way we overcome them. This is not somewhere where we come to feel disabled and sorry for ourselves.”If you miss them on Wednesday, you can catch England playing the Rest of The World at New Road on Friday, before the T20 blast match between Worcestershire Rapids and Northamptonshire Steelbacks.This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

No such problems will affect Tim Brennan, a vet from Kilkenny, when he defends himself next week against corruption charges.“I’ll be bringing a lawyer and a barrister, and I’ll be using an English barrister as well,” Brennan told me yesterday. I checked with the BHA and in fact they’ve been notified by Brennan’s legal team of three barristers and a solicitor who will be attending the hearing on Monday and Tuesday to represent his interests. One of these barristers is very well known in legal circles. He is Edward Fitzgerald QC, whose resume is extraordinarily impressive and includes appearances before the Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the European Court of Human Rights and the Caribbean Court of Justice. Evidently, he has also presented arguments in Belize, Grenada, St Vincent, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Trinidad and Tobago, St Lucia, Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands. So he is about ready for the crowning moment of his career, the chance to speak in the basement of 75 High Holborn. Media interest has, understandably, gravitated towards the notoriety of some of those Fitzgerald has represented, including Myra Hindley, Jon Venables and Abu Hamza. “Everybody is entitled to a fair trial,” he told the  and you’d like to think he was pushing on an open door with that particular line of argument. I’ve been attending BHA hearings for a few years and I can’t remember anyone arriving with this kind of legal weaponry in tow. I think we can say that Brennan’s defence will be well presented. Brennan, who works for Willie Mullins, is accused of passing on information to his brother about Faugheen, shortly before that horse was withdrawn from the 2016 Champion Hurdle, and thereby allowing his brother to make a profit by betting against the horse. Brennan denies it. “I’m defending myself from false allegations,” he told me this week. “I’m going to prove that these allegations are false. I guess they wanted to blame somebody and maybe the person who did it didn’t want to co-operate.” So much for next week’s drama. Today’s drama will be at Catterick, where a workaday card is spiced up by the Turmeric Handicap, named for the durable beast who won a load of staying handicaps at the Scotch Corner track in the late 80s.Italian Riviera (4.10), making his umpteenth appearance in this space, is 7-2 for a third course and distance success in a row. His mark has gone up again but by a manageable 6lb and he might even be able to win this without turning in a career best effort, depending on how the others fare. He’s had a useful break since his last start and I’ll stick with Ken Slack’s veteran. Size Matters (4.45) is attractive at 9-2 in the following seven-furlong handicap. From the Mark Walford yard, which has been among the winners, he ran well but needed his first run back and now has the chance to build on his Ayr success at this distance in August. The nap is at Yarmouth, where Kaanoon (3.50) is an even-money shot to score on his handicap debut after a couple of novice wins. Roger Varian’s three-year-olds made a stuttering start to the year but it seems to me they are, as a group, starting to come good.

Sky rookie Egan Bernal led the way with Chris Froome on his wheel, only for Philippe Gilbert to launch a blistering attack.He shot his bolt a little too earlier and was passed by Colbrelli and Sagan. The Italian looked to have the legs on his rival, but the man in the green jersey got past him to finish first by a bike-length or so. Gilbert was third. The winning time? 4hr 48min 06sec. Of course he does! It’s a Who’s Who of the peloton’s finest as Peter Sagan leads the field over the finish line after a brutal dual with Sonny Corbrelli from the Bahrain Meridia team. Philippe Gilbert was third. 1.6km to go: All the big names line up behind young Sky rider Egan Bernal as they hit the final climb to the line. 4km to go: Bora Hansrohe, Sky and Wanty-Groupe are all well represented at the front of the bunch as each team tries to block their rivals ahead of the imminent bottleneck. Sky riders Moscon, Thomas, Kwiatkowski and Froome are all well positioned. So too are Peter Sagan and Greg van Avermaet. 6km to go: Sky riders Wout Poels and Gianni Moscon do short turns at the front of the bunch before peeling off. The Skybots are in complete control of this peloton with five riders at the front as we reach the sharp end of this stage. Rein Taaramae’s attack and dreams of glory come to a very abrupt end. 7.5km to go: Rein Taaramae zooms clear of the bunch, catching his colleagues napping. The 31-year-old Estonian opens a gap of 15 seconds as the riders of Team Sky line up at the front of the peloton. 10km to go: With Calmajane and Skujins caught, Direct Energie’s Rein Taaramae attacks off the front of a peloton that is depleted, shorn of many of its sprint specialists, but still big. On the subject of sprint specialists, yesterday’s stage winner Fernando Gaviria is still looking strong. Intermediate sprint: Quick Step’s Julian Alaphilippe attacks off the front of the bunch, passes Calmejane and Skujins and takes three bonus seconds that send him virtual fourth on GC. He was marked by Van Avermaet there, but the yellow jersey couldn’t beat him to the line. Alaphilippe takes three bonus seconds, Van Avarmaet takes two and Calmajane takes one. 12km to go: Calmejane and Skujins take on the stiff climb to the intermediate sprint and look over their shoulders after feeling the collective breath of their peloton on their necks. The gap is 10 seconds, but nobody in the bunch seems interested in competing for the bonus seconds. 15km to go: Calmejane (Direct Energie) and Skujins (Trek Segafredo) pedal on, while Chris Froome and a couple of his lieutenants make their way to the front of the bunch just 30 seconds behind them. There are riders from BMC and Movistar at the front of the peloton, with Greg van Averamaet’s yellow jersey visible towards the front. 18km to go: The gap is a little under a minute with a nasty turn coming up in four kilometres time. Expect much movement in the peloton as the big boys jockey for position at the front of the bunch.24km to go: Up front, Lilian Calmejane and Toms Skujins have dropped Nicolas Edet as they stand on their pedals and head onwards and upwards towards the summit of the Cote de la Montagne de Locronan. Skujins is first over and takes two more KOM points. The gap to the peloton is exactly one minute. 25km to go: The peloton hits the foot of the final categorised climb of the day – but not the final climb – as the lading trio negotiate a short stretch of cobbles 1,500m from the summit. The streets are narrow and the bends are tight. In the peloton, four or five riders hit the deck. 27km to go: On Eurosport, the commentary team of Sean Kelly and Carton Kirby are now explaining that the he bonus sprint, with bonus seconds up for grabs, comes with 12 kilometres to go. It is, they say, in a “very gnarly, twisty and narrow” technically challenging stretch of road and they rather concerned that there could be all sorts of carnage in the battle to get near the front and be in a good position for that the final kilometres ahead. 31km to go: Our three leaders have a gap of 1min 44sec over the peloton, who don’t seem to be working particularly hard to reel them in. Behind the bunch, there are two separate groups of dropped riders, with Mark Cavendish, Mark Renshaw, Ryan Zabel, Marcel Kittel and other sprinters taking up the rear. 39km to go: Calmejane, Skujins and Edet maintain a gap of over two minutes on the peloton, which is pedalling hard enough to have shed most of the sprinters. It’s lumpy all the way to the finish, with one Category 3 climb left to negotiate. They’ll have street furniture, narrow roads and dark tree lined passages to negotiate between now and the finish on a very technical run-in with fast downhills and tight corners.On Eurosport, Sean Kelly reminds viewers that the usual rules about crashing inside the final three kilometres of stages (that aren’t time trials or mountainous) do not apply on this stage. Anyone unlucky enough to go down or suffer a mechanical will not get the same time as the group they happen to be in at that time. 45km to go: Up the narrow mountain road they go, with Trek-Segafredo rider Toms Skujins attacking again and taking the two King of the Mountain points available. He’s followed over by Calmejane. Nicolas Edet is behind them struggling, while Sylvain Chavanel’s goose looks cooked for today. The gap between the stage leaders and the peloton is 2min 19sec. 46km to go: With one kilometre to go to the summit of the penultimate climb of the day, Toms Skujins attacks but is followed by Lilian Calmejane. The Frenchman looks over his shoulder to see where Sylvain Chavanel is, but there’s no sign of him. 51km to go: Things go from bad to worse for Mark Cavendish, who has now been dropped by his fellow struggling sprinters. He’s over five minutes off the pace being set by our four leaders. They are: Lilian Calmejane (Direct Energie), Sylvain Chavanel (Direct Energie), Tom Skujins (Trek-Segafredo) and Nicolas Edet (Cofidis). The gap from them to the main peloton is just 1min 37sec as they approach the beginning of the penultimate climb of the day. 54km to go: There’s been a crash in the peloton and it looks like Adam Yates (Mitchelton -Scott) and the current King of the Mountains Dion Smith (Wonty Group) were both involved. They’re back on their bikes but have lost over a minute on the bunch. This is bad news for Yates, who has now suffered three bad falls in five stages of this race. 61km to go: Chavanel is rejoined by his team-mate Lilian Calmejane, who has been unable to shake off Toms Skujins and Nicolas Edet from the original breakaway. In a perfect world, he’d have got rid of the duo and he and Chavanel would have controlled the rest of the stage between them, setting Calmejane up for the win and putting Chavanel in the King of the Mountains jersey. After that? Well, I like to think they’d have spent their dotage sanding boats together somewhere. It could still happen, but Skujins is looking strong. 62km to go: Chris Froome has a mechanical, gets a bike change and is now being paced back on to the bunch by his team-mates. 66km to go: Sylvain Chavanel begins the third official climb of the day, the Cat 3 Cote de la Roche du Feu with a 2min 59sec lead over the bunch. Chavanel’s team-mate Lilian Calmejane is 25 seconds back in a group of three with the Latvian Toms Skujins and Nicolas Edet. Chavanel is first over the third climb, while Calmejane prevents either of the other two from getting any KOM points. 69km to go: The peloton is breaking up, as is the breakaway group ahead of it, while Sylvain Chavanel’s face is a mask of pain as he negotiates the latest in a series of punchy, steep, uncategorised climbs out in the Bretagne countryside. Chavanel has a lead of 3min 03sec over the bunch.70km to go: It’s turning into bad day for Mark Cavendish, who has just been dropped again on an uncategorised climb. Marcel Kittel, who is also enduring a bad spell of form, is also in trouble. “If he’s struggling in Brittany, I shudder to think how much he’ll struggle when we get to the Alps and the Pyrenees,” says TV’s Ned Boulting. 77km to go: As things stand: Sylvain Chavanel is alone in front of the race with a 45 second lead over six riders: Julien Vermote (Dimension Data), Jasper De Buyst (Lotto-Soudal), Lilian Calmejane (Direct Energie), Tom Skujins (Trek-Segafredo) and Nicolas Edet (Cofidis). Their lead over the peloton is around 2min 50sec.78km to go: Elie Gesbert is swallowed up by the peloton, but looks OK following his brush with the local foliage. He’s dirty, but not covered in the scratches and cuts I expected to see. A fall up front: Breton rider Elie Gesbert, the youngest cyclist in the breakaway group has just overshot on the outside on a descent, gone off the road and into a grass margin, where he was dragged through some roadside shrubbery in his ultimately futile attempts to stay on his bike. It could have been a lot worse and he’s back in action. That might have been very painful, depending on what kind of brambles he’s just been effectively car-washed by in that ditch. Hopefully they were just leaves, without any spiky stuff. Gesbert is currently caught in no-man’s land between the what’s left of the original breakaway group and the peloton. An email from Matt Cast: “Clever move from Direct Energie,” he says. “They will be hoping that Chavanel will hoover up some climbing points at the front while Lilian Calmejane sits quietly at the back of the chasing group conserving energy to make a move. Calmejane will fancy the final kms of this stage - he’s a great finisher with a nose for a successful breakaway.”86km to go: Chavanel has opened a gap of 46 seconds on the other six escapees and is first over the second climb of the day, which puts him first in the KOM standings. He’s also in line to win his second combativity award, which is awarded by judges for the most attacking rider on each stage. He won it on stage two. 96km to go: The peloton breast the summit of the first climb of the day, the Category 4 Cote De Kalifton, with Mark Cavendish pedalling solo, having become detached from the back. He’ll make up the ground on the way down, no doubt. 98km to go: BMC lead the chase up the first climb with the gap to the breakaway group at 3min 23sec. Meanwhile, Adam Becket has this to say about Peter Sagan’s chances of ever winning a Grand Tour.“While the GC remains dominated by time-trialling and high mountains, it seems that GC might be out of Sagan’s reach,” he says. “It has been suggested, however, that one of the Grand Tours could change their route to make it medium-mountain dominated, a more punchier course, so that riders like Sagan or Greg Van Avermaet could challenge for the win – a course for all-rounders, rather than time-trial or climbing specialists. Don’t know if this would ever actually happen, though.”Sylvain Chavanel attacks: The French veteran jumps off the front of the breakaway group with a kilometre to go to the top of the first climb, presumably with the idea of bagging himself the King of the Mountain point on offer and possibly getting his hands on the polka dot jersey. There’s no reaction behind him as his six fellow escapees leave him to it. John Suitor has a question: “Writing from Boulder, Colorado,” he says. “Can you explain the stature of Peter Sagan to me? If he’s among the best in the world, shouldn’t he be competing in the general classification of a grand tour or two? Or, is the GC so specialized that the truly best riders don’t compete for it?”Off the top of my head I would say that Peter Sagan couldn’t compete for a GC win as he’s not good enough at climbing or time-trialling. He’d need to lose quite a lot of weight without losing power to even give himself a chance and that’s a dangerous road to go down, in every sense. If any cycling experts out there know better than me and have any other gems of wisdom to impart on the subject, please feel free to get in touch. How are they all in Boulder, John? Isn’t that Lance and Floyd’s neck of the woods? 109km to go: Having been first past the post in the intermediate sprint, Sylvain Chavanel enjoys a spot of lunch. The Frenchman is 39 and currently participating in his 18th Tour de France. He takes the record outright from Stuart O’Grady and Jens Voight, who are on 17 each but have both retired.Intermediate sprint: The breakaway complete the intermediate sprint, with none of them looking particularly fussed about contesting green jersey points that don’t matter to any of them. I think Sylvain Chavanel, the elder statesman of the group of seven riders, was first across the line. The gap is 4min 13sec. 119km to go: The breakaway group lead the bunch by 4min 23sec, with the peloton happy to let them enjoy their lead as they approach the intermediate sprint at Roudoullec, where the seven men in the escape party will hoover up most of the points on offer. After that they hit the lumpy stuff, with two Category 4 climbs, followed by three Category Three climbs before the finish. Sharp climbs and narrow roads mean the second half of today’s stage will be attritional. Controversy! An interesting post from the Twitter feed of PA Sport writer Ian Parker. Mitchelton Scott’s Stage Four video diary: The Aussie team have released this footage of their day’s fun yesterday, which provides an interesting insight into life behind the scenes on the Tour de France..127km to go: The gap goes out to 4min 30sec, with BMC rider Simon Gerrans towing the bunch along. These are the men in front: Elie Gesbert (Fortuneo-Samsic), Julien Vermote (Dimension Data), Jasper De Buyst (Lotto-Soudal), Lilian Calmejane (Direct Energie), Sylvain Chavanel (Direct Energie), Tom Skujins (Trek-Segafredo) and Nicolas Edet (Cofidis). 137km to go: The gap between the seven-man breakaway and the chasing posse, which is quite strung out, is 3min 47sec as they roll through the Brittany town of Saint Yvi. All five of today’s categorised climbs are in the final 100 kilometres of the stage, but the intermediate sprint comes first, 111 kilometres from the finish. The riders are currently having to negotiate several punchy, uncategorised climbs. George Young has a question: “What is the rationale for Greg van Avermaet having the yellow jersey over Tejay van Garderen?” he asks of the two BMC riders who have the exact same time. “Is there some sort of count-back or has Greg van Avermaet simply accrued fewer yellow cards? Or have I just been watching too much sport this month?”Well George, while the two riders have the same time for the four stages they’ve completed, Van Avermaet got the yellow jersey because he’d finished ahead of Van Garderen in the first two stages (albeit in the same finishing groups, hence the identical times). This, from the Tour rulebook: “The general inidual time ranking is established by adding together the times achieved by each rider in the 21 stages including time penalties. In the event of a tie in the general ranking, the hundredth of a second recorded by the timekeepers during the inidual time trial stages will be included in the total times in order to decide the overall winner. If a tie should still result from this, then the places achieved for each stage are added up and, as a last resort, the place obtained in the final stage is counted.”BMC could, if they wanted, come to an arrangement whereby Van Garderen gets a career first day in yellow, but it’s a risky strategy. 145km to go: The riders are back out the country, with the peloton currently riding through the dappled shadows of some narrow roads sheltered by a canopy of tree branches. Fun fact: Didier Deschamps, manager of the France football team, and his wife Claude have a holiday home in Concarneau, which is where she was born and reared. I’m guessing they’re not in today. 152km to go: Our seven man escape party has increased their lead to just under four minutes as the peloton pass through the attractive looking town of Concarneau. To Wikipedia ... and don’t spare the horses ... The town has two distinct areas: the modern town on the mainland and the medieval Ville Close, a walled town on a long island in the centre of the harbour. Historically, the old town was a centre of shipbuilding. The Ville Close is now devoted to tourism with many restaurants and shops aimed at tourists. However restraint has been shown in resisting the worst excesses of souvenir shops. Also in the Ville Close is the fishing museum. The Ville Close is connected to the town by a bridge and at the other end a ferry to the village of Lanriec on the other side of the harbour.163km to go: The gap from the Magnificent Seven to the bunch is 3min 15sec and we bring you news of another couple of withdrawals. Team Sunweb’s Australian rider Michael Matthews was forced to pull out overnight with illness. Lotto Soudal rider Tiesj Benoot also withdrew this morning after dislocating his shoulder in a crash yesterday. The 176 strong field that started the Tour on Saturday has now been reduced by six. Sylvain Chavanel the virtual leader: The Direct Energie rider is highest placed in the breakaway and began this morning with a deficit of 1min 48sec. 173km to go: The gap between the seven-man breakaway and the bunch is out to 3min 11sec. Earlier in the stage, there was a crash involving Sky rider Gianni Moscon and Katusha-Alpecin rider Robert Kiserlovski, apparently involving a race motorbike. Kiserlovski has come out worst and has been forced to abandon, while Moscon has rejoined the bunch. More news on Kiserlovski’s condition as we get it. Stage four report: Jeremy Whittle is the ’s man gadding about France, eating too much service station food and not getting enough sleep. Here’s his report on Fernando Gaviria’s win in yesterday’s sprint finish. It was the Colombian rookie’s second win in this year’s Tour.Racing is under way: The roll-out is over, race director Christian Prudhomme has given the signal to start racing and the field have 25 kilometres behind them with another 180 to go. A group of seven riders have opened a gap of exactly three minutes on the peloton. Our breakaway group: Elie Gesbert (Fortuneo-Samsic), Julien Vermote (Dimension Data), Jasper De Buyst (Lotto-Soudal), Lilian Calmejane (Direct Energie), Sylvain Chavanel (Direct Energie), Tom Skujins (Trek-Segafredo) and Nicolas Edet (Cofidis). William Fotheringham’s stage-by-stage guide: Day two in Brittany, and a final 100 kilometres with five climbs, none long but all steep, with the bonus sprint on a further short ascent near the finish. A good day for a break as the finale will be hard to control, or for a sprinter who can climb like Sagan or Arnaud Démare. A classic tense stage when the Tour won’t be won but it could be lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd63fa9093910bc778d6ec16ad03046514cad2c/0_108_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed9aa293637e5e18a4a8faa3db47644","title":"from online to on the high street how one fashion brand made the move","story":"Festival-going retailer Carrie Hyndman on expanding her venture Junkbox Apparel with a store and creative space in ChesterWhen Carrie Hyndman finally set up her first bricks-and-mortar store for her adventure clothing brand, Junkbox Apparel, she did not want to lose sight of where she gained much of her inspiration – festivals. So she’s brought that creative buzz into a multi-faceted retail space.Joining up with another clothing designer, The Grunge Monkey, Hyndman launched The 2nd Floor in Chester in April. The idea was to make it a place where people could come in to get a feel for her brand, but also where creative minds could relax and be inspired. Within it, she has set up a coffee shop, a space for artists to showcase their work and an area for local musicians to play and sell records. “We feel really passionately about what we do, but also about the creative community around us. We wanted to offer that support to other people in our position,” she says.Hyndman knows many sides of the creative industry, putting her in a good place to make the space work. Not only does she sell her own clothes, but she splits her time with her band, Campfire Social, and is a keen wakeboarder and surfer. Each summer, she travels from festival to festival, sets up shop, meets new people and sells her clothes to like-minded folk.“Part of the whole idea of the brand is going out travelling and being outdoors. I don’t want to lose that,” she says. “It’s great to have a place that reflects that.”Hyndman started Junkbox Apparel as an online clothing shop in 2013, drawing on a background in retail and her jewellery design hobby. “It came from my own interests and what I wanted in my wardrobe – leisurewear for people who enjoy the outdoors.” The name she picked out with her mum, inspired by where people tend to store their accessories, in particular their costume jewellery. “You used to call that junk jewellery, hence where Junkbox came from,” she says. “It applies to what the brand is now: you chuck your stuff in a bag and you’re off.”The idea of travelling light evolved from her days of going on holiday with a different outfit packed for each day. “I hate doing that now, but I still like to look good and I like to be comfortable.” Which is why she came up with the capsule set: a few items of clothes that centre around a similar colour palette and activity that mix and match, so they are all that is needed for a weekend away. “You chuck them in a bag and you’re done,” she says.It’s a simple concept, but growing the business has been anything but smooth sailing. Hyndman believes there is “no original idea any more” – instead, building a business means carving out a niche, getting the brand name noticed, and collaborating rather than competing. “I think that encourages you to look at what you’re doing,” she says. “Looking at the competition and making it not competition, making them your peers.”“The nice thing is, I take a little bit less along to festivals now,” she says. “I used to take a clipboard, notebook, stock sheets, and loads of things like that. The stock management side of it became a little bit of hard work. Now I just take a little box with my carrier bags, my Square Reader and then my van with as much stock as I can fit into it.”Having launched The 2nd Floor in April, Hyndman has bigger plans for Junkbox Apparel. “I want to say take over the world, but we won’t be doing that any time soon – I’ve got to be realistic,” she laughs.Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ee417425ea98240e4e4de4aa6076868ba1cc52/0_204_4361_2617/master/4361.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa7c411cd91fd3a1f23630ae31bf6696","title":"us immigration family separations doj us citizens","story":"ACLU calls revelation ‘horrific’ and blames administration’s poor execution of family separation policyThe Department of Justice told a federal judge Tuesday that it may have mistakenly separated a father and toddler who could both be US citizens for as long as a year, in the process of enforcing the Trump administration zero-tolerance immigration policy.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the revelation “horrific” and blamed the administration’s poor execution of the practice of family separations.“The fact that a citizen got caught up in this mess shows just how poor the government’s record-keeping was, and this is just the latest example,” said Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.On 26 June, in a suit filed by the ACLU against the government over the separation of families at the southern border, federal judge Dana Sabraw granted a preliminary injunction requiring the reunification of children under the age of five by 10 July.In a hearing on Tuesday, just before the deadline, the DoJ was asked to account for each failed reunification of the 102 younger children in its care. It noted 27 cases where it found reunification was not currently feasible, including one “because the parent’s location has been unknown for more than a year … and records show the parent and child might be US citizens.”Previously the DoJ had only revealed that the child’s father could not be located. The ACLU and the court were only made aware that both father and child might be US citizens on Tuesday.In total the DoJ said it expected to have 38 children under five reunified by Tuesday’s 10pm PT deadline, 16 “soon thereafter” and another 20 depending on a number of conditions including whether or not parents can be located, and “if those parents request reunification”.In Tuesday’s hearing, Judge Sabraw said that the families were improperly separated and that he would not extend the deadline, meaning that the government is technically in violation of the court order as of Tuesday night. “These are firm deadlines. They’re not aspirational goals,” Sabraw said.The identity of the children and parents as provided to the judge by the government under court order are currently shielded by law. The Legal Aid Society in New York said it is representing at least two of the separated children under five.One boy, from El Salvador, was due to be released to his mother, according to Beth Krause, the supervising attorney of Legal Aid’s Immigrant Youth Project.“I have no details about where, when, under what conditions,” she wrote in an email on Tuesday morning. The other boy, from Honduras, would remain with a foster family while the father remained in government custody, although it was not clear to her why.“I know very, very little about this case,” she said. “It’s all very frustrating.”The revelation comes on the same day that the Trump administration announced it would be implementing an ankle monitor system to track migrant families – a decision that was forced by Sabraw’s injunction and another federal court decision that came down on Monday.After Trump signed an executive order ending his administration’s family separation policy in June, agencies had planned to detain families and children together until the parents’ immigration proceedings were complete, a process that can take months. That proposal ran afoul of the decades-old Flores v Reno settlement, which stipulates that migrant children cannot be held in detention for more than 20 days.Reuters contributed to this story"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30082bcb48e49fb9148742718c7a9e664c200a23/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce44bcad4aa9c39daea9d81667701198","title":"east libyan general hands back control of oil ports","story":"Khalifa Haftar ends row that shut down oil industry, ceding ports to national corporationThe east Libyan strongman Gen Khalifa Haftar has handed back control of the oil ports under his authority to the country’s national oil corporation, ending a three-week dispute that had effectively closed down the country’s oil industry and threatened to strangle efforts at political reconciliation across Libya.The ports of Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Hariga were all handed back to NOC control without any obvious tangible concession being made to Haftar. He had been pressing privately for Saddek Elkaber, the governor of the Libyan central bank, to step down, claiming that Elkaber was funnelling cash from the oil industry to militias opposed to him.A strongly worded letter from the US president, Donald Trump, warning he would take legal action against those responsible for the impasse may have prompted a change of heart.But the move coincides with a decision by the western powers to delay plans for presidential elections in Libya scheduled for December. It has been agreed that parliamentary elections will proceed on this year’s timetable, but the presidential elections will be delayed until next year. Many felt presidential elections, in the absence of any reconciliation between the east and west of the country, would fuel violence.At the time of the seizure of the ports Haftar said their proceeds would go to a rival oil corporation based in the east. The chairman of the NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, said the rival firm had neither the legal authority nor technical ability to handle the oil revenues.He also accused some of those connected with the rival firm of corruption. Sanalla appealed for and won the support of the international community, including the UN. Haftar’s closest external allies – France, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – did not support his decision, leaving him badly isolated. A meeting of representatives from foreign ministries in Rome attended by Italy, France, the UK and the US revealed no support for his stance.The Italian ambassador to Libya on Wednesday welcomed the agreementand the NOC commended Haftar’s Libyan National Army in a statement for “putting the national interest first” by handing back the ports. Sanalla acknowledged some of the concern behind the ports’ capture saying: “We need a proper national debate on the fair distribution of oil revenues. It is at the heart of the recent crisis. The real solution is transparency, so I renew my call on the responsible authorities, the ministry of finance and central bank, to publish budgets and detailed public expenditure.“I will work with other national stakeholders to enhance transparency and resolve this crisis – for the benefit of all our citizens.”The struggle between the rival governments led to a collapse in the country’s oil production, slashing output by as much as 850,000 barrels a day and costing the economy an estimated $1bn. The eastern-based authorities made a similar attempt to bypass the Tripoli government in April 2016 but their planned sale of 300,000 barrels a day of crude oil was stopped by the UN security council.The dispute is interlaced with the wider European argument about how best to stem the flow of migrants via Libya to Italy. The Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, claims his tough measures have already led to a 21,000 drop in the numbers reaching Italy in comparison with last year, but the bulk of the downturn preceded Salvini’s election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e4b7bde53ec7912f4cc5e9686fcec96658efde/552_67_4147_2488/master/4147.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81966f1caebadbff35271c4fd388ffe8","title":"greece to expel russian diplomats over alleged macedonia interference","story":"Russia accused of trying to fan opposition to deal which will weaken its influence in BalkansFour Russian diplomats will be banned from Greece after evidence revealed Russia was trying to foment opposition to a historic deal between Greece and Macedonia that is likely to pave the way for Macedonia’s Nato membership and so weaken Russian influence in the western Balkans.Greece said it would expel two Russian diplomats and ban two others.Russia, involved in a wider struggle for influence with the EU across the region, has already been accused of backing a failed coup in Montenegro in 2016.Russia said it would respond to the Greek expulsions by taking similar steps against Greek diplomats in Moscow.The expulsion of the diplomats, revealed in the Greek media on Wednesday but relayed by the Greek government to Russia on 6 July, follows evidence they were encouraging rallies to oppose the Macedonian name deal, including offering bribes to opponents of the deal.The historic naming deal, agreed on 17 June, will see the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia bow to Greek objections and change its name to Northern Macedonia. Greece had claimed the title Macedonia implied a territorial claim on the Greek province of the same name. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini named the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, an organisation which promotes Russian ties to Christians in the Middle East, as being among the groups trying to fan Russian influence in Greece, including in the Greek Orthodox monastic community of Mount Athos.A representative of the society denied it was involved in any alleged attempts to bribe senior Greek Orthodox clergymen, the Russian state Interfax news agency reported.In 2008 Nato agreed to invite Macedonia to join the military alliance once its name dispute was settled, and Wednesday’s Nato summit meeting in Brussels will conclude with a formal invitation to join Nato.The name has been disputed between the two countries ever since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.The deal faces opposition in both Greece and in Macedonia, where a heated referendum is planned this autumn.The Macedonian opposition is trying to block the establishment of an electoral commission required to prepare for the referendum. It is also accusing leading politicians in the Macedonian government of treason for agreeing to the deal.Rejection of the deal inside Greece is, amongst others, coming from the seven MPs inside Independent Greeks (ANEL), the small rightwing nationalistic party in a governing coalition with the left wing Syriza, headed by Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras.The name issue has led to splits inside ANEL, and Russian media has been promoting the idea of a new populist party led by Dimitris Kammenos, dedicated to blocking the name change. Russia and Greece have until now maintained warm relations, with Athens one of the few countries that rejected a British request to expel diplomats in the wake of British claims of Russian involvement in the poisoning of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. But the Russian embassy in Athens has been previously accused of interfering in Greek politics following the leak of a tranche of emails in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c07c113570cc43cb51914349564d1580a94f199/0_137_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcfb88c449a507d9e1e225d93db9a38","title":"somalia the rise of mogadishu artists music activists","story":"A new wave of artists, activists and entrepreneurs are trying to improve Somalia’s capital cityThe surprising sounds of a late evening in Mogadishu: surf on the beach, laughs of revellers, clinking of cups and glasses, oaths of harassed waiters and the soft melodies of the oud of Aweys Kabanle.Kabanle, a 45-year-old former dressmaker turned musician, is playing traditional Somali music at the luxury Mogadishu Beach View hotel at the city’s Lido to a smartly dressed audience in one of the world’s most dangerous cities.“This is Mogadishu. We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,” Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino.There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent.It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare.Mogadishu’s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city.Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys’s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape.“For several months following, there was no show,” he says. “People were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.”Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly £100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAhmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based.There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh’s paintings.“I do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,” the 48-year-old artist says.His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families.Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. “When people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,” Ahmed says.Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab.“When we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,” says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student.Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. “There are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,” she says.The group decided to act “because nobody else was willing to do it” and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. “We could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,” Abdulle says.So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. “We are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,” Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says.Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. “When my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,” Ibrahim says. “We now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.”In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties.Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. “Somalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,” he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu’s beach.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

On leaving their famine-ravaged home town, each girl received two dresses, two petticoats, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, a bible, a bowl and a spoon.This summer, the poignant story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from the devastation of a starving Skibbereen to Australia – where they were referred to as “breeders” – will be recalled in a bronze sculpture and a large piece of Australian sandstone in the West Cork town.“This is a story of bravery, the bravery of women it is a story of heroines,” says Skibbereen-based artist Toma McCullim. The girls from the Skibbereen Union Workhouse were despatched to Australia to provide labour, marry, have children and help colonise the sprawling continent.It’s uncertain how much choice, if any, they had in their departure, the artist says. At the time, 60 people a day were dying in the Skibbereen workhouse, which was rife with disease and hunger.The 110 were essentially “farmed”, says the artist with Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre, who has been the driving force behind the year-long 110 Skibbereen Girls public art project.In documentation she studied as part of her research through residencies at Uillinn, West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and at the site of Skibbereen Workhouse, now Skibbereen Community Hospital Campus, the girls were referred to as “breeders”.The residencies allowed McCullim to carry out research and support a variety of tours, talks, film screenings and participatory workshops on the theme of the 110 girls and their journey to Australia.The 110 girls departed for Australia under the Earl Grey Famine Orphan Scheme, named after the colonial secretary who enacted it.This scheme had two aims: to reduce overcrowding in Irish workhouses through an assisted emigration scheme and to send female immigrants to settle in Australia where at the time there were nine men for every woman.The board of s in every union in Ireland put forward the names of suitable girls aged 14-18. An estimated 4,000 girls left the country under the scheme. Skibbereen Workhouse offered the most girls outside Dublin. There are believed to be in the region of 10,000 descendants of the young Skibbereen emigrants.Although the girls did not have to be orphans to be eligible for the scheme, it was stipulated that they were not to be living with their families, be of good character, unmarried and without children so that there would be no impediment to marrying Australian settlers.“Many of them did better in Australia than they could have done in the prevailing conditions in Ireland at the time,” says McCullim.At least two descendants are expected to make the journey to Skibbereen next month for a special ceremony honouring their ancestors’ story.One hundred and 10 bronze spoons have been cast by McCullim from beeswax moulds created by staff and residents at the Skibbereen Community Hospital complex, formerly the workhouse.Throughout this month, the spoons will be embedded in the archway above what used to be the workhouse’s Women’s Entrance, near the site’s famine burial ground.This piece of public art, which will be unveiled by the Australian ambassador on July 20th, will also include an installation of a piece of Australian sandstone, donated by the Australian embassy, which is expected to be placed in front of the archway.The ceremony will take place the day after the prestigious Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger exhibition of historical and contemporary artwork from Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, Quinnipiac University in the US state of Connecticut, opens in Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.The exhibition is on display in Dublin Castle"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561353.1531316098!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon coveney says it has been a good week for brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said the British government was moving to “what the majority of people are looking for - which is a sensible, soft Brexit.” File photograph: Cyril ByrneMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said that it has been “a good week for Brexit” and that the EU will now “try to accommodate some of the British thinking”.However, he also said that there are things that the EU cannot and will not compromise on.Mr Coveney praised the British Prime Minister Theresa May for facing down the hard Brexiteers in her Cabinet and said that he move has unlocked the potential for serious negotiations to begin between the EU and the UK.“It looks very clear that the British Prime Minister is going to survive this week politically,” Mr Coveney said.“I think she has shown some authority as a prime minister and I think that was needed on Brexit. Now I think that the serious negotiation on the future relationship needs to begin and we need to conclude over the summer the legal text of a withdrawal agreement that of course has an Irish backstop in it,” he said.He said that the British government was moving to “what the majority of people are looking for - which is a sensible, soft Brexit.”Mr Coveney was speaking to journalists at the Institute of International and European Affairs think-tank in Dublin where he was making a speech about EU-Africa relationsHe said that the “EU will take the new position of the UK on Brexit seriously.”“I think there will be some challenges from some of the proposals coming from the British government in the context of both customs and single market alignment on goods and agrifood. But I think it is a basis for a real negotiation,” Mr Coveney said.“There will clearly be some issues that require negotiation and teasing out. But I think we would also recognise that actually despite all of the political movement and challenges at Westminster, I think this has been a good week for Brexit .”However, he warned that at least some of what the British Government was looking for in the future relationship would be impossible to deliver.“There will be many in the EU who will say, ‘Look, you’re either in or you’re out’, in terms of the single market and the customs union. Britain is asking for something a little different to that. I think we need to see whether the task force can accommodate some of the British thinking, or not. “I think people have always said that if Britain was willing to show some flexibility on their red lines, then the EU would try to respond with some generosity and flexibility.“But there are things that the EU can’t do. Michel Barnier and the task force can’t negotiate an outcome that compromises the integrity of the EU single market for everybody else. He can’t compromise the workings of a shared customs union across the EU for everyone else. “But having said that I think there will be an attempt to try and accommodate some of the British thinking in a way that protects the integrity of the single market and customs union. That’s not going to be easy, but at least we have clarity from the British government what they are looking for.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Greece did not join most other NATO allies in March in withdrawing diplomats from Moscow over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England. Britain blamed Russia for that incident. Moscow denied involvement.Greece accused the Russian diplomats of activities inconsistent with their status, including illegal activities against national security, Kathimerini, the Greek daily newspaper, reported, adding that these had included attempts at bribery.Asked about the report, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told Skai TV: “The Greek government ... cannot tolerate behavior which violates international law and which does not show respect to the Greek state.”“It is our assessment that there has been such behavior, and for that precise reason all necessary measures will be taken,” he added, without explicitly confirming the expulsions.The Greek foreign ministry, contacted by Reuters, echoed the spokesman’s statement and did not go further.A member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, Andrei Klimov, told RIA news agency that Moscow would expel two Greek diplomats in response to the Greek move, without mentioning Macedonia or giving further detail about the matter.Riot policemen in Greece arrest a demonstrator during a June protest against the name deal with MacedoniaMoscow has long opposed the eastern expansion of NATO, regarding it as a direct threat to its own security. Many countries that were once in Moscow’s orbit have joined NATO and the European Union since the fall of communism in 1989.Macedonia expects to receive the invitation to join NATO at a two-day summit of the alliance that starts in Brussels on Wednesday, though it will only become a member if it adopts the new name agreed in principle with Greece.Greece had long argued that Macedonia’s name implies a territorial claim over its northern province of the same name, and had previously blocked its neighbor’s attempts to join NATO. Macedonia will hold a referendum on the name deal.Kathimerini said Greek authorities were investigating whether the Russian diplomats had meddled in Greece’s internal affairs and quoted diplomatic sources as saying the suspicions were solely focused on those four iniduals.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (R) and Prime Minister of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) Zoran Zaev (L) sign an accord to rename the Balkan nation“(This is) an amazing and highly significant development given close ties between Athens and Moscow,” said James Ker-Lindsay, senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics. “It is a clear warning not to abuse friendship. Extraordinary!” he tweeted.Kathimerini said there was also growing unease in Athens over the increased influence of the Russian Orthodox Church at Mount Athos, an all-male monastic community in northern Greece.Please review our commenting policyNew flu drug may be stockpiled to protect against pandemicBBC pay: only three women in top 25 highest-earners as Gary Lineker tops the salary leagueDriver who hit George Clooney claims he was \u0026#39blinded by the sun\u0026#39 as video emerges of moped collisionNew video inside the Thai cave shows how the 12 boys were rescued\u0026#39It’s over, we’re finished.

Fox agreed to buy the 61 per cent portion of Sky that it does not already own back in 2016, in a £10.75 per share deal valuing the UK broadcaster at more than £18bn. However, Comcast waded in with a higher offer of £12.50 per share earlier this year, and Sky withdrew its support for the Fox bid. On Wednesday, Fox and Sky announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a new offer of £14 per share, a 12 per cent increase on Comcast’s bid, which values Sky at £24.5bn. The companies said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange: “As the founding shareholder of Sky, 21st Century Fox has remained deeply committed to bringing these two organisations together to create a world-class business positioned to deliver the very best entertainment experiences well into the future. “21CF strongly believes that a combined 21CF and Sky will be a powerful driver for the continued growth and vibrancy of the UK and broader global creative industries.”The groups said the enhanced scale and capabilities of the combined company will “enrich Sky’s ability to continue on its mission for years to come, especially at a time of dynamic change in our industry”. “This transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world, but none of whom have demonstrated the same local depth of investment and commitment to the UK and to Europe,” Sky and Fox said. Comcast makes Sky takeover bid to rival Rupert Murdoch21st Century Fox reportedly in talks to sell most of company to DisneyGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “There’s enough sub-plots the race to acquire Sky to commission a primetime drama.”Fox coming back in for Sky is “not a surprise in itself”, Mr Salmon added, but the new offer is slightly lower than some had expected, providing another twist to the tale. “In fact, there’s every chance it might entice another counter from Comcast. That might explain why the shares still trade above the latest offer price,” he said.“Whoever ends up in control will have acquired an attractive asset, but the price tag can’t be ignored. Before Fox’s original offer, Sky was trading at under £8 a share. Yes, securing another three\u0026nbspyears of Premier League football at a lower cost is a significant development, but if the bidding war rumbles on much longer, the risk of over-paying becomes all the more real.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

It comes from a time when the universe was only a billion years old, and is by some way the strongest signal we have received from that time.The burst of energy came from a quasar located 13 billion light years away. As such, it began its journey when the universe was relatively young.This is the most detailed image yet of such a bright galaxy at this great distance, said Emmanuel Momjian, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).Scientists might now be able to examine the emission to understand more about a time when the universe looked vastly different to how it does today.We are seeing P352-15 as it was when the Universe was less than a billion years old, or only about 7 percent of its current age, said Chris Carilli, of NRAO. This is near the end of a period when the first stars and galaxies were re-ionizing the neutral hydrogen atoms that pervaded intergalactic space. Further observations may allow us to use this quasar as a background \u0027lamp\u0027 to measure the amount of neutral hydrogen remaining at that time.It might finally allow us to understand the beginnings of the earliest galaxies.The jet from this quasar could serve as an important calibration tool to help future projects penetrate the dark ages and perhaps reveal how the earliest galaxies came into being, said Bañados.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Fox agreed to buy the 61 per cent portion of Sky that it does not already own back in 2016, in a £10.75 per share deal valuing the UK broadcaster at more than £18bn. However, Comcast waded in with a higher offer of £12.50 per share earlier this year, and Sky withdrew its support for the Fox bid. On Wednesday, Fox and Sky announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a new offer of £14 per share, a 12 per cent increase on Comcast’s bid, which values Sky at £24.5bn. The companies said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange: “As the founding shareholder of Sky, 21st Century Fox has remained deeply committed to bringing these two organisations together to create a world-class business positioned to deliver the very best entertainment experiences well into the future. “21CF strongly believes that a combined 21CF and Sky will be a powerful driver for the continued growth and vibrancy of the UK and broader global creative industries.”The groups said the enhanced scale and capabilities of the combined company will “enrich Sky’s ability to continue on its mission for years to come, especially at a time of dynamic change in our industry”. “This transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world, but none of whom have demonstrated the same local depth of investment and commitment to the UK and to Europe,” Sky and Fox said. Comcast makes Sky takeover bid to rival Rupert Murdoch21st Century Fox reportedly in talks to sell most of company to DisneyGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “There’s enough sub-plots the race to acquire Sky to commission a primetime drama.”Fox coming back in for Sky is “not a surprise in itself”, Mr Salmon added, but the new offer is slightly lower than some had expected, providing another twist to the tale. “In fact, there’s every chance it might entice another counter from Comcast. That might explain why the shares still trade above the latest offer price,” he said.“Whoever ends up in control will have acquired an attractive asset, but the price tag can’t be ignored. Before Fox’s original offer, Sky was trading at under £8 a share. Yes, securing another three\u0026nbspyears of Premier League football at a lower cost is a significant development, but if the bidding war rumbles on much longer, the risk of over-paying becomes all the more real.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Conditions are such that detainees suffer mental health problems which sometimes lead to\u0026nbspsuicide attempts, according to the charity.Thousands of innocent asylum seekers –\u0026nbspoften fleeing war and torture – are detained each year and\u0026nbsplocked up indefinitely\u0026nbspwith no support, the charity warned.In the first intervention of its kind by a major charity, the Red Cross calls for significant reforms including a 28-day limit on detention. It found cases of asylum-seekers being detained for as long as two years and seven months.Home Office separating scores of children from parentsHome Office makes almost £100m profit from children\u0027s citizenship feesHome Office separating scores of children from parentsFive of the 26 detainees interviewed\u0026nbspfor the report had attempted suicide while they were detained, and\u0026nbspjust 25\u0026nbspof them\u0026nbspsaid they had been given no access to mental health\u0026nbspsupport services.Pregnant women continue to be “needlessly detained” in breach of the Home Office’s own guidance –\u0026nbspwith 47 pregnant women detained in the year to June 2017.The charity said the\u0026nbsp“overly onerous and traumatic” experience of attending immigration reporting centres\u0026nbsp– which many are required to do every every two weeks – should be overhauled by banning the practice of detaining people when they turn up.Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: “Most of the people in the UK asylum process have fled conflict or persecution to find a place of safety. They have already experienced more trauma and anguish than the rest of us could possibly imagine.“The threat of detention without notice hangs over many people going through the asylum process in the UK.\u0026nbspOur research shows that not knowing whether this week will be the week they are detained again, can make the process of having to report regularly extremely distressing.“This can exacerbate existing mental health issues and mean people never truly feel free.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Red Cross report was a “damning indictment” of how the government treats migrants and refugees.“We know from the Windrush scandal that people are wrongly detained,” she said.\u0026nbsp“Some suffer indefinite detention without legal representation. The government needs to introduce some humanity into the immigration system,” she said.Figures obtained by the Red Cross through freedom of information requests show that of 14,733 asylum seekers who left detention in 2016, nearly half (42 per cent) had been detained for between 29 days and six months, with 10 per cent held for more than four months.The charity recommends that the Home Office allows people to live in their communities while their immigration cases are resolved by replacing the systems of detention and reporting with end-to-end, community-based alternatives.The Home Office told The Independent it had noted the recommendations from the report and was also carefully considering the contents of the Stephen Shaw review into the needs of vulnerable detainees, which is set to be published this month.The warnings come amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Britain is the only EU country without a statutory time limit for the detention of migrants.Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in removal centres, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.In May the Home Office came under fire\u0026nbspwhen it emerged that proven torture victims were also being detained.Inspectors from HMI Prisons joined growing calls for a time limit, warning of a “deep level of emotional distress” and rising number of suicides, and noting that 50 per cent of detainees were eventually “released back into the community”.UK news in picturesSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

What has swayed me over the last two years to fully back the Brexit vision is the immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once again.Fresh Brexit referendum necessary if MPs cannot agree, Watson suggestsWhat Dominic Raab needs to do to avoid Brexit disasterBoris may think he’s Churchill but Brexiteers don’t own patriotismFarage threatens Ukip return unless Brexit put ‘back on track’“I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name, then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No10.”Lewes MP Ms Caulfield\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspstood down from her role as Tory vice-chair for women, warning that the direction of travel did “not fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide”.Ms Caulfield said in her letter to the PM: “The policy may assuage vested interests, but the voters will find out and their representatives will be found out. This policy will be bad for our country and bad for the party.\u0026nbsp“The direct consequences of that will be prime minister Corbyn.”Her appointment to a prominent women’s role\u0026nbspdrew criticism from campaigners, as the former nurse is a vocal pro-life campaigner,\u0026nbspwho led efforts to prevent changes to strict abortion laws.People’s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealPeople’s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People’s Vote demonstration against BrexitGina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People’s Vote March‘Two months too young to decide on my future’A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowdsCrowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain’s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar SquarePro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the ‘People’s Vote’ marchConservative chairman Brandon Lewis said: “Maria Caulfield and Ben Bradley have worked hard since the start of the year to promote women and young people on behalf of the Conservative Party.

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This fudge is the result of the PM’s dithering and failure to plan for “no deal” — that essential weapon of any negotiator’s armoury.Had she won the 100-plus majority predicted before last year’s election things would be different.

We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them.

More than 250,000 have signed a petition to keep them safe.The nomadic tribespeople are master hunters who trap pigs, lizards and turtles with a specially made Jarawa bow.Being an island-dwelling tribe, food sources in the ocean are vital to their survival and men often catch fish in the shallows.They are also understood to love fruit and honey, extracting it from hives by using special plant extracts to calm the bees.They are said to have detailed knowledge of more than 150 plant and 350 animal species on the island.The Jarawa also have reputations as as warriors and uncompromising defenders of their territory.They lived through both British colonisation in the 19th century and then Japanese occupation later on.In 1998, a few Jarawa started to emerge from their forest for the first time without their bows and arrows to visit other settlements.But in 1990 local authorities revealed a long-term master plan to settle them in two villages with an economy based on fishery.The plan went as far as to suggest what style of clothes the Jarawa should now wear.Forced settlement had been fatal for other tribes in the Andaman Islands, according to Survival International.Following a passionate campaign by Survival and other Indian organisations, the resettlement plan was abandoned in the early 2000s."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds burger fries ebay price bidders","story":"Dave Alexander wanted to know if the rumours that the chains products last for years without showing any sign of rotting.So on June 7 2012, the farmer, from Ontario, Canada, asked his daughter to pop down to the nearest McDonalds and order a burger and fries.Then he put the meal on a shelf and left it there.After six years Dave decided to put the meal on eBay, with a starting bid of £17.His post, which read ORIGINAL OWNER - Never eaten, is no longer live on the shopping site, but before it was taken down bidding is thought to have reached nearly £50.The farmer claimed on Twitter that the post was removed from eBay because no expiration date had been given for the food item”.Dave told CBC Radio the food looked surprisingly decent still.He added: It basically has petrified itself.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We used it as a second home but decided to make it our main home when we retired and thought we would modernise and extend it.We had worked with an architect called Stan Bolt on a house we had in Salcombe and that was a very good experience so we went to him again.But hes a modern architect and this was a cottage. We wanted to keep the cottage as it has a lot of local history and its emotionally important to us.It would have been much easier to knock it down and build something new, but we didnt want to do that and Stan didnt either.It gave us more space for the kids and grandchildren to stay and it works well as a home, the old flows very well into the new.The area has a great atmosphere, its a lovely place to live. There are no near neighbours but its only a ten minute walk into Great Bedwyn and you can get from there to Paddington station in 71 minutes.Well be sad to see it go but life moves on.Mirldown House now has 2,908 sq ft of accommodation with an entrance hall, kitchen/breakfast room, sitting room, drawing room, dining room, study, five bedrooms and three bathrooms.There is also a garage with a workshop and store room and the gardens extend to 2.68 acres with lawns, mature trees and hedging.It has a tennis court tucked away at the side and a Grade II listed kiln in the grounds.The house is on the edge of the popular village of Great Bedwyn, which has a thriving local community and is easily commutable to London.The village is surrounded on all sides by beautiful rolling countryside and lies on the edge of Savernake Forest. The Kennet \u0026amp Avon Canal runs through the middle and the area is very popular for walking and riding."},{"url":null,"title":"the big singalong flop","story":"Instead, it’s left to the commercial broadcaster and poor old Tony Hadley, reaching something close to climax, to sing a hymn of praise to this much-neglected national treasure.At which point, I think it’s probably time to drop the laboured sarcasm, because this next event may have been the point the cult of the NHS met its Waterloo.The Big Singalong Live, from Abbey Road Studios, where the disclaimers were heavier than Wednesday night’s rain as host Sara Cox quickly established: “This was not our idea, was it, Ashley (Banjo)?”“No, no it wasn’t.”The buck was being passed very much in the direction of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir, who had come up with the perfectly ­reasonable idea of breaking television’s singalong record of 6,904 people, with a live version of The Beatles’ song With A Little Help From My Friends.Tireless and talented NHS heroes they may be, but for this thing to fly someone also clearly felt the process required some famous names to get on board.Normally, of course, this is the point when the public realises, “Ah, so it isn’t about us or the NHS at all. It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

Ya got me, Sacha. Feel better now?I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick humor of the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime.Showtime is an American entertainment company owned by CBS and behind Who Is America?Palin, 54, claims she received a request to take part in a legit historical documentary.She said she was asked to travel across the US with one of her daughters, who she did not name, to speak to a disabled US veteran.Palin wrote: Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long interview full of Hollywoodisms disrespect and sarcasm.But she said she finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohens chagrin.The politician added: The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohens foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse.Palin then asked Cohen, CBS and Showtime to donate all proceeds from the programme to a charity that that actually respects and supports American Vets.She added: Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country.Truly sick.Palin hit the headlines in 2008 when Republican presidential nominee John McCain chose her as his running mate.A teaser for Who Is America? features former US vice president Dick Cheney signing a waterboard kit.Cohen is no stranger to controversy, sparking outrage in 2009 when he appeared in his guise as gay Austrian fashion designer Bruno on a chat show claiming to have adopted an African baby which wore a T-shirt that said “Gayby”.He pretended to spill the ashes of Kim Jong-Il on the 2012 Oscar’s red carpet.And in 2003, as Ali G he interviewed Donald Trump and pitched a drip-free ice cream glove to him.The first episode of Who Is America? will air on Channel 4 at 10pm on Monday July 16."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-air-condition-heat_4359190.jpg?20180711150212 ","title":"air conditioning essential to productivity during heatwave say scientists","story":"\"Most of the research on the health effects of heat has been done in vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, creating the perception that the general population is not at risk from heatwaves,\" said Jose Guillermo Cede\u0026#241o-Laurent, the lead author of the study.\"To address this blind spot, we studied healthy students living in dorms as a natural intervention during a heatwave in Boston.\"Knowing what the risks are across different populations is critical considering that in many cities, such as Boston, the number of heatwaves is projected to increase due to climate change.\"These decreases were measurable across five different areas of cognitive function, including reaction times and working memory.Students without AC experienced 13.4% longer reaction times on tests which required them to match a colour to a word and 13.3% lower scores in simple arithmetic tests.\"Indoor temperatures often continue to rise even after outdoor temperatures subside, giving the false impression that the hazard has passed, when in fact the \u0027indoor heatwave\u0027 continues,\" said Dr Joseph Allen."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-prime-minister_4335252.jpg?20180618123003 ","title":"a reckoning postponed not extinguished where theresa may goes from here","story":"In some ways, she got lucky.As one senior Conservative (no friend of Mrs May\u0027s) told me last night: \"Boris got it wrong - again. She only has two weeks \u0027til recess. It\u0027s the worst time to resign. If she can keep her head down \u0027til then, she\u0027s safe til October.\"Her survival and unexpectedly plucky performance in the House has even led to some excited bien-pensant chatter that the resignations have left her stronger than before.The argument goes that Mr Johnson and Mr Davis were destined to resign, that their departure from the cabinet means she is now surrounded by allies, not enemies. She is liberated.She may feel relief at not having to duck and weave to please the mansplaining Mr Davis and Mr Johnson every other Thursday from now on.But medium term, it seems to me undeniable that the resignations of Mr Johnson and Mr Davis have weakened Mrs May for one very important reason. Their resignations have legitimised betrayal - both within the parliamentary Conservative Party and out.As one despondent Leaver MP said to me: \"I could have sold Chequers to my constituents. Now I can\u0027t. All they\u0027ll think now, whatever we put forward, is that it\u0027s a sellout.\"His despair is well founded: Mr Johnson in particular, one of the only political figures the public recognise, with his warnings of \"semi-Brexit\" and colonial status, seems to have gone out of his way to stoke the furnaces of Brexit apostasy.Those furnaces now burn brightly within the Conservative Party too.As Jacob Rees-Mogg told me shortly after Mr Davis resigned: \"It raises the most serious questions about the prime minister\u0027s ideas. If the Brexit secretary cannot support them, then they cannot be very good proposals.\"Fellow Brexiteer Philip Davies told the PM that her scheme represented \"a Remainer coup\".Mr Johnson and Mr Davis were appointed to their jobs because they gave Theresa May - the Remainer prime minister - Brexiteer credentials. Now they\u0027ve taken those spurs away, in spectacular fashion. It was just about conceivable that had Mrs May been able to keep Mr Johnson and certainly Mr Davis in her cabinet, she might have attracted the lion\u0027s share of Brexiteer support for her proposals if and when they come to the House of Commons in the form of a deal.But now, with her ideas damned as heresy, if the Chequers ideas aren\u0027t substantially altered (and it seems from the PM\u0027s statement in the House that they won\u0027t be) it is hard to see how or why the hardline Brexiteers can or will vote for them - and Mr Davis and Mr Johnson will lead the charge in opposition.Brexit nirvana, they will say, can be achieved if we vote them down - and thereby secure the hard Brexit we crave.If the PM had succeeded last June in winning a decent majority, this would be less of a problem.That - despite her protestations to the contrary - was the election\u0027s aim, to give her the space she needed to make the compromises she knew would necessary.These internal party contortions inexorably flow from her failure to secure it. With no majority at all every Brexiteer vote, even the votes of the three ministers who resigned, will be pivotal.It is not obvious, without her Brexiteer MPs supporting Chequers, how she can guide a deal through parliament.And if she can\u0027t, what exactly is the point of Mrs May? It is why she tried so hard to keep them on side. Without them there is only one option left for the prime minister, one remaining route through.When the final vote comes, she must attract Labour votes.If negotiations drag on to the last possible weeks, perhaps even into 2019, the PM could make a credible pitch to pro-Remain Labour MPs: vote for this, or we crash out with no deal at all. There is no time for an election. It\u0027s this, or bust. Country before party.She will therefore, in effect, be asking Labour to solve the Brexit riddle on her behalf.A tacit acceptance that the Conservative Party, with its deep, gorge-like fissures, cannot resolve the issue.That will put Remainer Labour MPs in an invidious position. The tantalising chance to defeat the government, to remove a sitting prime minister, will be theirs for the taking - but at the cost of plunging the country into profound crisis. In those circumstances, even if Jeremy Corbyn tried to whip his MPs to vote against the deal, he might find it difficult to stop some of his most pro-European colleagues traipsing into the government lobby - especially if, the cost of their votes is a continued softening of Brexit.Some of them, after all, represent some of the most Remain constituencies in the country - how will they explain to their constituents that they enabled the hardest Brexit possible?Mr Corbyn might even get in on the act, seizing the opportunity to in effect control the Brexit process and sell himself to the country as a statesman.And putting country before party might not be an entirely magnanimous act for Labour.Getting the softest of Brexits through on Labour votes would be a devastating blow for Mrs May and the Tory Party more generally. She would become the Ramsay MacDonald of the Conservative Party.The Brexiteers would probably split and form a separate grouping in parliament.The Tory Party - which has throughout its history been better at absorbing splinter groups than making them - would be more fractured and divided than at any time since the Corn Laws. This is a danger to which Brexiteers are alive. They are alarmed at reports that the government has been briefing Labour MPs about their Brexit proposals.Mr Rees-Mogg warned the PM of the dangers of that strategy: \"It is a matter of grave concern. It would prompt a split, but a split from the top.\"In this scenario Mrs May would probably be finished as PM.But I wonder if she has concluded, that her premiership, once Brexit is complete, is over anyway.I am struck by the language she used yesterday at the 1922 Committee, talking of doing \"the right thing for the country\".She may be preparing, psychologically and politically, for the ultimate compromise ahead. She might have concluded that in the end, the plaudits she is seeking are not from her party, but from history."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-bbc-gary-lineker-chris-evans_4359183.jpg?20180711145450 ","title":"ranked the bbcs top earning men and women","story":"Despite the huge salaries enjoyed by the men - including the likes of Eddie Mair and Simon Mayo, who both earn in excess of \u0026#163330,000, the BBC has argued that the list does not truly reflect the balance of payments.Overall, 64 of the BBC\u0027s on air stars earned more than \u0026#163150,000, compared to 58 in the previous financial year, with eight women having been added to the list - up to 22 - and two men knocked off - down to 42.The broadcaster said the split between the highest-earning men and women presenters had narrowed to 60:40 and has set a target of 50:50 by 2020."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-big-ben-elizabeth-tower_4359109.jpg?20180711132839 ","title":"st georges cross coming home to big ben as victorian colour scheme restored","story":"It is thought the current colour scheme was adopted early in the 20th century to get rid of the effects of decades of heavy air pollution on the Victorian building, which was designed by Charles Barry.Tom Brake, a Liberal Democrat MP and spokesman for the House of Commons Commission, said: \"The new colour scheme, it is not going to be dramatically different to what people see now.

Now even Big Ben has got into the spirit - with its world-famous clock tower to display the George Cross for the first time in almost a century. Parliamentary officials revealed the new design today as part of a \u0026pound61million refurbishment of the 1859 landmark. They insist the timing is just a coincidence, but it comes hours before the Three Lions\u0027 tie against Croatia. The six shields above each dial of the clock face have since the 1930s had a cross in black and gold, rather than the red and white of the England emblem. But as part of the refurbishment they will be restored to a red cross on a white background.  Commons officials insisted the other nations of the UK are represented because there are thistles, shamrocks and leeks also in the design. Adam Watrobski, Parliament’s Principal Architect said he was restoring the original colour scheme after studying paint samples, contemporary illustrations and photos. The dials and clock hands are Prussian blue and gold and the adjacent areas make use of the red, white and blue colours of the Union flag, he said. He added the intention was to restore the wishes of Charles Barry, the architect of the 19th Century Palace of Westminster.

The call comes after the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office (ICO) revealed that Facebook broke the law by failing to safeguard people\u0027s information and failing to be transparent about how people\u0027s data was harvested by others. The ICO also said it proposes to bring criminal action against SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica (CA). Darren Jones, the Labour MP for Bristol North West, raised the issue during Prime Ministers Questions today telling the Commons: The Information Commissioner has fined Facebook for its involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the Electoral Commission has concluded that the leave campaign broke electoral law.  Is now not the time to set up a judge-led inquiry into the Brexit referendum because if the British people have been duped by Brexit shysters they deserve to know about it. Matthew Elliott, the CEO of Vote Leave, the campaign headed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, took the highly unusual step of leaking the interim report of an Electoral Commission investigation which is still under way.  The draft report is understood to claim there was coordination between Vote Leave and a smaller campaign, BeLeave, which received a donation of more than \u0026pound600,000 in the closing weeks of the referendum, after advice from the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings.  This found the campaign guilty of breaking electoral rules and law. Mr Jones has argued that the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner did not have strong enough powers to deal with the breach at the time it was committed.  Facebook was fined \u0026pound500,000 for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, whereas under new laws it could have faced fines of up to half a billion dollars.  Speaking ahead of his intervention in the House of Commons, Mr Jones said: “The British people expect democratic elections to be legal. Voters have to weigh up the information they receive to decide how best to vote.

Naz Shah was one of four MPs promoted in a mini-reshuffle by Jeremy Corbyn last night as she became Shadow Equalities Minister.  The Bradford West MP was was stripped of the whip and barred from party activity for three months in 2016 during an investigation into a 2014 Facebook post.   She later rejoined the party after issuing a grovelling apology for sharing the post, which suggested Israel could move to America with the words: “problem solved”.  Another post on her page featured a plea for friends to support an online poll because the Jews are rallying.  At the time Ms Shah quit as an aide to John McDonnell, stepped aside from a Home Affairs Select Committee probe into anti-Semitism and later made public apologies at a synagogue and in the House of Commons.  But she was not initially suspended and the decision was only taken after then-Prime Minister David Cameron blasted the extraordinary bid to keep her in at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions.  Ms Shah later admitted she was ignorant about discrimination against Jews and won the support of a key body, the Board of Deputies of British Jews. President Jonathan Arkush said in January 2017: Naz Shah is one of the only people involved in Labour’s antisemitism crisis who has sought to make amends for her actions. For this we commend her and now regard Naz as a sincere friend of our community.

MPs fell into hysterics as Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s stand-in branded the Tory civil war Reservoir Dogs remade by the Chuckle Brothers at a fiesty PMQs . I may know very little about football, said the Shadow Foreign Secretary - who was once embroiled in a row for sneering at an England flag. But even I can see that England\u0027s progress so far in the World Cup shows what can be achieved when all the individual players work effectively as a team, when there\u0027s a clear game plan and when they\u0027re all working together and of course when everyone respects and listens to the manager. What lessons could the England team teach this shambles of a government?  Theresa May\u0027s deputy David Lidington prompted laughter at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions too - by insisting there was a “clear plan” with “full support of the squad”. He called on Labour to show its own plan for Brexit , which he claimed was the “best kept secret” in British politics. And he jokingly offered to buy the Islington South MP a St George\u0027s flag himself. But quoting the US President, Ms Thornberry said: Even Donald Trump can see they’re in turmoil - and he hasn’t even got to Britain yet.  PMQs was a rare battle of the deputies after Theresa May travelled to the NATO summit in Brussels. Mrs May was replaced by her deputy David Lidington , leading Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry to take Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s place for Labour. The pair clashed after Tory Brexiteers vowed guerrilla warfare and co-ordinated resignations to derail Theresa May\u0027s new, softer plan for Brexit. Theresa May agreed her plan at Chequers on Friday, prompting the resignation of Cabinet big beasts Boris Johnson and David Davis. Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to quit. The \u0027third way\u0027 plan for UK customs rules proposed keeping the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - and a possible compromise on migration. To appease Brexiteers, Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. But Brexiteers were enraged by this close link with Brussels and David Davis said this olive branch was meaningless in practice. The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, and agrees to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit. A full White Paper was due to be published on Thursday 12 July. Brexiteers say the plan to share EU rules on imported goods will run up the white flag and keep Britain chained to Brussels. But Labour Remainers currently oppose the plan too because they say that by not including services as well as goods, it doesn\u0027t go far enough. Ms Thornberry claimed the Chequers proposal was a total delusion, a half-baked customs union and a customs union in all but name - but without covering the vital services industry.

She might have added that ministers were behaving like crazy horses given that two of the Osmonds who sang that 1970s ditty were in the public gallery. Jay and Merrill Osmond had come to see Theresa May, and given that this was PMQs they had every expectation she would be starring in it.  But the PM was in Brussels wrestling with Donald Trump at the NATO summit and Jeremy Corbyn was putting his feet up. So Ms Thornberry deputised for the Labour leader and Mrs May\u0027s No2 David Lidington was standing in for the PM. He made a hash of it. Ms Thornberry said she could not see how frictionless trade could be maintained for the Irish border without the UK staying in the customs union. Mr Lidington told her to read the Government White Paper on the subject.  This was difficult for her as it is not published until tomorrow. Mr Lidington demanded Labour come up with an alternative to the White Paper Ms Thornberry has not yet seen. But then she already had. A customs union.

Kit Malthouse was put in charge of fixing Britain’s housing crisis in the Prime Minister’s frantic reorganisation on Monday night, following the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson. But despite being placed in charge of fixing Britain’s worst housing crisis for decades, Mr Malthouse intends to stay on as director of County Finance Group Ltd, the loan company he co-founded in 2001. Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary, John Healey said: “Fixing the housing crisis is a not a part-time job. “With home-ownership at a thirty-year low and homelessness spiralling upwards, the country deserves a full-scale commitment from the new Housing Minister.” Mr Malthouse rakes in \u0026pound40,000 a year plus \u0026pound10,000 worth of benefits working for the firm, on top of his \u0026pound76,000 MPs salary and \u0026pound31,000 ministerial bonus. He declared the job on the Register of Members’ Interests, noting that he expected to perform around 10 hours’ work for the company a month - making his time worth a whopping \u0026pound333 an hour.  Mr Malthouse told Commons authorities he was giving up his role as chairman of the firm in March, when he took a job as a welfare minister. But his declared pay and benefits did not change and the company’s website still lists him as Chairman, noting that he had combined his business life with a career in politics.  Mr Malthouse is the only MP with a ministerial job to hold a paid directorship at the same time as their government role. Ministers were required to give up any paid or unpaid directorships under the ministerial code of conduct until 2010, when the requirement was quietly removed under David Cameron. Mrs May’s decision to appoint Mr Malthouse Housing Minister has already sparked anger, after the Mirror revealed he had admitted he made life “uncomfortable” for the homeless as part of a zero-tolerance crackdown.

Rachel Beaufoy, was preparing to dance the night away after marrying love of her life, Paul. The couple had said their vows at the Sandy Cove Hotel in Devon before disaster struck and her gown burst into flames. After lighting sparklers with family and friends outside the venue, Rachel, 33, was heading back inside to carry on the celebrations. But as she stopped to chat to a friend, the mother of two smelled burning coming from close by. And as she turned around to locate the smell, the blushing bride discovered the bottom of her dress was on fire and her legs felt as if they were burning. Rachel, a resourcer for a utility company, said: I immediately started screaming and panicking. My dress was fully on fire, and I had my little girl in my arms, and I didn\u0027t know what to do.   Bride and groom\u0027s big moment takes strange turn as England score World Cup goal at the worst possible time  We tried to put it out by wafting it but it just made it worse. I thought I was going to lose my legs. Close friend, Carl, offered to pour his pint of lager over Rachel but the traumatised bride managed to extinguish the blaze herself before it spread any further. Rachel, who is mother to Megan, five and Jack, three, married her fianc\u0026eacute Paul, 36, at The Sandy Cove Hotel in Devon in September last year. The couple, who have been together 15 years, began planning their big day in 2015, after the birth of their second child, Jack. After getting hitched on a cliff top overlooking the ocean, Rachel, and new husband Paul, a builder, celebrated with their guests. Everything went swimmingly but at 9:30pm they realised they\u0027d forgotten to light the sparklers, something they\u0027d been planning into their wedding for months.   World Cup-loving bride watches England football match while making her marriage vows  Rachel said: We\u0027d had our first dance and were having loads of fun with our friends and family but we realised we\u0027d forgotten about the sparklers. We headed outside to light them all and made some fun shapes in the dark and once they were all out we went back inside to carry on dancing. As I was making my way back in, I stopped to have a chat with my friend. I noticed she had a little burn mark on her dress and she said one of the sparklers had managed to catch it. It was really strange because as soon as I mentioned this I began to smell burning. I had no idea where it was coming from at first and then I began to feel my legs getting hot. It felt like they were burning and when I turned around the bottom of my dress was on fire! Rachel, who was carrying her little girl, Megan, began to scream and panic. She recalls: My mum came out and was screaming Paul was panicking, he had Jack in his arms and Jack was crying it was just awful.   Bride and groom fear no one will show up to wedding - because of England clash  I was wearing a corset dress so I was never going to be able to take it off before the flames spread. My friend was about to pour a pint over me, and mum was saying we should roll me down the hill to put the flames out. Luckily, due to some quick thinking, Rachel and her friends were able to extinguish the fire by frantically patting it down, but her dress was ruined. Rachel said: I was shaking and could barely walk by the time we managed to put it out. My legs felt like they were on fire, and my mum was left so traumatised that she had to go to bed. I really thought I was going to lose my legs, but luckily and by some kind of miracle, they didn\u0027t have a mark on them. Paul was completely distraught and didn\u0027t understand how it could\u0027ve happened.

We missed Harry Maguire’s opening goal, but we made it back in time to see Dele Alli head us into tomorrow night’s semi-final in Moscow.  The boys were so happy I thought they would burst. They were screaming, jumping on the sofas and hugging each other so much anyone would have thought they were in the winning team. What made the moment so poignant for me was the fact that Joshua’s friends are all from such diverse backgrounds – Ghana, India, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, England –and they were all united behind the national team. I was surprised to get WhatsApp messages from family in America telling me they are backing England all the way. And later that evening driving past an England fan waving a huge St George’s Flag in South London, my aunty insisted on rolling down the car window and shouting, “Come on, England” in her loudest Accra accent and beeping my car horn. “Yeah!” he screamed back.   This talented England team under manager Gareth Southgate have brought the country together in a way I’ve never seen before.  It made me think back to when I was my son’s age. Would I, aged 12, in the late 1980s ever have sat down with my friends to cheer on the England football team? No I wouldn’t.  Growing up in South London, I feared English football fans and the English flag they brandished so menacingly. The St George’s Cross was hijacked by extreme nationalist groups such as the BNP and National Front which used it as their emblem.  For me, my family and friends it signified that, to many people in this country, we weren’t welcome. My memory of English fans then was as drunken, rampaging yobs who felt it was acceptable to hurl vile racist abuse at their own players.  John Barnes has spoken about the abuse he faced on the pitch. The former England player, who had a banana thrown at him during a 1988 FA Cup tie at Everton, said: “Any black player of my generation had it. In 1984 with England in Brazil, I had it with the National Front. There wasn’t a game in the Eighties when you didn’t get racial abuse as a black player.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher refuses move school play","story":"NewsSchool refuses to move play for England game - so parents will have to watch Shrek the Musical insteadParents of Year 5 and 6 children at Pucklechurch Primary School in Bristol are outraged by the headteacher\u0027s decision\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience WriterTristan Cork15:06, 11 JUL 2018Updated15:32, 11 JUL 2018NewsPucklechurch Primary School\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailExcitement is building and England fans across the country are counting down the minutes until Gareth Southgate\u0027s England squad take to the pitch for the World Cup semi-final. It\u0027s the first time the Three Lions have reached this stage in the competition since 1990, and people are starting to believe it really is finally coming home  While most big events have been rearranged or rescheduled so they don\u0027t clash with the big match, one primary school is refusing to move their play, reports Bristol Live .  This means children and their parents will miss England go head-to-head with Croatia - and will instead be transported to Fairytale Land for their production of Shrek the Musical.  Year 5 and 6 children at Pucklechurch Primary School in Bristol will take to the stage bang on 7pm for their production. About 50 children have spent the past month getting ready for the production ahead of two performances - one last night and one this evening. Parents are outraged that headteacher David Forrester has refused to move the start time. One parent, who asked not to be name for fear of the fall-out, said parents were flabbergasted when they arrived at school on Monday, expecting the show to be rescheduled. She said: Everyone assumed after England won on Saturday that the headteacher would postpone Wednesday\u0027s show. Or at least, arrange it to be on earlier on Wednesday, or move it to Thursday.  There\u0027s so many ways round it - the whole nation is coming to a standstill for this, other major sporting events are being changed, but not Shrek the Musical at little Pucklechurch Primary School, it\u0027s absolutely crazy. Parents were further angered when David told pupils if they intended to pull out of Wednesday\u0027s production to watch the football, they would be replaced for Tuesday\u0027s show, too. One said: He threatened all the children that if they \u0027don\u0027t come tomorrow night they will be letting the whole school down\u0027. All the year 5 and 6s are upset, I\u0027ve got a child that\u0027s upset about it.  Parents took to a closed Facebook group for parents and grandparents at the school, where one parent labelled the headteacher\u0027s actions \u0027very petty and childish\u0027.  Another said: This whole thing is shocking.  My child is really upset. I feel like she\u0027s been emotionally blackmailed. But David said he saw no reason to change the time or date of the production.  He told Bristol Live number of pupils had dropped out of the production so they could watch the match, and it was only fair to those still involved that they did so.  He said: Why would we change the time or date? We have had a couple of parents who have expressed their concerns about it, but we\u0027d sorted all of this out on Tuesday by giving those children and parents who wanted to watch the football the option of dropping out. It makes it manageable and fair for all if the same children who are committed to the production on Wednesday appear on both nights.

Stunned inspectors discovered the animals living in horrendous conditions at the property in Lincolnshire.  In one disgusting case, a pig that had eaten a bucket of rat poison was found dead, reports Lincolnshire Live .  And the terrible treatment of animals there only came to light after some pigs escaped. Now the case has been prosecuted in court and images of what inspectors discovered there have been revealed.  At Peterborough Magistrates’ Court, it was heard that an officer at the RSPCA was increasingly concerned after visiting Maxine Cammock’s home in Bourne in October 2017. After returning some pigs that had escaped, RSPCA inspector Kate Burris was left horrified by the condition some of the animals were living in – many of whom were dead. She said: “I went to Cammock’s home in October last year after a call from a police officer who had been involved in rounding up a number of escaped pigs and returning them to her. “The officer was extremely concerned by what he had seen, and rang us.  “It is a large property with several buildings on site. There were the remains of dead animals everywhere, most in such a state of decomposition it was impossible to establish how they had died. “Several collie type dogs were in a shocking state in filthy pens in one of the buildings. Two of the dogs were dead, one in a pen with two other dogs, Julie and Martin. “A pig who had eaten a bucket of rat poison was dead in another of the buildings. Cammock realised what the pig had done and, rather than seek vet treatment, locked him inside.”  Only twenty-five animals were found alive and were immediately removed. However, a month later even more animals were found in distress including chickens who had been packed into plastic containers with the lids weighted down. A total of 55 eggs had been hatched and the chicks were seen living in cardboard boxes and containers. Cammock, 54, was taken to court where she pleaded guilty to five offences contrary to the Animal Welfare Act 2006 relating to a total of nine dogs, a pig, ten chickens and 55 chicks. Two offences contrary to the Animal By Products (Enforcement) England Regulations 2013 were dropped.

This is a very special relationship between two proud sovereign countries.  “We share common values, culture, business links, family ties and possibly a similar sense of humour. “Our relationship is of course informed by our history but it is also one which is now dynamic and forward-looking. “This evening, we are extremely fortunate to be joined by many of those who are shaping future of Ireland. You embody the energy which characterises this amazing country. “I have the greatest confidence the friendship, collaboration and mutual understanding that our two countries have built up over the years will endure and it will grow. “I will finish by drawing on the words of President Higgins during his extraordinarily successful visit to the UK in 2014 for which we still remember with admiration.

We shield each other and rely on each other for shelter.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mums horror after man 70s","story":"NewsMum\u0027s horror after man in 70s tells four-year-old daughter he\u0027d \u0027give her one\u0027 in streetThe mum-of-two was cradling the youngster while walking with her other seven-year-old child outside some shops when the man made the comment\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKatie Timms13:02, 11 JUL 2018NewsThe man in his 70s was \u0027spoken to\u0027 by Devon and Cornwall Police officers after his shocking comments about the four-year-old (Image: PlymouthLive/ WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn elderly man told a four-year-old girl he would give her one while she was carried by her mum down a street.

He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters wounds.  Emma said that she joined the train mid-route before it terminated at London Victoria. She described the other passengers as a nice, quiet bunch of people. Mr Boon is Head of Network Operations at GTR (Govia Thameslink Railway), which operates Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern, and the Gatwick Express. His LinkedIn profile boasts of a career history spanning nearly 30 years that combines successful project management and day to delivery. He was crowned \u0027Customer Service Manager of the Year\u0027 while working for South West Trains in 2015. And within 24 hours of sharing the photo, Emma\u0027s tweet had been shared 350 times - with plenty of outraged Twitter users sharing their disdain.  Richie Northcote wrote: Disgusting. There’s going to be some kind of commuter/passenger revolt soon, I can feel it bubbling. The disgraceful service us regular commuters have to deal with would simply not be tolerated in any other country - and this guy is just rubbing salt in sore wounds. And Twitter account GoblinUsers, of Barking and Gospel Oak Rail Users\u0027 Group, said: Having had dealings with him in a past life when he was a station manager around 2003, I am shocked and amazed to see him in such a senior position. It certainly helps explain why GTR is such a useless outfit. I do feel sorry for the staff who work for him.

Ellie Campbell, a first year psychology student, was with a group of friends from her halls of residence on Friday January 26, an inquest heard. The Canterbury Christ Church University students visited a number of bars, including a Wetherspoon pub and The Jolly Sailor before moving onto Club Chemistry. An inquest into the teenager’s death held at Archbishop’s Palace yesterday heard how Ellie went outside the nightclub at around 1.30am on January 27 and told her friend she wanted to leave, reports KentLive . The 18-year-old, originally from Basildon in Essex, then returned to her accommodation at St George’s Centre at around 2am.  Det Sgt Nicky Holland-Day said: “She said she was not feeling very well and was going back to the halls. “She had drank a mojito pitcher and four double vodkas through the night. She was described as sobering up but a bit down. “Ellie had her friend’s phone in her bag. They tried to call her but couldn’t hear if the call connected because of the noise in the club. “The girls would normally go home together so this was unusual.” DS Holland-Day explained how Ellie had greeted one of the security guards at the halls with a hug instead of her “usual fist bump” but they noticed “nothing to alert them”. Ellie’s friend arrived back at the halls at around 2.30am and knocked on her fourth floor room door to retrieve her phone but there was no answer and it was locked. The friend fetched security and they gained access to the room where Ellie was found hanging in the shower room. Eight paramedics rushed to the scene to help Ellie before she was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford in a critical condition. Sadly, a CT scan later revealed that her brain activity was “incompatible with life” and the heartbreaking decision to remove her support was made.

The inquest heard how Ellie had 296mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood – the legal drink-drive limit is 80 – but had no history of self-harm and no known mental health conditions. DS Holland-Day added: “There was no note and no indication she was considering suicide. Her mood had changed from a bubbly one to a sombre one. “But I am unable to determine why this popular young girl would end her life. It’s devastating. “The case is unusual. She had made friends really easily, very good relationships. She normally felt able to discuss anything going on. “There was no indication to them that there were any issues to be concerned about.” Assistant coroner Katrina Hepburn recorded a conclusion of suicide and passed on her condolences to Ellie’s family and friends.

Talitha Beales, 19, started screaming hysterically one year ago today when she saw the infant - umbilical cord still attached - on the concrete floor of a bus shelter in Towyn, in north Wales. The mother of the baby never came forward despite repeated appeals by North Wales Police and Conwy county council, reports the Daily Post . The little girl was put into foster care and Talitha, who does not even know her name, thinks about her every day.  Talitha has revealed how much she’d love to know she is doing after admitting she and her family were told nothing about the child’s progress after she was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. The 19-year-old said: “After the baby was taken away in the ambulance, we never saw her again. “We were desperate for information about how she was doing. We just wanted to know she was OK. “My dad really wanted to go in and see her, even just to give her a teddy, but we weren’t allowed. “I’d love to know her first name and that she’s in a happy home. “I do think about her a lot. “I’m just glad we found her when we did because she came very close to dying.”  Talitha was being driven home to Stoke-on-Trent after spending time in North Wales with her dad, Daniel Braxton when she made the grim discovery. She said: “I remember every detail about the day like it was yesterday. “It’s something I will never forget. “As dad drove past the bus stop, I saw the baby covered in blood, it still had the umbilical cord attached and I thought it was dead. “I told my dad to stop the car, he thought it was a prank and carried on, but I started screaming my head off hysterically until he stopped and turned back. “I stayed in the car because I didn’t want to look. My dad was reluctant at first, he thought it was a doll or a sick joke until he realised it was a real baby. “She was cold and lifeless and my dad ran to get a dressing gown from the car to wrap around her after calling for help.  “The ambulance and police came and taped the area off. “We have always wondered about her ever since.” Speaking to the Daily Post at the time, Daniel said: “She (the baby) was a fair size, I’d say probably around the seven pound mark. “She was not tiny, but definitely newborn as she still had the umbilical cord on. “I gave her a few hard rubs on her chest to see if there was any life in her, and at that point she gave a big gasp and opened her eyes.” He added: “As I waited for the ambulance I was just cuddling her, telling her everything was going to be all right. Not that she could understand me, but I just thought she need to hear a comforting voice.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather met office issues","story":"NewsUK weather: Met Office issues yellow warning for flooding, thunderstorms and heavy downpours to end heatwave on FridayThundery showers are posing a flooding risk and dangerous driving condition for large parts of the UK\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy Coles15:14, 11 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHeavy downpours and thunderstorms will bring an end to the heatwave on Friday and could see flooding in large parts of the country. The Met Office have issued a yellow weather warning for thunder for south east England and Wales with some locations set to get 2cm of rain in just an hour. Friday will start of dry and fine for much of the country but rising temperatures will usher in thunder and lightening by late morning. The warning is in place from 11am to 8pm when forecasters expect the weather will clear and be largely dry overnight. There is a risk of flooding and forecasters are warning drivers to expect hazardous conditions on the roads.  A Met Office spokesperson said: On Thursday it\u0027s a dry day across England. There will be much more in the way of dry weather, in the north west especially, but still little a bit of rain across Northern Ireland and Scotland. London will see temperatures of 26C - 27C. Moving north it will be between 22C and 26C and in Scotland around 17C or 18C.  Friday will be a fine day for many. The north east will be quite clear with sunshine. But moving into late morning rising temperatures will bring scattered heavy showers particularly in the south west. People can expect risk of flooding and those driving, spray and surface waters on the roads. There is a risk of lightening strikes hitting and damaging the power supply to services. This will gradually move away in the evening. The warning comes after forecasters warned 2018 will see the hottest summer ever recorded following weeks of sizzling temperatures.  Brits have flocked to beaches, parks and swimming pools to soak up the sun in recent weeks that\u0027s been so strong it\u0027s smashed a series of records. Sunday July 8 was the hottest day of the year so far with Gosport in Hampshire recording a temperature of 32.4C. Moving into the weekend, on Saturday there will be some cloud and chances of showers across the country, meaning it will feel a lot cooler.

Larissa Bell, 21, was filmed waving her arms in the air and wiggling her hips as she stood on top of the emergency vehicle last Saturday. The restaurant worker, from Glasgow, was reportedly spending the weekend in the capital with pals when the shocking scenes unfolded.  She was cheered on by football fans as she allegedly trampled on the ambulance\u0027s bonnet and windscreen before dancing on top of it.  Other supporters were also seen mounting the car, including a woman who flashed her bra and a Gareth Southgate lookalike.  The vehicle was damaged and forced off the road for repairs after being jumped on by revellers during the celebrations, police said.  When approached at her Scottish home by The Sun , Larissa reportedly admitted climbing on the ambulance while it was parked.  She replied yes when asked whether she had done so. Police had earlier put out a plea for information about the incident, which occurred in the aftermath of England\u0027s victory over Sweden. They tweeted out a picture of Larissa on Sunday, with the message: “London Ambulance Service would like to identify this individual who jumped up and down on one of their response cars yesterday.”  They said the vehicle had been left damaged and required repairs. Earlier this week, a local policing team in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, revealed they knew who the woman was, tweeting: Identified. They added: Now it\u0027s our turn. Larissa is believed to work as a waitress. This morning, Scotland Yard confirmed to  that no arrests have been made following the incident.

It was taken off the road after excited members of the crowd took it in turns to mount the bonnet following England\u0027s 2-0 win .

The 47-year-old from Edenbridge, Kent then popped the ring inside the balloon. However, things went pear-shaped when she she turned around to fetch something to weigh down the 36-inch inflatable.

For 17 long days the Wild Boars squad, aged between 11 and 17, were stuck in the Tham Luang cave system in the province of Chiang Rai after an excursion with their coach went horribly wrong. Their ordeal finally came to an end after a dangerous three-day rescue mission by a brave group of more than 90 divers. And it has now emerged that one of the boys played a crucial role in saving his friends\u0027 lives. 14-year-old Adul Sam-on had a difficult start in life after being born into a stateless tribe known for drug-trafficking.  But determined to give him a better life, his parents fled to Thailand when he was six. He started school and became a top pupil, and before long his academic and sporting achievements landed him a scolarship. Among other things he\u0027s learnt over the years, he\u0027s fluent in FIVE languages - English, Thai, Burmese, Mandarin and Wa  And it was these language skills which would save his life, and the lives of his teammates and football coach, when the group became trapped in the cave, reports the New York Times .   When the British divers arrived, brave Adul was able to act as a translator and politely told them their biggest need - food. He was also able to tell the divers how long they had been stuck down there. The boys have all been rescued but even though they\u0027re now safe they are still receiving urgent medical care. They lost an average of 4lbs each and are being monitored for infections.

The 8.6ft long gothic-looking coffin was dug up in a dig in the city of Alexandria, on the northern coast of Egypt and is the biggest ever to be found in the city. It was found over 16ft deep in the ground and buried along side a white, alabaster, stone head - thought to be the occupant of the sarcophagus. According to the archaeologists the black granite sarcophagus stands at 185 centimeters tall (6 feet), 265cm long (8.6 ft), and 165 cm wide (5.4 ft). The discovery has stunned the archaeologists who stumbled on the ancient find while clearing the site for a new building.  Under Egyptian law all sites must be excavated before being built on. It\u0027s thought to date to the Ptolemaic period, which lasted roughly 300 years from 332-30 BCE, making it at least 2,000 years old, Sciencealert reports . Ayman Ashmawy from the Egypt Ministry of Antiquities said an intact layer of mortar lying between the lid of the coffin and the body suggests it has never been opened since it was buried thousands of years ago. The team of experts will now work to establish exactly what\u0027s inside.  Recently, archaeologists unearthed a 2,200 year old coin which depicted the head of ancient king, King Ptolemy III - an ancestor of Cleopatra.  In Southern Egypt archaeologists discovered a rare marble head depicting Roman Emperor Aurelius.  Ancient Egyptian finds have also included the burial site of 40 mummies discovered in Minya, south of Cairo, earlier this year. Alongside the 40 mummies were pieces of jewellery, pottery and masks.

Irina Malysheva was allegedly attacked with a broken glass outside a cafe bar after she asked another punter to delete a video clip of her singing. She claims her attacker broke the glass on her head and cut her cheek open with it in a bar in Apsheronsk, Krasnodar Krai, Russia.

You play for the glory and to win things.“If you are asked, you would say you would love to leave a legacy and Gillie has certainly done that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434788ba270-719x564.jpg ","title":"a true legend dundee fc league winner pays tribute to exceptional dark blues and tottenham striker alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exceptional striker and a lovely man who was never changed by stardom.That’s how Dundee legend Alan Gilzean is described by fellow Dens Park great and championship winning team-mate Bob Seith.Gilzean died on Sunday at the age of 79, less than a month after it was revealed he was battling a brain tumour.It was a sad day for Seith, one of four surviving members of the Dark Blues greatest-ever side, but he was able to recall the many happy memories of his friend and colleague.“It’s sad news and my thoughts are with Alan’s family,” he said.“I was just thinking about him the other day and wondering how he was, so it’s sad to hear of his passing.”Recalling their time together, what Seith highlighted first was Gilzean’s superstar status on the park was matched by being a class act off it.“Alan was an exceptional striker for Dundee and Tottenham, but that never changed him. He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44846f6daa4-752x564.jpg ","title":"bbc radio 4 listening project broadcasts from dundee this week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA radio project which is collecting stories from the public is being hosted by the city’s Verdant Works all this weekThe award-winning former jute mill at West Henderson’s Wynd, now a popular visitor attraction, is temporarily home to BBC Radio 4’s The Listening Project from 10am-5pm until Friday and local residents are being invited to stop off and make their own contributions.A mobile unit is parked at Verdant Works, where the public can share their stories on life, moments, memories and people – whatever they choose.By taking part they will also be creating history.

And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

Almost all the teams use it as part of their pre-season but we want to do well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8046268.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"job-ad-seeks-candidate-to-play-golf-and-eat-and-drink-across-scotland","story":"                          A UNIQUE job advertisement is sure to be a big hit with sporting fans this week."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8051068.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-city-council-responds-to-ban-orange-walk-petition","story":"                          GLASGOW City Council said its officers are set to meet this week \u0026ldquoas it\u0027 perhaps time to review our procedures after a hate crime attack on a Catholic priest during the Orange Walk."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8050685.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"custom-house-to-be-at-the-centre-of-new-90m-redevelopment-in-glasgow","story":"                          HISTORIC A-listed Custom House will be the centre of a new hotel and leisure development in Glasgow city centre."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-school-of-art-demolition-begins","story":"                          BRICK by brick dismantling work has begun to take down sections of the Mackintosh Building after it suffered a second fire in the last four years."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8052133.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"fc-alashkert-0-celtic-3-no-drama-for-brendan-rodgers-men-in-armenia","story":"                          NO Imps, no Buckfast bottle thrown, no drama, no real problem."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8000506.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"orange-walk-in-glasgow-evening-times-readers-have-their-say","story":"                          THE majority of Evening Times readers have said they do not want to see Orange Walks banned in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"comedian-nick-hall-turns-life-of-spencer-percival-into-tale-for-edinburgh-fringe","story":"                          COMEDIAN Nick Hall is coming to the Fringe with his play based on the life - and death \u0026ndash of Spencer Percival. \u0026ldquoSpencer who?

cause.Although official accounts stated the 80-year-old peer, nicknamed the Old Fox, was buried at the Tower of London, the clan always maintained supporters had intercepted his body and spirited it back to his homeland.But a forensic investigation led by renowned forensic anthropologist Dame Professor Sue Black sent out shockwaves earlier this year when it was discovered the remains were those of an unknown 25-year-old woman plus four others, including a child.They will all be reinterred in the crypt on Thursday, August 23 during a service attended by Lovat Fraser family members and others

dignity and include prayers for the dead led by Father Maximilian Nwosu of St Mary\u0027 RC Church in Beauly. Her son will also play a lament on Lovat Fraser pipes.But Mrs Fraser acknowledged the mystery surrounding the headless skeleton remained as they still did not know who the woman was or why she was missing her head.\"That is life,\" she reflected. \"How many things in life get closure?

There is absolutely no reason why we cannot be even stronger again in the upcoming season.“The gaffer has already added to the squad this summer by taking in three new signings.“Those three are good additions to the squad and I am sure there will be another two or three before the season starts.”McInnes has already signed three midfielders with £200,000 outlaid to secure Chris Forrester, 25, from Peterborough United on a three-year contract until 2021.Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson, 29, was secured on a free having left Ipswich Town at the end of last season.Capped four times, Gleeson signed a two-year deal at Pittodrie until summer 2020.The Dons were today set to discover the extent of a knee injury sustained by Gleeson in the recent 2-2 friendly draw at St Johnstone.Gleeson was set to undergo a scan on Monday but that was put back 24 hours to allow the swelling on the knee to subside.The Dons boss faces a sweat on the extent of Gleeson’s injury and whether he will be fit to face Burnley in the Euro opener.Teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson arrived from Hamilton.The two clubs failed to agree a figure for training compensation for the 18-year-old.Aberdeen offered in excess of £100,000 but Hamilton are understood to value compensation for developing Ferguson through their youth academy scheme at around the £900,000 mark.The matter is set to go to SPFL arbitration with a date yet to be decided for the tribunal.Aberdeen are confident the figure will be closer to their valuation.McInnes aims to bring in a striker and a defender, ideally a full-back, before the UEFA signing deadline of Friday July 20 for the second qualifying round.However, there remains the provision to sign two “wildcards” beyond that deadline up until 24 hours before the first leg – which would be 7.45pm on Wednesday July 25.Aberdeen had a bid rejected for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis who has netted 41 goals in the previous two seasons.It is understood that bid was for £250,000 and McInnes has confirmed the offer that was rejected was the highest they were likely to go to and the Dons will now look at other options.McGinn said: “Under the manager we look to continually get stronger and keep improving.”The emergence of January signing Mikey Devlin during pre-season is essentially a summer signing. Centre-back Devlin signed in January but was still undergoing rehabilitation from a cruciate ligament injury.He is fully fit and has impressed in pre-season having made his debut six months after signing in the 1-0 defeat of Cobh Ramblers.“It is great to see Mikey back after 13 months out,” said McGinn.The pre-season and signing activity are geared towards that Euro opener against the Clarets.McGinn added: “We got a good draw in Europe and have plenty to look forward to in the upcoming weeks.“We aim to really kick

strikes over wages","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlanned strikes at Aberdeen’s airport could cripple services during its busiest season, a union boss warned today.More than half the 252-strong workforce at Aberdeen International Airport are expected to strike after 88% of workers rejected the latest pay offer.Aberdeen airport workers vote for strike action over payThe move could see around 170 workers taking part in industrial action, including security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters and passenger service agents.A series of 24-hour stoppages are planned to take place on July 20, August 2 and August 16 but a spokeswoman for the airport maintained they would be ready to deal with any planned strikes.Mediator Acas has been contacted to lead discussions between the two parties, with the airport seeking a suitable date for these to continue.Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace said the strikes would affect the running of the airport at the height of the summer holiday season.He said: “It would have a big effect because the people taking the action are key to the running of the airport.“I could see the airport not being able to run on those days because a lot of key people would be striking.“It could be a busy time for the airport as it’s July and August it’s pencilled in for, so unfortunately it would have an impact on the public.”The airport employs its own firefighters but it is understood replacements could be drafted in from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to plug the gap.However, the airport could not confirm how many firefighters it employs or what contingency arrangements would be in place.Unite said operations at the heliport would not be affected under any industrial action.Unite members have now rejected two wage offers over the two previous years.Mr Wallace added that the latest pay offer has been “emphatically rejected” by Unite members.He said: “The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding their hard-working employees is by offering more real-term pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.“It’s high time for the company to invest in their employees.“Unite remain open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.”An Aberdeen Airport spokesman said: “We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday July 20.“This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer.“We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.“We have made contact with Acas, which has agreed to mediate between both parties.“We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.“We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”A TUI spokesman, which operates flights to and from the airport, said staff are “working closely” with the airport to “understand the situation”.He added: “We would like to reassure customers that we will do everything possible to minimise disruption should the industrial action take place.”In 2016, a potential strike by Aberdeen Airport workers over pensions was averted after talks between union bosses and airport chiefs resulted in an “agreement in principle”.There were fears industrial action could lead to major disruption at the north-east gateway at the height of the summer season.The airport recently unveiled a much bigger and improved security hall, as well as new shops and a larger duty free section as part of a £20 million investment at the terminal.Work on a third phase is already under way and will deliver new and bigger catering facilities, with bosses hoping it will be finished in time for Offshore Europe 2019.The Duchess of Rothesay officially opened phase one last October, which saw the creation of a new international arrivals hall and baggage reclaim area.Airport bosses spent nearly four years designing the development to minimise the impact the work on the terminal’s transformation would have on passengers.Easyjet said it could not comment until it received notice of strike action.Flybe, British Airways and Thomas Cook could not be reached for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b407e2c0acc3-846x564.jpg ","title":"car parking and gritters given space as operations

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Steve the Seagull sneakily snatches a bag of crisps from bakery giant Greggs in Ayr. The sly bird checks to see if the coast is clear and grabs a packet of Walkers if staff are busy – and he’s tried every flavour. Greggs team member Charley Cooper said: “He could be in three times a day. He always goes for the crisps on the bottom shelf. He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place. I shout ‘Steve’ and he flys off.” Hilariously the staff have dubbed the winged bandit ‘Steve Segal’ after the action movie actor.  Charley said the popular pest has been causing a flap for about two years. Air traffic controller Steve McNamara made a video of the bird in action last Tuesday. The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny. It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous. I had a feeling the bird wasn’t a first offender and it looked like it knew exactly what it was doing. It was a snatch theft.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3294074.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS33570090.jpg","title":"up your game face boot","story":"NewsUp your game or face the boot - shock SNP ultimatum to South Ayrshire Council leaderIt comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:21, 10 JUL 2018NewsCouncil leader Douglas Campbell (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp your game or face the boot. That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"up-to-50-jobs-created-with-new-home-bargains-store-in-galashiels","story":"UP to 50 jobs are being created with the opening of a new \u0026pound4million Home Bargains store in Galashiels this weekend.\nThe Stirling Street outlet, which is due to be opened on Saturday at 8am, replaces the smaller Channel Street store which closes the day before.\nJoe Morris, operations director at Home Bargains, told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore thrilled to be launching this flagship store in Galashiels and look forward to welcoming customers through the doors.\nThe 25,000 sq ft store, which has previously been a Co-Op and B\u0026ampM, will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.\nJoe added: \u0026ldquoStirling Street will be a great location for us and we\u0026rsquore proud to be able to offer local people top-branded goods at exceptionally low prices.\nWith more than four million customers each week, Home Bargains is one of the country\u0026rsquos best-loved discount retailers, stocking top-quality branded goods at low prices.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"feature-peebles-pupils-meditate-their-way-to-mindfulness","story":"IT\u0027S a typical weekday, high school students are lying on the floor of their classroom, eyes closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control? They\u0026rsquod disembarked at station 108, where Peeblesshire\u0026rsquos very own princess of peace resides.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"eildon-achieve-excellence-in-quality-management","story":"MANAGEMENT at Eildon Housing have been recognised for achieving excellence.\nStaff from the Selkirk-based provider were awarded four stars by the European Foundation for Quality Management.\nAnd they have managed to reach pass marks in all nine Excellence Model criteria set by the Foundation within three years.\nEildon\u0026rsquos chief executive Nile Istephan is delighted with the award.\nHe told us: \u0026ldquoThis is another fantastic recognition for the work of the Eildon Group and all of our staff who work hard to deliver ever improving services to our customers.\n\"To have achieved such a speedy progression through this demanding framework in only three years is a great achievement and we are very proud of our colleagues for their efforts.\n\"This award demonstrates our continuing focus on business improvement, building on the organisation\u0026rsquos strengths to attain even higher levels of excellence throughout our entire operation and we are absolutely delighted to receive four-star recognition.\"\nEildon are currently beginning a record-breaking expansion programme of house-building across the Borders.\nThe Quality Management award was made at the recent Scottish Business Awards.\nClaire Ford, chief executive officer of Quality Scotland added: \"Eildon Housing Association\u0026rsquos achievement of Recognised for Excellence Four Star, in their first assessment, is a clear demonstration of an organisation\u0026rsquos drive and desire to achieve sustainable business excellence and truly embed a culture of continuous improvement.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scary-start-to-sun-kissed-earlston-civic-week","story":"DON\u0027T expect too many crows to drop in on this year\u0027s Earlston Civic Week.\nTo herald the start of this week\u0027s fun-packed festival scarecrows have been placed all entrances to the town as well as a few locations around the centre.\nAnd they will stay there until the Civic Week conclusion this weekend.\nVillagers have already enjoyed a day of pub games at the Red Lion as well as a ramble, car treasure hunt and a football tournament during the weekend.\nAnd on Monday the ever-popular pet show took place at the Cauldie beneath beautiful blue skies, along with a duck race and barbecue.\nLast (Tuesday) night athletes of all ages and abilities tackled the Black Hill in roasting hot temperatures.\nAnd throughout this afternoon a children\u0027s party will be held in the grand marquee, followed in the evening by the hotly contested quiz.\nEarlston\u0027s annual celebrations conclude this weekend with a Senior Citizens\u0027 bash in the marquee on Friday, followed by Scocha in concert and a late-night disco.\nAnd tomorrow the fabulous fancy dress parade takes place on Saturday afternoon ahead of the sports, torchlight parade and fireworks.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-water-urge-borderers-to-use-less-water-during-heatwave","story":"SCOTTISH Water is urging Borderers to use water wisely to help maintain supplies while the country basks in a prolonged heatwave.\nFollowing a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage for water has increased significantly.\nWith the current warm weather conditions forecast to continue, Scottish Water bosses are encouraging people to take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.\nIn some areas there has been a 30 percent increase in demand for water during the summer so far and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day to meet current customer usage.\nScottish Water has been monitoring the situation closely and are managing supplies across the country, including deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.\nSome water treatment works and distribution networks are also working at near capacity to meet demand.\nAverage reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year, but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.\nThe main advice for Borderers is to reduce water usage wherever possible.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p.

Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.

A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.

Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.

The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf. Hopefully by working with Scottish Golf and local clubs we can capitalise on this legacy for many years to come."},{"url":null,"title":"picture-gallery-haddington-show","story":"  From stunt horses to showjumping, face painting and\u0026nbspfree doggy health checks, there was something for all members of the family to join in.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

The football coach, whose team take on Croatia today for a place in the World Cup final in Russia, has propelled the clothing item without which no three-piece suit would be complete back back into the fashion limelight thanks to his smart appearance on the touchline.  And with England fans adopting the garment as their personal talisman in their hunt for football glory, it has now emerged that Mr Southgate\u0027s waistcoat is to be preserved for the nation with The Museum of London announcing plans to acquire one his suits as part of their permanent collection.  Joining treasures from around the world, the plan is to display the garment at the museum\u0027s new building in the north of London.  Beatrice Behlen, Museum of London Senior Fasion Curator said:\"The Museum of London has a large fashion collection with garments ranging from the 16th century to the present.  \"Our earliest waistcoat dates from the late 17th century, our most recent from 2014. This acquisition would be a fantastic addition to our holdings and would come at an exciting time for us while we build the London Collection as we plan the New Museum in West Smithfield.\"  The traditional three piece suit - trousers, jacket and waistcoat - was a key part of British fashion for centuries, with an integral role in men\u0026rsquos wardrobes until the 1960s.  However, they have since fallen out of fashion with the rise of a more business-casual look.  But the history of the waistcoat actually predates the business suit by several centuries, with the first example, which had sleeves, recorded by the 17th century writer and politician Samuel Pepys.  Pepys, a regular at the royal court, recorded that King Charles II intended to set a new fashion with a \"vest\", which he would wear the next day.  While not quite a vest in the modern sense, the item as a departure from the frock cots popular at the time and is regarded as the first waistcoat.  Ms Behlen, added: \"Waistcoats were born in London in 1666, promoted by King Charles II. The new fashion soon spread and for at least 300 years a three piece suit soon formed a key part of every man\u0026rsquos wardrobe.  \"Now Watford-born Gareth Southgate is reviving that London tradition and bringing waistcoats home to the forefront of fashion.\"  Fashions change over time, and during the 1750s the garment was shortened to the length familiar to suit-wearers and sports fans today.

It said the offer was around 12% higher than the \u0026pound12.50-a-share bid submitted by US cable group Comcast.  Fox\u0026rsquos sweetened bid is also around 30.2% higher than its original \u0026pound10.75-a-share bid made in December 2016, which valued the 61% stake at \u0026pound11.7 billion.  Its move signals that Fox hopes to see off competition from Comcast after a long battle to buy out Sky, which has come under heavy scrutiny from the UK Government and competition watchdogs.  Earlier this month, then UK culture secretary Matt Hancock said Fox would have to sell off Sky News in order to address media plurality concerns and secure Government approval for the deal.  Fox has already agreed to sell most of its assets \u0026ndash including its current 39% stake in Sky \u0026ndash to Walt Disney.  If Fox buys the remaining stake in Sky before completing the Disney deal, Disney would take full ownership of Sky when it closes its own takeover of the Fox assets.  But in a further complication to the takeover saga, Comcast has also made an all-cash offer for the Fox assets separate from its offer for Sky.  Comcast is preparing to post details of its \u0026pound12.50-a-share Sky offer documents before a Friday deadline under UK takeover rules.  On its higher bid, Fox said: \u0026ldquoAs the founding shareholder of Sky, we have remained deeply committed to bringing these two organisations together to create a world-class business positioned to deliver the very best entertainment experiences well into the future.  \u0026ldquoWe strongly believe that a combined 21st Century Fox and Sky will be a powerful driver for the continued growth and vibrancy of the UK and broader global creative industries.  Sky shares fell nearly 2% following details of Fox\u0026rsquos raised bid.  Fox is waiting for a final decision from the UK Government on whether to accept its proposals over the sale of Sky News to address concerns over media plurality, given that the Murdoch family also owns News Corp \u0026ndash the publisher of a raft of UK newspapers.  Under its plans to offload Sky News to Disney, Fox has pledged to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least \u0026pound100 million a year for 15 years.  But if terms of a sale of Sky News cannot be agreed, Mr Hancock has already told Parliament the \u0026ldquoonly effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether.  A decision is expected by July 12.

But former Conservative leader William Hague warned party rebels that voting against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos final deal could result in Brexit being indefinitely delayed or halted altogether.  And Mrs May herself insisted that her plan \u0026ndash agreed by the Cabinet on Friday, only for David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign days later \u0026ndash would make good on her promise to deliver Brexit.  Set to be published in a white paper on Thursday, the plan envisages Britain continuing to trade freely with the remaining EU in goods under a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook, while accepting restrictions on trade in services.

He replaces Chris Evans at the top, who is shown to be earning between \u0026pound1.6 million and \u0026pound1,669,999 for his Radio 2 Breakfast show.  Last year\u0027s accounts showed the Radio 2 Breakfast DJ took home up to \u0026pound2,249,999 in the 12 months to April 2017 and his salary has been reduced since stepping down from Top Gear.  The top 10 published this year is made up of men, with Lineker and Evans followed by Radio 2 DJ Graham Norton, on up to \u0026pound609,999 - not including payments for his TV chat show.  The other big earners are also men - broadcasters Steve Wright, Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine, Alan Shearer, Nicky Campbell, Nick Grimshaw and Stephen Nolan.  The BBC argues that the list does not reflect the true balance of payments to men and women as salaries through BBC Studios, which is not funded by the licence fee and became a commercial entity, are not revealed.  If included, they would feature payments to Claudia Winkleman for Strictly Come Dancing, Alex Jones for The One Show and Fiona Bruce for Antiques Roadshow.  It also says that changes to pay packets in recent months are also not reflected as the list is compiled from salaries up to April this year.  There are women on the list who did not appear last year.  Mary Berry\u0027s salary is published this year, showing the former Great British Bake Off judge earns between \u0026pound190,000 to \u0026pound199,999 \"for a range of programmes and series\".  Women who are on the list of stars earning more than \u0026pound150,000 this year and appear to have received pay rises include Newsnight\u0027s Emily Maitlis.  Maitlis, who was absent last year despite co-host Evan Davis appearing, took home between \u0026pound220,000 and \u0026pound229,999.  Woman\u0027s Hour host Jane Garvey, who has been outspoken in her criticism of the gender pay pay, is another new name and was paid between \u0026pound150,000 and \u0026pound159,000 for work which also includes programmes on 5 Live and episodes of Fortunately.  Other female stars to appear this year include Newsbeat\u0027s Tina Daheley, who was paid between \u0026pound150,000 and \u0026pound159,000, which also includes cover for BBC Breakfast and Victoria Derbyshire.  This year\u0027s report also features 5 Live Breakfast\u0027s Rachel Burden, Europe editor Katya Adler and Scotland Editor and Sunday Politics journalist Sarah Smith.  Over the last 12 months, the BBC has announced pay cuts for some of its male stars, including broadcasters John Humphrys, who had been paid more than \u0026pound600,000, Vine, who was on more than \u0026pound700,000, and Edwards, who was on more than \u0026pound550,000.  It was disclosed that Today host Humphrys\u0027s salary would drop to below \u0026pound300,000, Radio 5 Live star Campbell\u0027s to below \u0026pound350,000 and newsreader Edwards\u0027s to below \u0026pound500,000 - less than what has been published because the report only reflects the past financial year.  Last year, BBC stars were able to see what their colleagues were paid when the corporation published salaries for 96 people for the first time.  It catapulted the broadcaster into turmoil, with respected China editor Carrie Gracie resigning over unequal pay.  On Wednesday, salaries were revealed in bands of \u0026pound10,000 rather than last year\u0027s \u0026pound50,000, after discussions with the Government over transparency.  The BBC also published the detail of which programmes its stars have worked on, which it hopes \"will help ensure that more informed comparisons can be made\", a BBC source said.  The BBC recently published figures showing it had reduced its gender pay gap by nearly a fifth.  A BBC source said: \"The BBC has come a long way in a short period of time. The job is not done yet, but we are making good progress.\""},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-deck-big-ben-clock-tower-in-england-flags-dubbed-boost-for-scottish-independence","story":"  The SNP hit out after it emerged the restoration of the iconic landmark will recreate its original colour scheme \u0026ndash including six shields above each clock face painted with a St George\u0026rsquos Cross.

But SNP MP Pete Wishart insisted: \"This is a welcome boost for Scottish independence as Westminster prepares to become an England-only parliament.  \"People will, however, be forgiven for thinking that transition began long ago \u0026ndash as Scotland continues to be sidelined and ignored on the biggest issues facing our country.  \"Whether Scotland opposes Brexit, austerity, Trident, or the devolution power grab, our views never seem to matter to a Tory government that arrogantly thinks it can do whatever it likes to Scotland and get away with it.\"  Fellow SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said he didn\u0027t think Westminster bosses had \"thought through the political consequences.  Elizabeth Tower, which includes the Big Ben clock bell, will be repainted its original blue and gold during the ongoing \u0026pound61 million restoration, which is due to be completed in 2021.

But a rose, thistle, shamrock and leek \u0026ndash representing England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales \u0026ndash will also be included in the decorations.

Their announcement came just hours before England are due to take on Croatia in the World Cup semi-final.  Adam Watrobski, Parliament\u0027s Principal Architect, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the major repair and conservation of the Elizabeth Tower, we have carried out extensive research into the original decorative scheme for the clock faces and the adjacent areas.  \u0026ldquoThe dials and clock hands are Prussian blue and gold and the adjacent areas make use of the red, white and blue colours of the Union flag, along with the detail colours used for heraldic shields for each part of the United Kingdom."},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-branded-scotlands-invisible-man-in-the-cabinet","story":"  Paul Sweeney, the Shadow Scotland Minister, claimed the Secretary of State had \"failed to stand up\" for Scotland\u0027s devolution settlement, despite being the longest serving member in one role in Theresa May\u0027s Cabinet.  But Mr Mundell hit back, branding Labour \"just Nicola\u0027s little helpers\" as he attacked the \"once proud unionist\" Scottish Labour Party for \"repeatedly voting\" with the SNP in Holyrood.  Speaking during Scotland Questions in the Commons, Mr Sweeney said: \"I feel I ought to congratulate the Secretary of State on achieving a new milestone as the longest serving member in one role in the Prime Minister\u0027s Cabinet, though I fear it may be a virtue of his invisibility rather than his invincibility\u0026hellip  \"The Secretary of State is failing to stand up for Scotland\u0027s interests when it comes to shipbuilding and his 12 Scottish Tory colleagues and himself have failed to stand up for Scotland\u0027s devolution settlement.  \"So, will he use the influence he should have developed over these last few years and condemn his Government\u0027s handling of the devolution settlement, demonstrating he isn\u0027t just Scotland\u0027s invisible man in the Cabinet?\" asked the MP for Glasgow North East.  Mr Mundell responded by saying: \"What I condemn is the once proud Unionist Scottish Labour Party repeatedly voting with the SNP in Holyrood. What they\u0027ve become I\u0027m afraid is just Nicola\u0027s little helpers.\"  The SNP\u0026rsquos Joanna Cherry told MPs that the UK Government\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan \u0026ldquorode roughshod over the Scottish Parliament. She said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economy is heavily reliant on services and thousands of my constituents work in the services sector, yet the Prime Minister is determined to make a deal, taking services out.  The Edinburgh MP asked the Scottish Secretary: \u0026ldquoHas he worked out yet what the impact of the PM\u0026rsquos decision on the Scottish economy and what is he going to do about it?  Mr Mundell said the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos document, which was \u0026ldquofed in to the Chequers summit, was that the SNP administration did not want the country to leave the EU.  \u0026ldquoWhat the PM is focused on is leaving the EU on the basis that does best for British business but also respects the outcome of a referendum of the whole of the United Kingdom.  After the SNP\u0026rsquos Hannah Bardell also accused Mr Mundell of being \u0026ldquoinvisible and \u0026ldquoineffective in his role and called for him to resign, the Scottish Secretary accused her of \u0026ldquoreheating the same old stuff and declared: \u0026ldquoAt the heart of this is the SNP don\u0026rsquot accept and don\u0026rsquot like the representations I make on behalf of Scotland that is to keep Scotland in the UK.  His Tory colleague Steve Baker, who resigned earlier this week as Brexit Minister in protest at Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, denounced the \u0026ldquoludicrous theatrics of the SNP. \u0026ldquoThey are a disservice not only to the people of Scotland but to the people of the whole of UK for the detrimental effect they had on the passage of the EU Withdrawal Act, he said.  Mr Mundell went on to accuse the Nationalists of not being interested in Britain\u0026rsquos withdrawal from the EU, claiming: \u0026ldquoBrexit has been weaponised purely to take forward the cause of independence and have another independence referendum.  Later, Whitehall rubbished Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos claim of a \u0026ldquopower-grab in the Government\u0026rsquos new Brexit Act. A UK Government insider said: A UK Government source said: \u0026ldquoThere is no \u0026lsquopower-grab,\u0026rsquo it is just an SNP invention.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon expanded her ministerial team to record numbers to handle her Government\u0026rsquos additional responsibilities.

In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 11, 2018 at 3:23 pmFurther roads surface dressing work in Westray is planned for tomorrow, Thursday, July 12, on the B9067, Pierowall to Kirbest road, between Gairy and the junction at Tufter.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dundee city centre Hampton by Hilton is increasing the cost by 360 per cent, from £89 to £409, while the Queen’s Hotel jumps from £53 to £306.             More than 170,000 people are expected to come to the area as the world’s top golfers compete at Carnoustie from 19 to 22 July.             David Groundwater, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “We’d suggest that accommodation providers – especially the big chain hotels – should exercise a degree of restraint when setting their prices.” Tourists visiting Tayside during the Open will be forced to pay hundreds of pounds for so-called budget hotels. Sleeperz, which opened last week, changed its website after mandatory two-night stays above the city’s railway station were being offered for up to £1,620 during the championship in Carnoustie - a dramatic increase from the £59.40 for anyone who wants to check in this Friday. The chain insisted the cost was an attempt to deter bookings so they had spare rooms during the famous golf tournament and insisted anyone who decided to pay such a high price would be given a refund. Operations director Steve Allen said the hotel was fully booked, while it is understood two rooms are being kept spare in case they are required due to unforeseen problems.             Mr Allen said: “Due to a system error in our booking engine this week our website was displaying artificially high prices. This happens sometimes when the hotel is full, to prevent users of third party websites from booking a room when there aren’t any available. “We don’t operate an overbooking policy so the system sets rates to put people off booking. We haven’t ever and don’t expect to have any reservations at these prices. “If a guest did complete a booking at those rates, they would be refunded entirely and charged the rate of the day, exactly the same as the other guests staying that night.” Rooms are available on 22 July, the final day of the championship, for £360.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766840.1531245886!/image/image.jpg","title":"henry mcleish scots need to ditch anyone but england attitude","story":"        Obsession with the \u0026#8216Auld Enemy\u0026#8217 is a distraction and Scotland must focus on creating its own team of footballing world-beaters, writes former first minister Henry McLeish.                Tonight, the World Cup semi-final between England and Croatia will attract record-breaking TV audiences, not only in England but in every part of the United Kingdom. For Scots, given our long memories of epic struggles with England on and off the pitch, who will we be supporting?            This has been an unpredictable and enjoyable World Cup, where Russia and Fifa have exceeded my expectations and have delivered a spectacular reminder of what the beautiful game represents. But England’s role in this festival of football, has, for Scots, always to be seen through the prism of history, identity, nationalism/patriotism, politics and yes, the irritating, arrogant and overblown remarks of English football commentators!            But let’s not overlook the major issue in this discussion – Scotland didn’t qualify for Russia. We haven’t qualified for 20 years, so our ambiguity and ambivalence towards England, is understandable in historical terms but irrelevant to our immediate and dire predicament as a declining football nation.England’s progress in the competition has benefitted from a very easy group stage, but no one should underestimate the improvements made under Gareth Southgate. England has done well so far and have never had a better chance to reach the final. If Scots want to support them, that’s okay by me, but I will retain my neutrality and hope that the best team wins, preferably without a penalty shoot-out. You can’t transfer your football loyalties, but you can certainly give praise where it is deserved. We need to learn from other countries, not resent what they are doing. It makes little sense for Scots to adopt the attitude “anyone but England”! Winning the World Cup is the “landing on the moon” moment for any footballer and their country. If Harry Kane is asked next Sunday to step up and accept the trophy as World Champions. What a fantastic achievement that would be and “well done England”.Our football relationship with the “Auld Enemy” goes back a long way. It is now time to recalibrate, move on and focus instead on our own dismal international football performance. This should be the focus of our anger, frustration, and national despair. We have wasted too much emotional energy on England and its football team over the years. Too often in the past our football rivalry has become a vehicle for the worst excesses of being Scottish. At a time of rapid modernisation, political renewal and a new sense of national confidence, there are bigger priorities.READ MORE: Scotland ‘could host World Cup 2030 matches as part of joint UK bid’On a recent visit to Inverness to deliver a talk on Brexit – another product of delusion, nostalgia, and sentiment on the part of England – I stopped to have a cup of coffee on the battlefield on Culloden Moor. This is always a good venue to charge batteries, not in any nostalgic nationalist way, but merely to enjoy a great historic place to reflect, in what is a strangely peaceful part of Scotland.            In 1746 Culloden was the last battle ever fought on British soil. The Jacobites were routed and destroyed by the Hanoverians in the same time it takes to play the first half of a Scottish Premier League game. Accepting a bit of historical license, let’s read Scotland versus England for Jacobites versus Hanoverians. So much historic and emotional capital has been invested in our games with England. This is not to say these historic clashes – with crowds we can now only dream about – didn’t matter. The fixture between Scotland and England was played annually between 1872 and 1983. In the early days of the game, after the SFA was created in 1873, the Scotland vs England match made a great deal of sense. These were the first two countries to form associations. Some of the games were spectacular battles, providing some magnificent football and some of the highest attendances ever seen in world football – ten of the largest attended games, attracted nearly 1.5 million fans at Hampden. But its importance, to Scottish football, was past its sell by date. In my view the Home Championship and the Scotland-England fixture – covering over a century of football – had become a major distraction for a country that needed to invest more in European and International football, direct the patriotism and nationalism of Scotland to bigger ambitions, and call time on a fixture that seemed to be more than just a football match. Defeating the Auld Enemy – not always guaranteed – became an obsession and a major distraction. It made sense for this fixture to be abandoned in 1983. I also enjoyed my own piece of nostalgia that day, thinking back to 1967 when Celtic won the European Cup and Scotland defeated England at Wembley where Jim Baxter tormented the English team, only a year after they had won the World Cup. Football memories are especially precious in a country where we seem to have stopped dreaming about future glory and have instead to content ourselves with arguing about who we should support in Scotland’s absence. We must get the Ghost of England Past off our back.READ MORE: Euphoria to defeat: the untold story of Scotland’s 1978 World Cup            Success can have a spectacular impact. I was enthused and inspired by the reaction of England to their victory over Sweden. Nearly half the population of their country watched on TV, it was party time and a nation celebrated the success of their team. The pride, passion and patriotism of a nation expressed through football was remarkable. But I wanted it to be Scotland. Why were we not there I kept asking myself? We think we have better fans than the English, so what if it had been Scotland clinching a penalty shoot-out or scoring a spectacular last-minute goal, what might our reaction have been?Everyone would have been glued to their TV screens, the country would have come to a standstill, and there would have been an incredible outpouring of national pride and that sense of achievement only success on the world stage can bring. This is the reality that should fire our desire for the transformation of the game in Scotland. Scotland has the potential to be successful. It has nothing to do with the size of population. It has nothing to do with England. It has everything to do with the size of our ambition and the determination to make the national team – both male and female – our number one priority.Our preoccupation with beating England, and on many occasions, hating England, may have been at the expense of investing more emotional capital and national fervour in other directions. Our football, like our politics, has too often seen England as an historical focus for our weaknesses and opprobrium, not our strengths and ambition.For 20 years and five World Cups, we have failed to qualify. We are fading fast from the minds of the international footballing community. This is not acceptable, neither is it inevitable. This crisis is home grown. The founding fathers of this great game must be turning in their graves, as we squander the legacy of the early years, ignore our undoubted football DNA, and replace the golden age of Scottish football, from the 60s to 90s, with decline, lesser ambitions for our national teams and a failure to take responsibility for what we are doing. The advent of devolution and the growth of nationalism have shifted some of our energy, enthusiasm, and passion for the game, away from football and in to politics. The time when nationalism was worn on the back of a football jersey is over. But hopefully we haven’t bought into the idea that the present state of the game is all we can expect. Scotland was a successful footballing nation with a self-belief that created so many legends and beautiful memories. Agonising over England isn’t going to solve our football problems but winning the World Cup might!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766791.1531292198!/image/image.jpg","title":"maggie chapman scots radicalised by indyref are ditching neo liberalism","story":"        The politics of SNP are, as might be expected from a \u0026#8216national\u0026#8217 party, representative of politics more broadly, both in Scotland and throughout Western Europe. We are at a point of rupture between neo-liberal consensus and several competing programmes for the future.                In 2014, the SNP-led Scottish Government produced a white paper that set out a vision of continuity: an independent Scotland would be slightly better in every regard than a devolved Scotland, but would not be in any way different (we would keep the monarchy, Sterling, the dominant economic model etc). As such, it was a manifestation of the dominant politics of that period: all changes proposed were in continuity with the prevailing system rather than seeking to change it.            It now appears that this was one of the final acts of that period of neo-liberal consensus: the Scottish independence referendum opened up a new, radically different space for politics in which the old certainties had truly melted into air.             A referendum that was supposed to change nothing but the constitutional status of Scotland appears to have changed everything but the constitutional status of Scotland. We have ended up with an ever more energised public making their opinions felt on issues as diverse as fracking and the renewal of local democracy. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: Growth Commission report candid about indy challengesAn SNP Government most comfortable managing a neo-liberal consensus has been pushed into all sorts of uncomfortable positions as the rupture in our politics opens up the earth beneath them.In the last couple of years, I have found Gramsci’s analysis that “the old world is dying, the new world cannot yet be born” becomes truer by the day. And this brings us to the Growth Commission: it is an attempt at reclaiming ideological space, and the commander of this political venture in revanchism is former SNP MSP, Andrew Wilson.It is hard to separate Wilson the author of the Growth Commission from Wilson the PR man at Charlotte Street Partners, whose company’s clients include the fracking firm, Cluff Natural Resources. In the SNP, as in our politics more generally, we see a contest between the dying ways of the old world and the attempt to create a new world.            We are familiar, whether we know it or not, with the way in which neo-liberalism weaves its story: things that are opinions become truth things that are possible become impossible choices are constrained before the debate has even begun. As Noam Chomsky outlined in The Common Good: “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” It is telling, therefore, that Wilson’s attempt to recapture the ideological direction of the independence movement has not been accepted as an unproblematic truth but has been cast into the public realm for debate.The first victory for the radical independence movement has been to deny this report the veneer of being uncontested. That Nicola Sturgeon was unable to accept the report but had to insist that it was “starting a debate” shows how far politics has come since the White Paper in 2014.             READ MORE: Growth Commission is ‘second biggest mistakes of Nicola Sturgeon’s career’It is important that we recognise and claim this victory and use it to start building our own project for an independent Scotland that creates a new world of genuine equality and social justice, and in which we deal with the urgent economic and environmental crises.Predicting what will happen in politics is a mug’s game. But, there is the strong likelihood that there will be an independence referendum soon. We need to take Nicola Sturgeon at her word: the Wilson report must start a debate. The approach we took in the first referendum since devolution charts a course for this. Ideas like Universal Basic Income, the creation of an industrial strategy to create a zero-carbon economy, and the case for a Scottish currency have become widely accepted in the popular imagination. We need to build on these and develop new ideas to shape the debate and make the case for an independent socialist Scotland.            Our focus must be on ways to harness Scotland’s renewable energy industry for social good, and to democratise the economy. The Scottish National Investment Bank should capitalise renewables projects for all public bodies. We should give workers the right to buy their own businesses to be run as cooperatives. We must build new housing to end the housing crisis to be owned through councils and cooperatives. We must find ways to create a publicly owned, zero-carbon public transport system that makes the most of the shift to electric vehicles and automation. And, we must have a debate that brings these ideas and others into the public imagination. I was proud of the role Green ‘Yes’ forces played in helping to create this debate in the referendum four years ago. And I will ensure that it does the same thing in the next referendum.• Maggie Chapman is co-convener of the Scottish Green Party and rector of Aberdeen University.

As the economic, political and cultural power of China grows, the prominence of Chinese is also growing.                 Many cities, including Edinburgh, are training guides and providing signage in Chinese in order to be ‘China ready’. British business is also starting to realise that being ready to trade overseas will in future mean being ready to speak Chinese to China.            But, given the average Brit’s unwillingness to learn any foreign language, it is perhaps unsurprising that there are few confident non-heritage Chinese speakers in Britain and opportunities to learn Chinese in school are limited.             In Scotland, students were first able to sit Chinese exams in 2009, yet in 2017 only 144 did so. We must do better than that.In Edinburgh, we are doing our bit. In partnership between my school and two state schools and with generous funding from the Swire Chinese Language Foundation, we’ve established the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh (SCLCE) to extend opportunities for pupils to study Mandarin Chinese from primary school to Higher exams.\u2028READ MORE: Boom in Scotland’s Chinese tourism market revealed by Nicola Sturgeon in BeijingIn the past, too many Chinese learning schemes have struggled on account of a lack of long-term commitment. You can’t expect pupils to commit to learning Chinese unless their school can guarantee that they will be able to take at least a Higher in Chinese and that their path through to the examinations will be well resourced and supported by high-quality teachers. That is exactly what the Swire Centre does – and it also provides a rigorous system of leadership and quality-assurance, something that can be difficult to achieve where Chinese teachers are working in isolation and often in part-time roles. In all, the SCLCE can call on five Scottish trained and fully registered teachers and at any one time at least three of those will be teaching in state schools in Edinburgh. In the last academic session, more than 600 pupils across 12 different state schools have benefited from this approach.We’re proud that our latest recruit to SCLCE, Brooke Walker, was recognised by the General Teaching Council for Scotland last month as one of their National Probationers of the Year. Brooke is employed by George Watson’s College but she spent her time during her probationary year in five state schools – two primary and three secondary – where her enthusiasm and passion helped to spread opportunities to learn Chinese where they did not previously exist.READ MORE: Study reveals details of first Chinese citizen who became a Scotsman            Amongst those to benefit most have been pupils facing some huge challenges in their lives and who have previously found foreign language learning unrewarding. Chinese is different and pupils engage with it differently, helped by opportunities to experience elements of Chinese literature, music, dance and cuisine. And soon a fully-funded visit to Beijing that Brooke is helping to lead will expand pupils’ horizons in new and exciting ways.Whatever the future holds it is difficult to imagine that China will not have an influential voice in shaping it. We must do all we can to understand that voice and, what is more, to grasp this opportunity to place a non-European culture at the centre of young people’s educational experience for the first time in our educational history. There’s no excuse for our schools not to be “China ready”.Melvyn Roffe is principal of George Watson’s College, one of the three schools to establish a collaboration to secure funding and set up The Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766842.1531290621!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon boris may just have paved way for softest brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis make the least-damaging form of Brexit more likely, writes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.                The twin resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson are the first time in more than 35 years that two UK Cabinet ministers have walked out within the same 24 hours. The last time it happened, the UK was grappling with the Falklands crisis.            That fact alone is a measure of how serious the situation facing the Prime Minister now is.            But the truth is, Monday’s events were always on the cards – it was just a question of when, and which of the Brexiteers would finally break ranks.That it happened within not much more than 48 hours of the Chequers summit, which was finally supposed to have brought unity to a warring cabinet, shows how perilous the position is for Theresa May.Before examining what this means for Brexit, it is worth recounting the fact that we are now more than two years on from the referendum result, but the UK Government has still not published the white paper outlining what it actually wants in leaving the EU. That will finally emerge later this week, unless more unforeseen events delay it further still.But that two-year delay in spelling out any kind of coherent position is simply inexcusable. The truth is that Brexit has always been more about the internal politics of the Tory party than it has been about the national interest.First of all, it was about the Conservatives’ attempt to see off the supposed threat from UKIP, and then, since the referendum, it has been about the ongoing battle of ideological purity within Tory ranks, as many of their MPs have sought to outbid each other in who can call for the most extreme Brexit possible.            READ MORE: Second Brexit vote in 2019 possible, says article 50 authorThe last two years have been, in some ways, the culmination, or at least the latest and perhaps defining chapter, of a 40-year civil war within the Conservative party.But that internal obsession, in putting party interest ahead of the national interest, is a simply unforgiveable abdication of responsibility for any government.The irony is that, for all the talk of Brexit being betrayed, the UK Government is still determined to take the UK as a whole out of the EU, the single market and the customs union. Scotland, of course, voted for none of these things.            I believe the Chequers plan is a step forward in that it appears to offer more realism than we have heard from the UK Government to date, although that may not be saying much. And, of course, we still do not know whether or not as a package it would be acceptable to the EU, in that it still appears to be cherry picking, trying to divide the four freedoms which are the cornerstones of the single market.It is also horrendously complicated and, of course, it excludes provision for services, which account for almost 80 per cent of the Scottish economy, and a similar proportion of the UK economy as a whole. Around a third of our exports are services exports, so while the plan is a step forward from where Theresa May and her Cabinet were a couple of weeks ago, it is nowhere near good enough to protect all our vital economic interests. An extreme Brexit, of the kind threatened by the Tories, also poses a direct threat to Scotland’s long-term economic well-being for many decades to come in the shape of the risk it poses to our working-age population.That threat is one that hangs over the whole of the UK, but the differing demographics of Scotland mean that it is more true of the Scottish economy. Immigration is a subject that may be difficult for politicians to talk about, but it is one that we have a duty to be honest with people about, because the simple fact is that we need to continue to attract the best and the brightest talent from elsewhere. That is an economic imperative for Scotland, but is something that is directly threatened by Brexit.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’            Some commentators have speculated that the events of recent days have raised the prospects of a no-deal Brexit, whereby the UK crashes out of the EU next March with no agreement at all to take its place.However, looking at the arithmetic in the House of Commons, I do not believe there is a parliamentary majority for a no-deal outcome. And I also think that after the Davis and Johnson resignations it is highly questionable whether there is a majority for the Chequers plan as it stands.In my view, the only thing that actually stands a realistic chance of commanding a majority in the House of Commons, as well as being the right thing for the interests of the economy, is continued membership of the single market and customs union. I have been consistent in saying that I do not want to leave the EU, in line with what people in Scotland voted for, but if the UK is to leave then the least worst outcome is one that keeps us in a single market which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.That is supported by practically all mainstream economic analysis. And it is significant that in recent days we have started to see more and more businesses speak out about the very real threat which Brexit poses to jobs, investment and living standards right across the UK.There is now a chance, I believe, that the events of this week will help pave the way for the least damaging Brexit. That was not the intention of David Davis or Boris Johnson in resigning, but it may yet be their legacy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767296.1531315064!/image/image.jpg","title":"big ben to be redecorated with cross of st george","story":"                As part of a major restoration project, workers will return decorative elements around the clock face of the Elizabeth Tower to their original Victorian colour scheme, including a row of shields bearing the red and white cross on the English flag.window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            Palace authorities said the other nations of the UK are represented in floral emblems elsewhere on the clock face, depicting the rose, thistle, shamrock and leek.

You are taking care of one of the most admired colleagues that we have and I think that this is strengthening the links between Scotland and Catalonia.“Two nations with the same goal – the independence of our countries.”            READ MORE: David Mundell to greet Donald Trump on arrival in ScotlandMr Torra, who was sworn in by Catalonia’s parliament in May, said in Spain there was now a “clear violation of human rights relating to self-determination”.He said: “The self-determination referendum on 1 October last year, and the political declaration of independence voted by the Catalan parliament, was prevented by force and physical violence of (the) Spanish state.“The Scottish referendum of the year 2014, agreed between Edinburgh and London, was the best example that conflict should be always resolved by voting and never, never by violence and repression.“Spanish justice is persecuting Clara Ponsati, among other political exiles, for defending every Catalan his right to vote 1 October.            “We would have liked to have had Cameron’s (former Prime Minister David Cameron) same response when they negotiated how the Scots should exercise their right of self-determination.”Prof Ponsati described the president’s visit to Scotland as “extremely symbolic”.She said she was “humbled and very grateful” for the support she had received.The St Andrews University academic faces a four-week hearing this summer where Scottish prosecutors will use treason laws as part of the extradition case.Her legal team, who describe the prosecution as “politically motivated” by Spain, says she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.Referring to the centuries-old treason laws, Prof Ponsati said: “I just find the whole situation surreal.“If it were to succeed we would be seeing one more episode of Outlander.”She added: “I keep calm. I am a toughie. I don’t want to cry, I just want to fight.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4759532.1531313338!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk government to start stockpiling food for no deal brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

This was affectionately branded the \u0026#8220Emmerdale\u0026#8221 farm.\nIn 1998 the firm was one of two which set up in newly opened fish processing units at Gremista, funded by the Lerwick Harbour Trust (now Lerwick Port Authority) and Shetland Enterprise.\nNearly 20 years after that optimistic opening, the storied business is to close its final chapter.\n\u0026#8220We kent it was in the air\u0026#8221, Mr McNab said, \u0026#8220we could see it was in the figures.\u0026#8221\n• More in this week\u0026#8217s print edition of The Shetland Times.\nSeven more private sector jobs gone.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 11 Jul 2018 4:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.
