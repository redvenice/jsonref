Trump told reporters he might host Kim in the U.S. Trump stunned observers when he said the U.S. would cancel military exercizes held every year with South Korean allies. Washington and Seoul are security allies, with around 30,000 US troops stationed in the South to defend it from its neighbor, which invaded in 1950.They hold joint military exercises every year that infuriate Pyongyang, which has long demanded an end to the drills and often responds with actions of its own, ratcheting up tensions.  \u0027We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money,\u0027 President Trump said.  \u0027The war games are very expensive - we paid for a big majority of them, we fly in bombers from Guam.

It turned out that M\u0026ampS had replaced a fresh turkey with a frozen one and the Christmas Cake submitted for the survey was of lower quality than the one used in 2016 (file photo)They said the second difference was that in 2017, they were able to offer a \u0027Classic Christmas Cake\u0027 at a better value price than the \u0027Collection Christmas Cake\u0027 they sold in 2016.M\u0026ampS \u0027strongly believed\u0027 that the products were comparable and taken together with the details made available in the ad\u0027s small print, they considered the ad was not misleading and had in fact provided more information than shoppers could have obtained elsewhere.But an ASA spokesman said: \u0027We considered that consumers would interpret the claim \u0027We\u0027re £10 cheaper than 2016\u0027 to mean that they could purchase the same type and quality of traditional Christmas food items that M\u0026ampS offered in 2016, but that they would be £10 cheaper in comparison.\u0027We noted that the claim featured asterisks that linked to the small print at the bottom of the ad.\u0027That meant that the M\u0026ampS 2017 Christmas dinner deal was different from the 2016 Christmas dinner offer, specifically that it had replaced a fresh turkey with a frozen one and a high-end cake with a cheaper alternative.\u0027Whilst we agreed that these substitutions were of the same type of product they were not of the same quality.\u0027Although the qualification explained the differences, we considered it was not sufficient to override the overall impression of the ad.\u0027He added: \u0027M\u0026ampS\u0027 2017 Christmas dinner deal was different from their 2016 Christmas dinner offer, because it had replaced a fresh turkey with a frozen one and a high-end cake with a cheaper alternative.\u0027Because consumers were likely to understand that the comparisons were like-for like, when M\u0026ampS had compared their Christmas dinner items with cheaper alternatives from 2016, but had not provided evidence that the other supermarkets had done so too, we concluded that the comparative claim \u0027The only supermarket where Christmas dinner cost less than last year\u0027 was misleading.\u0027We told M\u0026ampS that their future advertising for such offers must not suggest that they were offering items of the same quality as in previous years when that was not the case.\u0027Furthermore, they must ensure that their advertising did not suggest that an offer was a like-for-like comparison with their competitors\u0027 unless that was the case and could be supported with adequate evidence.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/10/4C9DD88400000578-0-image-m-10_1527587496378.jpg","title":"Car ads make motorists think autonomous autopilot means vehicle drive itself","story":"    Car makers have been warned of the dangers of suggesting vehicles with some automated features can drive themselvesWill driverless lorries deliver your online orders soon?...Elon Musk blasts media by tweeting article linked to NXIVM -...Share this articleModern vehicles increasingly offer partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls or emergency braking. However, experts say fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK.A report commissioned by the Association of British Insurers said simply using the word \u0027autonomous\u0027 in marketing literature for modern cars is dangerous.

Solicitor-General Robert Buckland swivelled at the despatch box to offer pro-Brussels Dominic Grieve meaningful talks. Their exchanges became so self-absorbed that the Speaker told Mr Buckland to speak to the House as a whole.Government Chief Whip Julian Smith was to be seen among the Tory back-benches, begging with Europhile rebels. Mr Smith moved with liquid nonchalance.          The Brexit Secretary (pictured addressing MPs today) demanded the Commons strip a Lords amendment from the flagship legislation as a showdown in Parliament finally began this afternoonHe lifted his eyebrows, smiled with what he hoped was a shrewd innocence, and leaned so far into colleagues’ ears, it was as though he was going to lick the wax in their lugholes. We could see him wend his way – with a ‘scuse me, Percy, sorry to disturb you’ – to where the rebels glowered. He beckoned a Grieve munchkin, Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon), and murmured. Neighbouring MPs eavesdropped like mad.Then Mr Smith trolleyed silently down to the front bench, to crouch low in front of Mr Buckland and Theresa May. The Prime Minister, jacketed in pea-soup green, computed the news from Aix and seemed content. Back up in the Europhiles’ corner, half-French Grieve, le Duc d’Autosatisfaction, slowly crossed his legs and at brushed lint from his suit. Beside him: not one but two mobile telephones. One kept clear for special friends?          David Davis (pictured in the Commons today) warned Remain rebels are trying to reverse Brexit by forcing a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 amendment into crucial laws on quitting the EUThe debate had been opened by Brexit Secretary David Davis, who ran over the old lines that the referendum result must be respected. Amazing that that should still need to be said. Had it been Mr Davis who offered assurances to Mr Grieve, they would possibly have been rejected.But Buckland is a lawyer and was once pro-Remain. Grieve and fellow Europhile Kenneth Clarke (Con, Rushcliffe) find it hard to be rude to a fellow lawyer. Ditto Anna Soubry (Con, Broxtowe).           Solicitor General Robert Buckland promised rebel ringleader Dominic Grieve his plans to effectively rule out a no deal Brexit would be the basis of talks as soon as tomorrow - but only if he called off a revolt in the Commons tonightShe said she loved Mr Buckland! But Ma Soubry, these days as overwound as the rubber band on a schoolboy’s balsa propeller plane, claimed to be disgusted by the ‘horse-trading’. ‘This has got to stop. It is unseemly,’ she cried, eyes swelling.Other MPs’ eyes just rolled.

Trump told reporters he might host Kim in the U.S. Trump stunned observers when he said the U.S. would cancel military exercizes held every year with South Korean allies. Washington and Seoul are security allies, with around 30,000 US troops stationed in the South to defend it from its neighbor, which invaded in 1950.They hold joint military exercises every year that infuriate Pyongyang, which has long demanded an end to the drills and often responds with actions of its own, ratcheting up tensions.  \u0027We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money,\u0027 President Trump said.  \u0027The war games are very expensive - we paid for a big majority of them, we fly in bombers from Guam.

But that\u0027s not part of the equation right now.

We’re flying these massive bombers in for practice from Guam. I said, how far is Guam? Six and a half hours, sir. So, that’s a long way for a big bomber, times, you know,\u0027 Trump said. He told Hannity, \u0027We’re not going to be doing the war games as long as we’re negotiating in good faith.

It turned out that M\u0026ampS had replaced a fresh turkey with a frozen one and the Christmas Cake submitted for the survey was of lower quality than the one used in 2016 (file photo)They said the second difference was that in 2017, they were able to offer a \u0027Classic Christmas Cake\u0027 at a better value price than the \u0027Collection Christmas Cake\u0027 they sold in 2016.M\u0026ampS \u0027strongly believed\u0027 that the products were comparable and taken together with the details made available in the ad\u0027s small print, they considered the ad was not misleading and had in fact provided more information than shoppers could have obtained elsewhere.But an ASA spokesman said: \u0027We considered that consumers would interpret the claim \u0027We\u0027re £10 cheaper than 2016\u0027 to mean that they could purchase the same type and quality of traditional Christmas food items that M\u0026ampS offered in 2016, but that they would be £10 cheaper in comparison.\u0027We noted that the claim featured asterisks that linked to the small print at the bottom of the ad.\u0027That meant that the M\u0026ampS 2017 Christmas dinner deal was different from the 2016 Christmas dinner offer, specifically that it had replaced a fresh turkey with a frozen one and a high-end cake with a cheaper alternative.\u0027Whilst we agreed that these substitutions were of the same type of product they were not of the same quality.\u0027Although the qualification explained the differences, we considered it was not sufficient to override the overall impression of the ad.\u0027He added: \u0027M\u0026ampS\u0027 2017 Christmas dinner deal was different from their 2016 Christmas dinner offer, because it had replaced a fresh turkey with a frozen one and a high-end cake with a cheaper alternative.\u0027Because consumers were likely to understand that the comparisons were like-for like, when M\u0026ampS had compared their Christmas dinner items with cheaper alternatives from 2016, but had not provided evidence that the other supermarkets had done so too, we concluded that the comparative claim \u0027The only supermarket where Christmas dinner cost less than last year\u0027 was misleading.\u0027We told M\u0026ampS that their future advertising for such offers must not suggest that they were offering items of the same quality as in previous years when that was not the case.\u0027Furthermore, they must ensure that their advertising did not suggest that an offer was a like-for-like comparison with their competitors\u0027 unless that was the case and could be supported with adequate evidence.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/00/4D2B940C00000578-5837341-image-a-14_1528847769038.jpg","title":"Ingenious brickies wear summery skirts dresses health safety rules","story":"    The brickies - who were working in Chertsey, Surrey - were horrified by new health and safety rules forbidding shorts.

The story of German “degenerate art” and the British defence of it is to be told in a display opening to the public on Wednesday at the Wiener library in London, the world’s oldest archive of material on the Holocaust and the Nazi era.It will tell the story of a groundbreaking exhibition of German art held in July 1938 at the New Burlington galleries in London as a direct response to the famous “degenerate art” exhibition staged by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. The latter displayed works by artists including Ernest Ludwig Kirchner, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, with labels such as “an insult to German womanhood” and “nature as seen by sick minds”. The former showed work by many of the same artists in a more celebratory mood. The flyer told potential visitors, with remarkable understatement: “Much of this art is now in official disfavour in the country of its origin”.It was an important exhibition and showed more than 300 works, according to Barbara Warnock, a co-curator of the Wiener display. “It remains the largest exhibition of modern German art that there has ever been in Britain.”The Wiener has borrowed two paintings that were in the original show: Max Slevogt’s The Panther, 1931, and Emil Nolde’s The Young Academic, 1918. Ironically, Nolde was a supporter of the Nazi party. He was neither Jewish nor communist, but he was an expressionist and so was condemned.Warnock said the intention was to highlight the wider context and the human stories around the 1938 exhibition.For example, the Nolde was loaned to the 1938 show by Ernst Nelkenstock, a Jewish German lawyer forced out by the Nazis who resettled with his family in London in 1936. Unable to practise law in Britain, he opened a butcher’s shop. In 1947 he and his family became naturalised Britons and changed their name to Norton.The display includes reproductions of some of the 1938 works, including Max Pechstein’s Fishermen’s Horses, 1919, Kandinsky’s Untitled Improvisation II, 1914, and Max Liebermann’s 1925 portrait of Albert Einstein.The portrait was probably sent to the exhibition by Liebermann’s widow, Martha, who was still in Berlin, in the hope it would be sold. It was bought by the Royal Society, but whether the funds reached Germany is unknown. Martha Liebermann killed herself in March 1943, aged 85.The Wiener display also includes artefacts and documents from its archives telling the story of displaced Jews arriving in Britain before the war.One pamphlet given out to all Jewish German and Austrian refugees reads: “The traditional tolerance and sympathy of Britain and the British Commonwealth towards the Jews is something which every British Jew appreciates profoundly.”It goes on to advise refugees to be be patriotic and loyal and not to speak German in public if they can help it.• London 1938: Defending ‘Degenerate’ German Art is a free display at the Wiener Library in London, 13 June – 14 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea932ecf922fdba53f668f44e24f80daa270b8b8/36_242_2574_1545/master/2574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382d99532745eb742978f0428f024aaf","title":"to forget is to offend the slave trade legacy nicola lo calzo in pictures","story":"From carnival-goers in the West Indies to voodoo ceremonies in west Africa, Nicola Lo Calzo’s photography confronts us with memories of slavery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51374892082972844f08e413299ebe6c0dc3139/0_50_2075_1244/master/2075.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f47e001403b108e1d980ff976710af4d","title":"einsteins travel diaries reveal shocking xenophobia","story":"Private journals kept by the scientist and humanitarian icon show prejudiced attitudes towards the people he met while travelling in AsiaThe publication of Albert Einstein’s private diaries detailing his tour of Asia in the 1920s reveals the theoretical physicist and humanitarian icon’s racist attitudes to the people he met on his travels, particularly the Chinese.Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries see the scientist musing on his travels, science, philosophy and art. In China, the man who famously once described racism as “a disease of white people” describes the “industrious, filthy, obtuse people” he observes. He notes how the “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” After earlier writing of the “abundance of offspring” and the “fecundity” of the Chinese, he goes on to say: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”Ze’ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, said: “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular.“They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”Rosenkranz has edited and translated The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, which have just been published for the first time as a standalone volume by Princeton University Press, including facsimiles of the diary pages. The diaries have only previously been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, with small supplementary translations into English. A spokesperson for Princeton University said: “This is the first time Einstein’s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn’t a serious Einstein scholar.”In Colombo in Ceylon, Einstein writes of how the locals “live in great filth and considerable stench at ground level” adding that they “do little, and need little. The simple economic cycle of life.” Einstein’s perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: “Japanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,” he writes. “Pure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.” But Rosenkranz points out that he also concludes that the “intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition?”“Einstein’s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist – in these instances, other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may ‘supplant all other races’ is also most revealing in this regard,” writes Rosenkranz.“Here, Einstein perceives a foreign ‘race’ as a threat, which … is one of the characteristics of a racist ideology. Yet the remark that must strike the modern reader as most offensive is his feigning not to understand how Chinese men can find their women sufficiently attractive to have offspring with them. In light of these instances, we must conclude that Einstein did make quite a few racist and dehumanising comments in the diary, some of which were extremely unpleasant.”Rosenkranz told the  that although views like Einstein’s were prevalent at the time, they were not universal. “That’s usually the reaction I get – ‘we have to understand, he was of the zeitgeist, part of the time’ – but I think I tried here and there to give a broader context. There were other views out there, more tolerant views,” he said.In his introduction, Rosenkranz writes how it is important to explore how a humanist icon such as Einstein – whose image was once used for a UNHCR campaign with the slogan “A bundle of belongings isn’t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country. Einstein was a refugee” – could have written xenophobic comments about the peoples he encountered.“The answer to this question seems very relevant in today’s world, in which the hatred of the other is so rampant in so many places around the world,” he writes. “It seems that even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc5615b977b25e5abe3648f7387debc3386463f/0_0_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d46e78bcdc52a50a5f338400a061bc7b","title":"could berlin tegel airport be reborn as a nightclub","story":"Tegel airport is being eyed up as a new venue – but plans are meeting with ambivalence as clubbers see their subculture becoming more mainstreamBerlin’s clubbing scene has long taken a creative approach to issues of space, setting events in former power stations, drained swimming pools and public toilets. Now its main airport is joining the list of alternative venues.With Tegel airport set to close following the long-awaited opening of Berlin Brandenburg airport, currently scheduled for October 2020, plans are already being made for the next chapter in its history. Last month Berlin’s culture minister, Klaus Lederer, and Lutz Leichsenring of the Club Commission joined project planners for a tour of Tegel to imagine it reborn as a nightclub.Tegel’s air traffic control towers, expansive hangar and soundproof jet engine testing hall were highlighted as potential spaces for a mixture of temporary and permanent music venues for open-air festivals, studios and clubs. The vision for Tegel also includes new housing and a tech hub. “A whole new district of the city will be born,” says Daniel Bartsch, spokesman for Lederer. “I think Tegel will become a figurehead for the city’s modernity and ersity.”Leichsenring was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities of a basement space he was shown complete with metal pipes, machinery and a readymade industrial aesthetic: “It reminded me of the space underneath the swimming pool in Stattbad Wedding, a former club in Berlin.”Architecture is important to Berlin’s clubbing scene, Leichsenring says: “The Berlin scene doesn’t want anything too clean or chic. It focuses instead on the basics: having a good soundsystem and good bookings. And it is always good to have a building where you see the history when you walk in. Berlin clubs like to work with the shape and the soul of the building.”Situated 8km north-west of the city centre, Tegel’s site was originally used for rocket testing during the second world war and was set to be turned into allotments due to severe bomb damage. However, the first plane landed there in November 1948 after a runway was built in just 90 days to help support Tempelhof airport during the Berlin airlift, when Allied forces in the late 40s broke the Soviet blockade of west Berlin by airlifting goods in directly. It’s been the city’s key passenger airport since the 1970s. Tegel has been operating far longer than intended, though, with the Berlin-Brandenburg originally due to open in 2012. Technical issues, scandals and multiple delays in its construction have turned it into a running joke among Berliners, with a majority voting to keep Tegel open in a nonbinding referendum last year. Critics, however, argue Tegel’s concrete hexagonal terminal building and infrastructure are ill-equipped to meet the city’s growing number of air passengers.Clubbing has also changed a lot in recent decades, as the formerly countercultural scene has been subsumed into the city’s brand. “When the Club Commission was set up in 2000, the club scene was associated with drugs and criminals,” says Leichsenring. “Now it is widely accepted to be part of the DNA and appeal of the city.”He founded the Creative Footprint nonprofit organisation to research live music venues in the city and protect its nightlife from the increasing pressures of regulation, rising rents and property development. “It is very important that with Tegel we talk about building additional clubbing space for the city, and not somehow giving up what we already have,” he says. “Over the years many, many clubs have had to close.”Ben de Biel, a photographer and former club owner, laments the lack of suitable sites: “In the first few years after the wall fell there were so many empty spaces. The first club I opened was in 1991 in an illegally squatted set of flats. It was easy: we found a house, had a look around, broke in, changed the locks and then started a club. Today there is little affordable empty space for clubs left.”De Biel says Tegel’s remote location is less likely to be a drawback to clubbers than the process of its development. He can point to a number of clubs that have thrived outside the S-Bahn train line circling the city centre, but adds: “Normally the clubbing scene itself decides what could be an interesting or sexy site.”Sven von Thülen, DJ and co-writer of the Sound of Family, an oral history of the Berlin clubbing scene, is sceptical of the plans. “I cannot see people from Berlin actually going there,” says Thülen. “I can only see it being a tourist trap. “For a long time Berlin clubs were about reclaiming the city and revitalising forgotten spaces. They were developed from the bottom up … Tegel could be an interesting physical space but it would be a top-down development, a kind of sanitised place.”Considering the ongoing saga of the new Brandenburg airport, it is unlikely Berlin clubbers will get the chance to head to Tegel any time soon. Yet the ambivalence over the proposed club feels fitting in a city that has seen its clubbing subculture become mainstream and its previously squatted venues turn into prime real estate.Leichsenring is keen to ensure the Tegel redevelopment is an opportunity for smaller grassroots groups to develop organically. He envisages it as not only an open-air festival space, but a site for exhibitions, creative agencies, markets, recording studios and rehearsal rooms.“The clubbing scene in Berlin doesn’t need any more commercial spaces,” he says. “We need more accessible space for experimentation, for new sounds, and for communities.

And although I’m rarely troubled by saddle sores, I find the logistics of cycling to work a right pain in the bum: the skanky showers, the outfit changes, the struggle to find somewhere discreet to plug in a hairdryer. And yes, I know that everyone in the Netherlands rides in their ordinary clothes, but I live in Stockport and work in Manchester: would you like to sit next to me unwashed after I’ve ridden 10 miles?The main reason most women don’t cycle in the UK is because they think it is dangerous. You can tell them until the cows come home that the roads are statistically safe, and that you are more likely to be killed walking than on a bicycle. But when they sit on the top deck of a bus and look down to see a cyclist squashed up against the kerb they feel no compulsion whatsoever to join them. Women do seem to be more vulnerable, perhaps because they are often more reluctant to “own” the lane and so end up in the gutter: 10\u0026nbspout of 13 cyclists killed in London in 2009 were women, and eight of them were killed by left-turning HGVs, according to the campaign group Cycling UK.Xavier Brice, at Sustrans, believes city planners are to blame. “Fifty-one per cent of the UK population is female, yet most of our cities are failing to design roads and streets for women to cycle,” he says. It cannot help that women remain under-represented among the transport planners and engineers who design our streets. And most council leaders, who decide how to spend the transport budget, are men.Take Manchester, which has been ruled for more than 20 years by Richard Leese, the council leader. He cycles but was always lukewarm on segregated cycle lanes, say local campaigners. His view, they say, was that smoother tarmac was the answer: if only they could find the cash to fill in all the potholes then more people would saddle up. When new infrastructure was proposed he was against it if it threatened traffic flows.Recently Leese has changed his tune: a nasty scare after getting his wheel stuck in the tram tracks may or may not have sped up his conversion. He now has an Olympic champion on his case too, after Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester’s mayor, appointed Chris Boardman to be its first cycling and walking commissioner. In his first interview after getting the job last year Boardman told me even he no longer felt safe riding on UK streets. Now we have a developing network of segregated lanes in Greater Manchester, with Boardman due to announce more by the end of the month. I\u0026nbspregularly ride along one of them, which goes through the university and hospital districts, and am often struck by how many women I see. On Tuesday I took a Mobike to interview students at Manchester Met and was pleased to see a nurse fly by in her blue uniform, perhaps late for a shift at the infirmary.Until very recently I took a slightly quicker route home, bombing along main roads. Then I got knocked off by someone who didn’t bother looking before he opened his door. I was unhurt, and will not appear in the cycling safety statistics. But when women tell me cycling is too dangerous I can’t, in good conscience, persuade them otherwise.• Helen Pidd is the ’s North of England editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89e1a1812eee271383b0fb9c3de449aeed77424f/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdd1379d5737cf95b689bb82674c1e8a","title":"straight eye for the queer guy owen jones gets a much needed makeover","story":"Declared the ninth-worst-dressed man in the UK, Owen Jones has not found being gay equals having good fashion sense. Can the ’s style squad change things?The first time I went on the BBC’s Question Time, in February 2012, I wanted to make a decent impression. The fact that I looked like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone wouldn’t play in my favour – on my Twitter feed, people regularly queried whether I was taking time off from my paper round when I appeared on TV. But my then flatmate Liam took pity, and promised to leave out a special, smart-looking shirt.I found it laid out for me in our flat, and felt much more confident when I put it on. Fashion was not my forte, but at least, I thought, I had made a real effort. There I was in Nottingham, with big political beasts including John Prescott and Ken Clarke on the panel with me and, for a change, I had made a concession to expectations. It went well. Afterwards I called Liam to thank him. “But Owen,” he protested, “you didn’t take the shirt, you took my girlfriend’s blouse.”It’s fair to say that clothes are not my thing. If you need evidence, here it is: in 2016, GQ magazine named me the ninth-worst-dressed man in Britain – worse than Chris Evans. Growing up closeted near the centre of Stockport, I did everything I could to blend in – a massive dollop of gel, hair combed forward, Kappa tracksuits before graduating to Ben Sherman shirts – then, with a hint of teenage rebellion, I bleached my hair and pierced my eyebrow. I looked like a boyband reject, basically. Unfortunately, when I came out at the age of 20 (originally as bisexual, ruining it for genuine bis by fuelling the whole “bi now gay later” shtick), I was not magically endowed with a set of gay skills such as “being spontaneously sassy” or “having a great wardrobe”. A female friend said to me: “Oh great, now we can go shopping together!” But I hate shopping. I have nightmares about shopping.Thirteen years later, watching the Netflix show Queer Eye is a joy: here’s a show in which five queer men come to the rescue of mostly straight men, who are often imprisoned by their unreconstructed masculinity and struggling to find genuine happiness as a consequence. They teach them how to cook, groom, do up their homes, talk about their feelings and, yes, dress. Before I watched the show – a reboot of the early-00s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy – I worried that it would reduce gay men to this season’s amusing must-have accessories. It always struck me when I was growing up that the portrayal of gay men on television was either as one-dimensional, desexualised camp clowns as the butt of jokes or as would-be sexual predators. But Queer Eye upends all this. I fell in love with the show, and every one of the fab five, instantly. One of my favourites is Jonathan Van Ness, a hairdresser who unashamedly embraces camp: an important role model for gay men who all too often fetishise being “straight acting” (as I once did) and can be horribly prejudiced to those deemed camp. I wish my younger self could have watched a show featuring gay men as superheroes, coming to help straight men struggling with their own heterosexuality.Frankly, though, I’m a proud queer man who needs as much assistance as any of the straight men in the show. I may no longer care about how “gay” I’m judged to be, but I have developed no interest in clothes whatsoever. That’s not uncommon, by the way, among people attracted to members of the same gender who depart from heterosexual norms. Gay, I’m afraid, is not a synonym for sharp dresser.So it was suggested to me by my colleagues that perhaps I could use some styling that there could be an afternoon at  HQ that would amount to straight eye for the queer guy. I was a little apprehensive. Spending an afternoon trying on clothes normally strikes me as about as enjoyable as a night out with Ukip’s youth wing. Fortunately, fashion queen Jess Cartner-Morley and stylist Helen Seamons could see I was nervous, and put me at ease.I turned up wearing a grey hoodie and jeans – standard – and worried they would have got in gold-lined Prada shirts. It wasn’t just the inevitable Twitter storm – CLOTHES LOVING SOCIALIST HYPOCRITE!!! – that I was worried about I also have an aversion to splashing out more than, say, £50 on a shirt. Anything more just seems like a surrender to rampant commercialism. Thankfully, they had thought about all that, and as I eyed up the clothes, I was reassured that none were more than a notch up from high-street prices. I was relieved that I could imagine myself wearing any of them – other than a bright pink Hawaiian shirt that was a bit midlife crisis.Wow, I thought after putting on the first set, I’m wearing clothes that actually fit, rather than throwing on some random crumpled shirt hidden under a generic grey jumper before debating a rightwing thinktanker on Sky News. Some of them I quite liked: a swanky green jacket and a navy blue suit that made me look almost respectable. The bright red T-shirt needs a contrast button, and one of the jacket and trouser combos made me look like a not-very-hench bouncer. Throughout, Helen kept skilfully adjusting the clothes, and jokey patter with her and Jess made an otherwise slightly absurd scenario tolerable. I’m not going to lie, though: it was not me.I guess my perspective on clothes has always been: this is really superficial why should anyone care when I go on TV I’m just trying to get my opinion across, how I look is irrelevant. But this is a bit naive. Perhaps it shouldn’t matter, but it does. Leftwingers are at an automatic disadvantage because they are arguing for a radical departure from the current order therefore, how they present themselves matters. Demanding a crackdown on tax avoidance while wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt will probably attract raised eyebrows more than anything else. It’s OK to look smart and rail against injustice. I’m told some revolutionary sects – such as Militant, of which my late father was a member – encouraged their members to avoid dressing like a radical. John Prescott, meanwhile, has talked of attending Oxford’s Ruskin College as a working-class trade unionist: “I remember our first lecture, all the middle-class guys turned up in their revolutionary gear, we turned up in our suits.”Last year, I did a photoshoot for GQ to accompany an interview: they didn’t tell me the suit they had asked me to wear was worth £1,000, but several rightwing blogs certainly found out. “Owen Jones discusses the ‘crisis of capitalism’ in a £1,000 jacket,” crowed the Spectator. But actually – even though I didn’t own the jacket – this patronises so many young working-class people who (unlike me) pride themselves on what they wear, and often save up for months to splash out on designer items.When my  colleagues asked me to do a photoshoot as a gay man who doesn’t exude style, I was a bit bemused. But, weirdly, I quite enjoyed wearing clothes that looked good and fit me. I doubt I will be crowned Britain’s most stylish man any time soon. But there’s nothing wrong with priding yourself on how you look it turns out it doesn’t make you some superficial bourgeois traitor. Don’t expect me to start embracing Gucci socialism, but maybe I’ll stop treating shopping as a slightly less enjoyable exercise than dental surgery. You can want to change the world without looking like a dishevelled paper boy.GQ were way harsh. Helen and I agree on that, looking through photos of pre-makeover Owen. He’s a good-looking man, he just needs sharpening up a bit. The logic behind his trademark shirt-and-jumper look is that instead of ironing a shirt he puts a jumper over the top to hide the creases. Often, part of the shirt collar is sticking up, or has got tucked inside the jumper, so you can tell he didn’t look in the mirror before going on camera. That tells you everything about what Owen thinks about clothes – he doesn’t.Owen looks relieved that the clothes Helen wants him to wear aren’t flamboyant. “A style overhaul isn’t about wearing lots of colour,” she explains. “In fact, keeping to a minimal palette will help you look sharp.” The idea is professional and presentable, rather than suited and booted. Black jeans that have faded to grey are swapped for dark Japanese-look denim. A smarter shoe takes a jeans-based outfit out of Student Union territory a smart bomber jacket pulls a look together in a way that Owen’s grey hoodie doesn’t. Detail is key: Helen turns up jeans, rolls up T-shirt sleeves, quietly but firmly warns him off lumpily stuffing pockets with phones and keys.I suspect fashion may never be a passion of Owen’s, but the reality of life in the public eye is that clothes are noticed, and judged, whether you like it or not. So it makes sense to try to control, or at least be aware of, the messages you are giving out. Our shoot is tightly sandwiched between speaking engagements – one about Erdoğan, one about Gaza – but when Helen tells Owen the stores these clothes came from (Arket, Cos, new online brand FoR) he writes the names down on his phone for future reference, and I don’t think he’s just doing it to be polite. I don’t think we converted Owen to the fashion cause. But I hope we made him realise we’re not the enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baad57b071357334e23f323123d2d35307585ef7/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8be3883c3fa61119a8dc789cdd61bb36","title":"superfly review a sleek swaggering blaxploitation remake","story":"Director X’s take on the 1972 crime drama is a brutal, visually indulgent saga of extravagance and racial tensions The new remake of blaxploitation staple Superfly starts to feel like a pornographic film somewhere around the shower-set threesome, the steamiest sex scene that a major American studio has allowed in years. But even before that refreshingly indelicate display, Director X adopts pornography’s absolute commitment to the pleasure principle in his fixation on the spectacle of luxury. The first 20 minutes drag the viewer through a neon-lit vortex of raining money, unfathomably expensive cars, zaftig strippers, golden guns and narcotic bricks. This high-gloss take on Gordon Parks Jr’s funky vision of the hustle goes so far into sheer, unabashed rap-video excess that calling it gratuitous would miss the point.Until it suddenly, brutally isn’t. In a crime saga sampling White Heat, Goodfellas and just about every other classic from the gangster era to the gangsta’s, X reiterates the timeless hood adage that when you live by the gun, you die by it too. Well-to-do pusherman Youngblood Priest (Trevor Jackson) is well aware, fitting squarely into the film’s rigid moral code by virtue of a desire to get out of the game. He knows nobody can escape consequences for long, as X metes out immediate punishment from on high for the cardinal sins of disrespect and disloyalty, and Youngblood would rather quit while he’s ahead. With his right-hand man Eddie (Jason Mitchell), he plots a job without their usual connection, Scatter (karate master Michael K Williams, worth the price of admission alone) and utters the accursed words of One Last Job. Cue recklessness, cue folly in blood, cue all-out war with the rival Snow Patrol gang. No, not that Snow Patrol.While Youngblood may be the dope-dealing black Übermensch – his sexual potency is such that he requires not one, but two girlfriends – in this instance, X is the true OG. His bona fides in the world of hip-hop, where he’s been a go-to music video director for two solid decades, are the production’s greatest asset. Beyond enlivening the downbeat scenes with lurid colors nicked from the Hotline Bling clip, he capitalizes on his acumen with details that make the film feel lived-in and personal. This numbers among a small cadre of films shot during Georgia’s tax break-fueled production boom that embrace the character of Atlanta instead of disguising it as another city. A host of local talent fills out the soundtrack, trap-rap legends make inspired cameos, and X conjures all of the weatherbeaten beauty that ATL has to offer. The jargon-heavy dialogue may leave less-hip viewers lost, but it’s still the most naturalistic, plausible element in a film railing fat lines of powdered implausibility.Though perhaps that sense of innate with-it-ness extends past X’s professional expertise and into his very bones. The racial tensions that sparked the inception of the blaxploitation genre have only grown in intensity, and X includes passages suffused with frustration and conflict owed to Youngblood’s identity as a black man shining in America. The small handful of white characters are not to be trusted, vipers waiting the right moment to wedge their fangs in our hero’s back. They’re broadly drawn, almost cartoonishly evil, and yet the iconography of their misdeeds has a potency of its own, particularly one scene that sees Youngblood express America’s simmering antipathy for cops in cathartic, violent terms. The healthy distrust of institutions that characterizes the best of the blaxploitation canon has been amply applied here, amounting to a bracingly unsubtle assault on white complacency.But X is a firebrand second and minister of indulgence first. Superfly is never more satisfying than when behaving like a series of music videos that exalt in the beauty of slow motion, whether of jiggling thong-clad buttocks or the Michael Mann-styled high-frame-rate action sequences. Extravagance acts as its own currency in the stunt-or-be-stunted-upon culture Youngblood vows to fight his way out of, and X fits right in with his penchant for overflowing aesthetic opulence. The joy of X is often simple and immediate – the leather trenchcoatturtleneck ensemble, the seat-rattling bass of the 808-on-steroids score, a swaggering dolly shot drifting in and out of candy-colored rooms as if in a cross-faded haze. At long last, Hype Williams’ legendary Belly has found a deserving companion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/524ca0dfa4ac880f4b0085e9f804441a8b3d2925/1140_109_1162_697/master/1162.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac3084de67d4b701d0d61415a7f44c9a","title":"arsenal sampdoria lucas torreira agree deal transfer","story":"Arsenal have agreed a £26.4m (€30m) deal to sign the Sampdoria midfielder Lucas Torreira and were discussing personal terms with the Uruguayan’s representatives in Milan on Tuesday.The 22-year-old did have a £21.9m (€25m) release clause in his contract, which has another four years to run, but Arsenal offered the extra €5m to beat off competition from Napoli.

I’d had a lot of injuries that season, and in April I was selected for an England B game and Glenn Hoddle said: “I want to take you but you’ve not played enough games.” I didn’t think I was going. Then he announced a 30-man squad with me in it, and we went to a training camp at La Manga. Every session you’re trying to decipher what it means for your place in the squad.Eventually, those of us who made the 22 were told at the hotel, all at the same time. It quickly came out that Paul Gascoigne had been pretty unhappy at missing out, and that’s what people remember. We’d been together for a while and all of a sudden you’re losing some of your colleagues, and as pleased as you are that you’re not one of them, watching those guys head out the door, seeing their sadness, that wasn’t good for the group.I think what Gareth has done is much better. There’s people on standby but everybody knows where they stand. And I like his squad: I think England have always picked players for tournaments because of their reputation. This is the first time I’ve seen a squad genuinely picked on merit.In France we were in a hotel in the countryside. The facilities were fantastic and we had some things to do – a pool table, table tennis – but there’s only so much of that you can play. There are going to be periods of boredom. When you’ve got nothing to do you pick up a newspaper, and that’s when the media scrutiny hits you, and if there’s negative press the squad picks up on it pretty quickly. Gareth has been to tournaments, he’ll know that and he’ll put something in place to stop the boredom kicking in. I would have liked to go out on some trips, to get the players in a group together, away from the hotel. But then if results are bad everyone would have complained that the players were off doing that rather than concentrating on football.Knocked out 2-1 by Brazil in quarter-finalsThere were a lot of injuries in the buildup – David Beckham was coming back from a metatarsal, Kieron Dyer and Steven Gerrard were both affected by injury and replacements were flying in and out. I think if a player’s carrying an injury going into a tournament, they’re never going to get fit enough to come into the team and make a difference. Especially if it’s your star man, the attention it creates, especially if that player doesn’t play to his best, it has a negative impact on the squad. You want to get rid of all that razzmatazz – a player needs to have played at least a couple of games at the end of the season, and the manager needs to be strong enough to make that call.He doesn’t have to only pick players who are in form, though. You need people with international experience, who the manager trusts, but if you’ve got a few players on the fringes of the squad who were in form at the end of the season, they can make a difference.I have good memories of that World Cup. I think it was the most well-organised tournament I went to. There were some big distances to travel but the facilities were fantastic, the pitches were first class and I think every detail was taken care of perfectly. My family came out, and nobody had a murmur of complaint. Plus we beat Argentina. We were a long way from home but at a World Cup that doesn’t make a difference. You’re in your bubble. You could be on the moon and it wouldn’t make a difference.Knocked out by Portugal on penalties in quarter-finalsWe were staying in Baden-Baden and a lot of us had friends and relatives nearby. Seeing my mum and my then girlfriend, having my mates there – and to this day they say it was the best holiday they’ve ever had – was a nice escape. It felt good at the time. But the way the British media reported the fact that our families were out there and enjoying themselves, the way they blew everything out of proportion, I thought was out of order. My mum was having conversations with journalists, having meals with them – they were staying at the same hotel – but then these reporters were stabbing people in the back and sneaking secret cameras around. As players we didn’t like that and maybe it distracted us.Since then the FA have gone down a different route. As a footballer you should be able to focus for a few weeks. I think if players want to see their wives or girlfriends and kids then that’s fine, but if it’s your mates, and your mates’ mates, that crosses the line a little bit. I think the ideal scenario would be for families to be nearby but in a more controlled environment, with the press kept away.Other than that I was pretty happy with everything off the pitch. I felt as a squad we did have togetherness and did mix together. On the pitch, though, there was a ide. You had your starting XI, everyone knew who was in it, and everybody else was made to feel very distant. I was on the bench with the likes of Michael Carrick and Wayne Bridge looking at Sven-Göran Eriksson and thinking: “This guy, no matter how bad we play, he’s never going to change his team.”If any player finds himself in that situation my advice would be: stay focused, because if you get past the quarter-finals, which we nearly did, that’s when injuries and suspensions kick in and you might be needed. But hopefully Gareth Southgate will make sure the ide between the first XI and everybody else never develops.Knocked out 4-1 by Germany in last 16We made two trips to Austria before the tournament, the first a couple of days after the FA Cup final – those of us who’d played at Wembley got two extra days off. So there wasn’t much of a break, and we were together a long time. Then we were stationed out on our own in South Africa, without any entertainment or interaction with the community, nothing to take your mind off football. Some kind of distraction is needed. Retrospectively, that is something I’d have changed, and I don’t think those mistakes will be made again. To get to the end of the season and go straight into a tournament was probably not the right thing, and Gareth Southgate has given the players some rest. You only need about five days. It’s a rest for the mind as much as anything, some time with your family before you go away.I’ve never been one to have families at tournaments. I find it a distraction. It’s a month out of your life, not an eternity. Families can fly in and out and I don’t mind that so much, but the idea of them being permanently around I find quite difficult. After 2006 we went from one extreme to the other, and the middle ground is where you want to be.Once the football starts, all eyes are on you and the scrutiny is intense. We started with a draw against the USA, and if your tournament begins poorly it can be hard to press the reset button and get the confidence flowing again. In 2010 that’s something we certainly didn’t manage. That will be one of Southgate’s big battles, trying to take all the nonsense away from the players, trying not to let any over-the-top negativity infiltrate the team. Once it seeps in unfortunately it does affect performances. At Euro 2004 we got a bit of momentum and had the feeling we could maybe win it. None of the other tournaments I was involved in was like that.Knocked out in group stageI remember when I found out I was going. The announcement was scheduled for about 12pm, and it was nearly then and I hadn’t heard anything. Then I got a text from the FA telling me what time to be at the airport, so I sent one back saying: “Am I in the squad then?” And that’s how I found out, about 10 minutes before it went public.I was made up to be going. I felt that every time Roy Hodgson had called on me I’d produced, and I thought I was going to play a part in the World Cup. In the end I sat on the bench for all but the last three minutes of the Uruguay game. I wasn’t expecting to be in the starting XI but what baffled me was when we needed a goal I was kept on the bench. I was flying at that time and just desperate to get on.We pretty much knew the team and even if the lads had a bad game I don’t think he would have changed it much. That’s been an issue over the years – the team’s been based on names and not form. If I had one bit of advice for Gareth Southgate it would be: change the team, play the right team for every game.When we got to Rio we were staying in a really nice hotel but we just couldn’t leave it. We were in an amazing city but couldn’t see it. A few lads tried to go to the beach and apparently it was just chaos. That was hard at times. Then we had to travel an hour, sometimes more, to training. It wasn’t so far, it was just traffic. The police basically had to shut down Rio to get us there. Maybe a football complex would have been better, somewhere with space to go outside in your free time and training facilities.The way the FA look after the players is amazing. You get treated like kings. But the pressure from the media was something I was not ready for. It shocked me how intense that was and the pressure does creep in. I think the FA bow to the press far too much and if I were Southgate I’d be trying to change that. If damaging stories come out, try to keep the lads away from it and take the pressure off. I’m not saying they should have a drink – those days are gone – but get the players socialising, make sure they have a laugh and let friendships grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d62207244450131af18054c6afd9c121d7c91f67/1036_86_1161_696/master/1161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1420c2ad101ee3219044cdbc783c8442","title":"julen lopetegui appointed real madrid manager","story":"Real Madrid have chosen Julen Lopetegui to be their next manager, with the current head coach of the Spanish national side set to move to the Bernabéu after the World Cup.Lopetegui, who has signed a three-year-deal at Real, has a long association with the club, though he made a single professional appearance as a player. The 51-year-old will now face the challenge of refreshing a side that have won the Champions League three times in a row and boasts some of the biggest talents – as well as egos – in world football.“Real Madrid announce that Julen Lopetegui will be the coach of the first team during the next three seasons,” the club said in a statement. “Julen Lopetegui will join the club after Spain’s participation in the World Cup, after two years leading the national team.”With the World Cup two days away the news of Lopetegui’s appointment came somewhat out of the blue and the timing will be questioned in Spain. From Madrid’s point of view, however, it is likely to be seen as a sensible move after the sudden departure of Zinedine Zidane last month. Lopetegui’s association with Real goes back 30 years to when he was a youth team goalkeeper. He also worked for the club as a scout and as coach of the club’s B team, Castilla.Perhaps just as importantly the Spaniard was available. It had been widely understood that the president of Real Madrid, Florentino Pérez, had made Tottenham’s Mauricio Pocchetino his first-choice candidate to replace Zidane. But the Argentinian had signed a contract extension at White Hart Lane the week before the Frenchman’s departure and attempts to negotiate with Spurs’ notoriously intractable chairman and chief executive, Daniel Levy, got nowhere.Jürgen Klopp and Antonio Conte were also considered but proved too expensive. Lopetegui, meanwhile, extended his terms with the national side only recently but the compensation clause in his contract was an insubstantial €2m (£1.75m), which Real have paid.Having taken over from Vicente del Bosque as national coach in 2016, following a disappointing European Championships, when they were knocked out by Italy in the round of 16, Spain have gone unbeaten in 20 matches. Lopetegui has revitalised their style and rejuvenated an ageing team. He will be expected to do the same at his new club where as many as five first-team players are no longer wanted by the club.Lopetegui has a spine of Real Madrid players in his team, with a total of six in the World Cup squad, and has built a particularly strong relationship with the club and national captain, Sergio Ramos. It is understood that that Madrid consulted their Spanish internationals before making the appointment.Lopetegui was on Madrid’s books as a player for six years, though he played for the first team once. He also played for Barcelona and has been on record singing the praises of Lionel Messi, which may not go down well with Madrid supporters.As a manager, Lopetegui has coached at all levels of the Spanish national side, winning the Under-19 European Championship in 2013 and the Under-21 equivalent the following year. His one significant role in club management came at Porto in 2014 but it was not a success and Lopetegui was fired after less than two years in the job. He was then approached to become manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, only for the Spanish FA to secure his services shortly before a move was completed.Spain begin their World Cup on Friday with a much anticipated all-Iberian encounter with Portugal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993d6a8acb55d443bd0be9b523b7b15e84e8a6cc/8_32_4155_2492/master/4155.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83374fa2014016900e434f7789c7c2e","title":"morocco boost 2026 world cup united bid us mexico canada","story":"The race to host the 2026 World Cup finals was too close to call, according to Fifa insiders, as Morocco received a late boost to their hopes with the expectation that four US territories will abstain from voting on Wednesday.The so-called united bid of the USA, Mexico and Canada is the technically safer option and definitely more attractive financially to the voting federations but that may not be enough to carry them over the line. Their position was weakened by the expectation that four US territories at\u0026nbspthe centre of a voting row will not\u0026nbsptake part.Morocco has been pressing Fifa for several weeks to intervene and exclude the US-governed territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands because of a perceived conflict of interest.This is the first World Cup vote since England endured a shock defeat in the contest to host the 2018 finals when Russia and Qatar were picked to host consecutive tournaments despite being vastly weaker on paper.The subsequent revelations of widespread corruption within the world governing body mean the landscape is very different this time, including the fact that it will be an open vote.It is expected that 201 of Fifa’s 211 member federations will vote at the annual congress at Moscow’s Expocentre on Wednesday. The four bidding nations are excluded and Ghana and Kosovo are understood not to have sent representatives.The Fifa hierarchy – including the president, Gianni Infantino – are understood to prefer the united bid, which has promised to generate a profit of £8.1bn for Fifa compared with the projected £4.48bn the Morocco World Cup would raise. But there are other geopolitical and football factors to consider.Some of those close to the united bid were concerned that interventions by Donald Trump during the campaign period may have worked against them. In April, he tweeted: “The US has put together a STRONG bid w Canada \u0026amp Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the US bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?”There were suggestions that his antagonistic manner could alienate some nations and also that the recent public dispute with Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, could undermine the collaboration between two of the hosting nations.However, it emerged that behind the scenes Trump has been lobbying on behalf of the bid. He sent three letters to Infantino and other Fifa officials offering reassurances should the united bid win. Trump pledged that his hardline stance on visas would not affect visitors to the country during the tournament. The letters, seen by the New York Times, also cite the 1996 and 2002 Olympic Games and the 1994 World Cup as examples of major international events hosted by the US.But Morocco’s bid team were confident they could sway a few nations who might be undecided, continuing their lobbying night in Moscow hotels and bars. They will also have a 15-minute presentation to congress on Wednesday morning to make a last‑ditch plea for votes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63ca12a7a81bd5f1fea52b5d3f6f290ad5f41c71/70_219_3419_2052/master/3419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b047bbac830e1c189a7f1116984aeed","title":"var world cup referees flag offsides pierluigi collina","story":"Fans inside the World Cup stadiums will be shown replays of incidents requiring video assistant refereeing decisions to reduce the confusion that has reigned during trials of the technology in England and other domestic leagues.Supporters at the tournament in Russia will be shown clips of the passage of play that was under revision but only once the referee has made his decision and play has\u0026nbsprestarted.Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of Fifa’s referees committee, said the problems with lengthy delays during trials had been ironed out. The Italian also said assistant referees had been advised to keep their flag down for tight offside calls and to leave it to VAR to decide.“If you see some assistant referee not raising the flag, it’s not because he’s making mistakes,” Collina said. “It’s because he’s respected the instruction to keep the flag down. They were told to keep the flag down when there is a tight offside incident and there could be a very promising attack or a goal-scoring opportunity because, if the assistant referee raises the flag, then everything is finished.”There will then be 13 referees who officiate, exclusively watching the control screens in the video operations room. Collina confirmed the VARs would wear the full kit, identical to their colleagues out on the pitch.“It’s because they sweat like they do\u0026nbspon the pitch,” he said last week. “It’s not like watching a game on the couch while drinking coffee.

Dominic FifieldNotoriously hard to call before a round of games has been played. Brazil beating Germany would be my preference. Barney RonayBrazil against Germany - the ultimate test of Brazil’s temperament and a tale of vengeance in result if not in scoreline. Amy LawrenceBrazil to beat Germany. Brazil have got everything but, most importantly, balance and a hardier mentality under Tite. Germany remain intimidating and even greater than the sum of their parts. David HytnerBrazil and Germany, and Brazil will ultimately be crowed champions. Stuart JamesFrance and Germany would not be a massive surprise but a lot depends on which Paul Pogba shows up the player who dictated a £100m move or the one which has struggled for consistency at Manchester United. Martha KelnerBrazil and Spain, and Brazil will win. Tite’s side have been impressive in the build-up to the tournament, have solidity and have rested Neymar. Sid LoweThe dream final would be France versus Brazil - a repeat of the final from 20 years ago, and hopefully with the same result. Marcel DesaillyGermany against Brazil, and Germany will win. Thomas HitzlspergerI’m certain Brazil will be in the final. Who will join them is a hard choice to make but it would certainly be interesting, and make for a great match, if Argentina joined them. MartaNeymar is a decent shout and should be particularly fired up bearing in mind the way his last World Cup finished. DTNeymar, whose goals will propel Tite’s side to the final and presumably then earn him a long mooted move to Real Madrid. DFRomelu Lukaku. Or someone else. Ideally a surprise from a minor nation who gets four in one game then goes home. BRGabriel Jesus, supplied by Neymar and Roberto Firmino, could fill his golden boots. ALLuis Suárez. Uruguay’s draw is a dream and they will make the quarter-finals, at least, giving Suárez plenty of game-time to do damage. DHRomelu Lukaku. The Belgian has a good scoring record at international level and is the spearhead of a team that should go far. SJ Antoine Griezmann could light up this tournament, arriving in Russia on the back of inspiring Atletico Madrid to a Europa League title. His record for France isn’t bad, though, with 20 goals in 53 games. MKNeymar. The Brazilian arrives in Russia with fresh legs and a desire to take his nation all the way. France’s Kylian Mbappé is also a decent shout. SLRomelu Lukaku. He’s on great form, has everybody playing for him and some great passers to provide him with the ammunition he needs. MDGabriel Jesus. I watched him quite a lot last season and really liked his movement, not to mention his scoring rate. He’ll get plenty of service playing in the same team as the likes of Neymar and Philippe Coutinho and, given I’ve predicted Brazil will get to the final, he should play plenty of games, also. THNeymar. He was hurt, played two games and scored in both – I can’t wait to see him in action. MSwitzerland. The Fifa world rankings are not the best way to judge a team, perhaps, but there must be some valid reasons why they are currently sixth (ahead of France and Spain). DTSerbia. Mladen Krstajic’s team are unfancied, but boast strength and quality. The key will be ensuring players perform to the same levels they invariably achieve at their clubs. DFThis question contains an internal contradiction. Colombia for the semis, maybe. BRUruguay, a mix of renewed confidence and wily old know-how. ALI see Croatia going deep into the tournament – maybe even the semi-finals. Any team with Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Mario Mandzukic deserves respect. DHDenmark. They’re 15 matches unbeaten and this could be the stage for Christian Eriksen to shine. Mind you, their opening game, against Peru, won’t be easy. SJPeru return to the World Cup after a 36 year absence but they are full of hope, galvanised in part by their captain, centre forward and all time top scorer Paolo Guerrero managing to overturn a 14-month drugs ban just weeks before the world cup. MKWould it count as a surprise for Egypt and Uruguay to do well? The two sides from group A certainly could do so. Uruguay have their usual qualities, have Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield and a quiet, competitive confidence. SLBelgium. Technically they are so good, they have so many talented players. I truly think they can bring a new name to the nations that have won the World Cup. MDEngland. There is little expectations around the squad but I think they will get to the quarter-finals. THSweden. It is a country that I have a lot of affection for and I want them to do well in this World Cup. MHirving Lozano of Mexico sounds good fun: talented, fiery and nicknamed “Chucky” because of his apparent resemblance to the Child’s Play doll. Lozano scored 19 goals as a winger for PSV Eindhoven last season and is likened to Luis Suarez, though hopefully he will manage not to bite anyone. DTSamuel Umtiti. That may sound odd given the French centre-half plays at Barcelona, but he was rushed into the team at Euro 2016, making a senior debut in the quarter-final, and is a far better player now. DFHe’s already at Barcelona and cost £90m but I think Ousmane Dembélé could remind everyone exactly why. BRKylian Mbappé, who has achieved so much already but in his teens this will be his first major tournament. ALSergej Milinkovic-Savic. The 23-year-old Serbia and Lazio midfielder is tall, dynamic and has an eye for goal. I’m looking forward to watching him, together with Morocco’s creative midfielder, Hakim Ziyech, who plays for Ajax. DHPoland’s Piotr Zielinski. The 24-year-old was a key member of the Napoli team that pushed Juventus all the way in Serie A last season. SJKarol Linetty. The Polish midfielder’s inventive play has seen him glitter for Sampdoria and catch the eye of one or two Premier League clubs. More could take interest if he has a good World Cup. MKMarco Asensio and Kylian Mbappé. This could be the tournament when they underline just how brilliant they’re going to be. SLIt’s difficult to say, but, if pushed, Kylian Mbappé. He has the potential to be a big World Cup star. But will it be at this World Cup? He is still very young. MDBenjamin Pavard, a young defender I work with at Stuttgart and part of France’s squad. He can play right-back but, for me, is much better suited to being a centre-back. He is calm and composed, good in the air and aggressive when he needs to be. A real talent. THHe’s still only 19 and there were ups and downs in his first season at Paris Saint-Germain but I feel Kylian Mbappé could make a really big impact for France. MThere is a potential quarter-final against Brazil or Germany looming. Even with the new wave of optimism, surrounding Gareth Southgate’s team it’s difficult to see them getting past that stage. DTThe quarter-finals, playing some encouragingly enterprising football along the way.

ALThe quarter-finals, where we will lose on penalties to Germany. DHThey will get out of the group but it’s hard to see them progressing any further than the last 16. SJQuarter-finals. This is the minimum target the FA has set and is eminently achievable for a team which seems to have had the shackles removed. MKQuarter-finals. Am I alone in thinking that England are actually quite good? I like the look of them offensively. SLIt is hard to say as England are short of experience. I feel they will need this tournament to grow as a group of players. MDThe quarter-finals. With a bit of good fortune and good play, they could even make the semi-finals. THThey will definitely get out of their group and possibly go beyond that. MHarry Kane. People forget how poor he was in the European Championship, booed by the England fans, but if Kane is on form the team have a striker who can trouble any defence. DTHarry Kane, making his mark at a major finals. The one player of real pedigree in English ranks. DFRaheem Sterling. Will bring a dash of Manchester City to things and finally score a couple of goals - hopefully with his gun foot, before suggestively unfurling his sock for the cameras. BRHarry Kane. Has to be. ALKyle Walker. He has a pivotal role on the right of Gareth Southgate’s back three, where he brings defensive cover and, crucially, pace on the transitions. Confidence is high after his superb debut season at Manchester City. DHHarry Kane. England’s captain, principal goalscorer and, it’s fair to say, best player. SJHarry Kane is vital to England’s success as one of our few genuine world-class players. The captain has no shortage of motivation, claiming a World Cup victory would be trump winning the Champions League with Tottenham. MKMarcus Rashford. On the basis he is given continuity, confidence and a certain level of freedom. SLThe guy who has really confirmed his talent on the big stage is Harry Kane and if he gets good service he could be one of the top scorers in Russia. MDHarry Kane. He needs to score goals and I’m sure he will. THHarry Kane. He had a great season with Tottenham Hotspur and his goals will make a difference for England. MThe final. It’s a World Cup final. For a journalist, there’s no better moment when it comes to covering the sport. DTOff the pitch, seeing The Motherland Calls in Volgograd. On it, that jaw dropping contest to match the drama of Belo Horizonte in 2014. DFDiscovering that, in fact, everyday Russians aren’t all Putin-mad dopes or gumshield-clad football hooligans. Also vodka. BRExploring Ekaterinburg and watching football in an unexpected place. Japan versus Senegal in a city known as the ‘gateway to Siberia’ is what it’s all about. ALThe best thing about the previous World Cups I’ve covered has been the carnival vibe. I hope it’s the same this time. DHSeeing Colombia play. I had the pleasure of watching them in Brazil and they were a joy. I also haven’t forgotten how a few of their fans felt sorry for me when I ordered a table for one in a Brazilian steakhouse – four years later and we’re still in touch. SJI’m genuinely intrigued to see what sort of World Cup-host Russia will be and if they can succeed in reversing opinions of some visitors that the country is cold and unwelcoming. MKThe same thing you always look forward to at the World Cup – loads of fans from loads of places making loads of noise and discovering players and teams..Some ‘random’ player being brilliant. SLI’m excited to see which teams are going to surprise us AND which teams are going to show from the very outset that they are here to win it. MDAlthough I think Germany will win the World Cup this looks like a really open tournament, with quite a few genuine major contenders as well as teams would could cause a major surprise. It should be fascinating. THTalking about soccer, watching beautiful and clean games, with sportsmanship, fair plays and no dirty plays. That’s what I hope to see, anyway. MThis might be the worst prediction of them all, but I don’t think there will be the racism or riots that people fear. We heard similar before Euro 2012 in Ukraine and Poland, plus other scare stories before the World Cups in South Africa and Brazil, but it tends to be different in the big tournaments. DTThe inevitable shambles and confusion which will be VAR. DFThe only thing any football hack ever really worries about is the wi-fi. Will it be good? Will it come and go? Will it fade at kick-off? I’m worrying about it right now. BRHaving been in Marseille for England versus Russia, digging out the old Italia ‘90 “No All Violenza” T-shirt and hoping for a peaceful tournament. ALVAR leading to confusion inside the stadiums and, potentially, killing the emotion of big moments. DHThe battery life on my new mobile phone. Any incomplete answers in here are down to the fact my phone died while trying to file. SJThat we will spend the next five weeks talking exhaustively about decisions made by Video Assistant Referees. MKConnection issues and late goals. Long distances. Cyrillic script. On the pitch: teams turning defensive when it gets decisive. SLThat all the talk about security and organisation will overshadow the football. As a Fifa ambassador l have visited many stadiums, met many Russians, and l am confident in the capacity of Russia to run a great tournament. MDVladimir Putin and Gianni Infantino appearing on our television screens more often than the actual players. THUgly incidents between supporters.

Updated advice from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) stresses that new mothers should be given appropriate support if they make an informed decision to bottle-feed. The guidance still says babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, in line with advice from the World Health Organization (WHO).But the RCM has acknowledged that some mothers struggle to start or carry on breastfeeding, and says the decision is a woman’s right. Its chief executive, Gill Walton, said: “Evidence clearly shows that breastfeeding in line with WHO guidance brings optimum benefits for the health of both mother and baby. However, the reality is that often some women for a variety of reasons struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding. “The RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice. “If, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected.” The National Childbirth Trust has previously warned that women can face judgment or feel guilty about the decisions they make when it comes to feeding their baby. But the RCM said it recognised that “some women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed”. “They must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby,” Walton added. “We know that every woman wants the best for her baby and we want to be able to empower our members to support women to be the best they can be and enable them to make decisions that are right for themselves and their babies.” The organisation also said that those who chose to breastfeed needed more support and should not feel “guilty or embarrassed” about breastfeeding in public. Research has found breastfeeding can have long-term health advantages, with children less likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life.

Is he the only one left in Britain? By  Patrick BarkhamWe cannot speak of its loneliness, but it must be Britain’s most solitary animal. For the last 16 years, every winter, a male greater mouse-eared bat has taken up residence 300 metres inside a disused and exceedingly damp railway tunnel in West Sussex. The greater mouse-eared bat has been all but extinct in this country for decades. This is the only remaining one we know of. The future of the species in Britain appears to rest with one long-lived and very distinctive inidual.The greater mouse-eared bat is so large that observers who first discovered it in Britain likened one to a young rabbit hanging from a wall. In flight, its wings can stretch to nearly half a metre – an astonishing spectacle in a land where bats are generally closer to the size of the rodent that inspired their old name: flittermouse.The bat has large, mouse-like ears and its feeding habits are as striking as its size. Rather than zig-zagging through darkening skies collecting flying insects, like most bats, Myotis myotis descends earthwards, flapping its wings very slowly as it covers the ground, picking up grasshoppers, crickets, dung beetles and other flightless insects as it goes. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey.The solitary inidual who spends the winters in West Sussex has never been observed in flight. Where it goes each spring is not known, and what it does is not known, nor which other animals, if any, it encounters. All that is known is that each winter the bat faithfully returns to its dark tunnel, where it hangs, almost motionless, for five months. This place of winter rest is a closely guarded secret, for the bat’s select band of self-appointed s are adamant: there can be no repeat of the scenes of 1957. That year, a live colony had been found inside an old mine on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset. Although a reasonably familiar sight in southern Europe, where large colonies roost in caves, this was the first time a greater mouse-eared bat had been found in Britain. The Times published photographs, and a media frenzy ensued. Several animals were whisked out of hibernation and transported to TV and photographic studios and filmed for weeks before being returned to their hibernation hole. Disturbing bats mid-hibernation can kill them. Money was also offered for dead specimens and collectors spirited iniduals away.This fascination was fatal: the greater mouse-eared bat was barely seen again in Dorset, apart from reports of “very large, broad-winged bats” in an appropriately gothic setting: flying around Corfe Castle. Although another small colony of greater mouse-eared bats was found in West Sussex in the late 1960s, by 1992 the species was declared extinct in Britain, the first mammal to disappear from our shores since the wolf 250 years ago.Bats fly beneath our radar. While butterfly sightings have been collected for 400 years and birds have been scientifically monitored for more than 70 years, bats only been systematically counted for less than two decades. Little is known about many of Britain’s 18 bat species, some of which exist in perilously low numbers. Today they are threatened perhaps more than they’ve ever been by the loss of their insect prey, the conversion of old barns and derelict buildings in which they roost, and the bright lights of new suburbs, wind farms and speeding vehicles that bamboozle or kill them.The unexpected reappearance of the greater mouse-eared bat in its West Sussex tunnel, in 2002, was a symbol of hope. Against the odds, bats are surviving in our human-dominated land and, perhaps more than any other wild animal, they are constantly surprising us.Bats are great survivors. The oldest known fossil of a bat, found in a quarry in Wyoming in 2003, is about 52.5m years old. Bats have been evolving for so long, and with so many specialised attributes, from echolocation to drastically extended forelimbs, that the order of Chiroptera – “winged hands” in Latin – accounts for one in five species of mammal. They are supremely successful animals. As one expert puts it: when you have been evolving for so long, you’ve perfected the business of being a bat.That business is becoming tricker in a human-dominated world. In older times, they were feared and despised. Modern people may be more tolerant, but even beneficent parts of society – from harvesters of renewable energy to vicars – are often hostile to bats. Energy-efficient homes seal up roof spaces where bats once roosted. New roads – and the planned route of the HS2 railway – block traditional foraging routes. LED lighting is particularly disturbing for bats. Wind farms chop them up: according to a study published in 2016, researchers using sniffer dogs to find and retrieve bat carcasses calculated that 29 onshore windfarms killed 194 dead bats per month – a kill-rate that would dispatch 80,000 bats a year across Britain, without accounting for migrating bats taken out by the rapidly expanding rows of offshore turbines.Earlier this year, members of the House of Lords spoke in favour of a bill that seeks to remove bats’ legal protection in churches unless there is a “significant” adverse impact on rare bat populations. The Bishop of Norwich blamed barn conversions for driving bats into churches, with more than half of 12,000 listed churches housing roosts of bats. Worshippers had “come to the end of their tether,” warned the bishop, because of bat droppings despoiling brasses, fabrics and fittings. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, the Movement Against Bats in Churches – founded by a vicar’s wife – campaigned to eliminate the blight of bats. Is there another animal in Britain that has a dedicated protest movement against it?Bats that overcome these challenges can live a long time. Only 19 mammal species are longer-lived relative to their body size than humans, and all but one of these are bats. (The other is the naked mole rat.) And of these unusually durable mammals, the greater mouse-eared bat is one of the longest-lived of all: it can clock up more than 35 years. Scientists recently discovered that its longevity is probably due to the fact that, unlike most mammals, its telomeres – a string-like material at the end of its chromosomes – do not shorten with age. They hope further insights from the unique biology of Myotis myotis may one day help humans live longer.Time passes in a different way for such a long-lived animal, and so it seems with its s. I first contacted natural scientist and bat expert Tony Hutson in early 2017, and it was more than a year before he agreed to take me to see the bat. Hutson, a retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, is wary of any interference in the creature’s peaceful existence. Each month of winter, Hutson and other local recorders count the bats hibernating in several old railway tunnels, and each month I begged to be allowed to tag along. After the bat was inspected without me in December, January and February, finally Hutson agreed that I could accompany them on an extra trip they would undertake in March, with a big caveat: they didn’t normally inspect the bat so late in winter, and could not guarantee it would still be hanging there.Hutson is the second in a short lineage of champions of the greater mouse-eared bat. The first was a wildlife-loving tea-planter from Ceylon called Captain William Watt Addison Phillips. Phillips grew up in Staffordshire during the reign of Queen Victoria, and headed to Colombo to become a tea-planter when he was 19. Living among the civets, leopards and sloth bears of Ceylon, he catalogued its natural history and published papers including “On the habits of the Ceylon Gerbil”.After retiring, Phillips conducted a survey of the flora and fauna of the Males for the Natural History Museum before settling in Bognor Regis in 1959, just after the first greater mouse-eared bat frenzy. Phillips remained active and insatiably curious in retirement, taking an interest in every kind of animal and plant around him. He was also lucky: one day he found a grey long-eared bat – Britain’s second-rarest species – sprawled on his dustbin. It was dead. Some years later, Phillips explored some derelict railway tunnels in Sussex with his grandson. In one, they were delighted to discover a small colony of greater mouse-eared bats. Bearing in mind the old shooting aficionado’s adage, “What hits is history, what’s missed is mystery,” Phillips shouldered his gun, brought down a couple and donated the specimens to the eager curators of the Natural History Museum, who added them to their collections.At the time, Tony Hutson was working as a scientific researcher in the museum and, by chance, had already met Bill Phillips a few years earlier, during an expedition to the Males. Hutson had first become fascinated by bats as a boy, when he saw them above an old priory. He was particularly gripped when he first witnessed the mystery of their motionless hibernation. “That got me – that they will sit there without moving for three or four months,” he says. “How are they doing nothing?” Growing up in south London, he joined a natural history youth group that met at the Natural History Museum as a young man, he applied for a job there. He had a cup of tea with a secretary and asked if he could help its scientists who were studying bats. “They said: ‘No, but we can give you a job in entomology.’” So Hutson cunningly pursued his passion by studying the ectoparasites – such as fleas – that live on bats.As one of the museum’s bat experts, Hutson spent much of his time coaxing irate homeowners not to destroy colonies of rare bats roosting in their roofs. But there were moments of adventure, too. He undertook an expedition to a cave in Ecuador with Erich von Däniken, the Swiss author of Chariots of the Gods, who believed that aliens visited Earth and influenced early human culture. The explorers were winched into the cave by helicopter and the astronaut Neil Armstrong came along. “The theory was that if we did meet any aliens, he would be the best person for them to talk to,” said Hutson. He found no aliens, but they did come across a few interesting bat species.After taking note of Bill Phillips’ surprising discovery of a colony of greater mouse-eared bats in Sussex, Hutson first visited the old railway tunnels in 1974, and saw the bats for himself. “I was working with ectoparasites of bats at the time, so I’d sometimes come down and poke a few around, searching for parasites,” he said. The tunnel was bricked up, with a locked door at one end, to stop visitors from causing a repeat of the scenes that destroyed the Dorset population in the 1950s. (The bats gained access via ventilation grills.) Each year in the 1980s, Hutson unlocked the door and counted the greater mouse-eared bats inside. Each year, their numbers dwindled. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 gave bats and their roosts legal protection for the first time, but then, disaster: one winter, all the female greater mouse-eared bats disappeared from the tunnel. It seemed that their maternity roost – the barn or some other unknown place in Britain where the females raised their young during the summer – must have been destroyed, perhaps in a fire, or by developers. By 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat was declared extinct.But Tony Hutson did not give up. Each winter, he continued to check tunnels and disused mines all over the south of England. Nine years later, his vigilance was vindicated. He heard reports of a live bat found, grounded, in Bognor, and raced to the seaside town. By the time he arrived, this old female bat had died. And it presented another puzzle: it was disabled.“A bat’s forearms are usually the same length, but on this bat they were different lengths,” he remembered. “Whether it spent its life flying around in circles, I’m not sure.” Was there a secret, residual population of mouse-eared bats? It appeared not, for this venerable female showed no sign of ever having bred, and no sign of having communed with any other mouse-eared bats. “There were no parasites on it that it would have picked up from others of its kind, which is what I was looking for,” said Hutson. But the find put him on high alert.At the end of 2002, his annual inspection of the old tunnel where the bats had been found by Captain Bill Phillips in the 1960s revealed a single greater mouse-eared bat. It was a young male, born that spring. Hutson and the protectors placed a silver tag on its elbow and wondered how this species would surprise them next.By March, I was desperate to see this bat. I met Hutson on a murky day in a layby close to the secret tunnel. He had been visiting the bat each month over winter, but offered no crumb of comfort. “Whether he flew off last night, I don’t know,” he said with a twitch of deadpan humour. We set off through a woodland with some fellow bat enthusiasts: Crispin Scott of the National Trust, and Sue Harris and Martin Phillis, volunteer bat recorders for Sussex bat group and part of a network of bat fans who form the Bat Conservation Trust. This small charity is the national voice for bats in Britain, and Hutson revealed, with characteristic modesty, that he helped set it up.We walked down the cutting of an old railway line, sharp lumps of chalk and fallen trees tumbling down the banks. The tiniest trace of people having walked along the cutting worried the protectors. “It’s too open,” said Scott. “We need to fell a couple of trees across here so only people in the know come down.” At the end was a tunnel of red brick, marching into the hillside.At the centre of its bricked-up entrance was an iron hatch. Phillis pulled out a key, unlocked the top and the bottom, and we squeezed inside. The tunnel was cool but not freezing dark but not pitch-black. Daylight shone from the grille above our heads and in the far distance, like a mirage, was a crescent of light, another grille, 680 metres away, at the tunnel’s end.I hadn’t anticipated the water. There was the sound of constant dripping as water oozed through the brick ceiling and hit the stony floor. The bricks glistened with moisture. “Bats need it very humid,” said Hutson. “If it gets too dry, they dehydrate.” There were black stains on curved tunnel walls and ceiling. Only when we later emerged and discovered our faces were streaked with black did I realise that this was archeological soot, from the steam trains that last entered this tunnel in the 1950s.The bat protectors wielded head and hand torches and began by painstakingly sweeping their beams up and down the curved walls of the tunnel, inspecting ginger-coloured fungi, straggly like beards, and searching for the bats that clung in crevices where mortar or brickwork had come away. Different species shared this tunnel. Smaller species may temporarily wake from hibernation to pee or feed if it is mild, but the greater mouse-eared goes deeper into the tunnel and remains motionless for longer. Hutson pointed out the different species, with their distinctive features. The natterer’s bat has long, trumpety ears and a Daz-white belly Daubenton’s bat has big feet, which it uses to grab insects off the surface of ponds. These bats are counted three times each winter for Bat Conservation Trust hibernation surveys.We probably didn’t need to, but we talked in low murmurs. I walked past the bats’ somnolent bodies with the same care I take while tiptoeing into my children’s bedroom when they are sleeping.The first question Hutson asked when he found the mouse-eared bat in 2002 was: where did it go after its winter hibernation? Answer this question, and he might find other members of its tribe. Hutson contacted colleagues in Portugal who better knew its lifestyle and were familiar with its preferred summer habitats. “We organised a big survey, well sort of,” he said. “We met in the pub and looked at prime local habitat. It was a time when they were cutting a lot of hay and these bats often go for freshly cut hay, where they can find more insects.”During summer, the greater mouse-eared bat roosts high in church and castle turrets in northern Europe, and in caves in the south. Hutson looked in old sand and chalk mines, and in disused lime kilns. He asked industrial archeologists and consulted other societies for secretive enthusiasts. “There’s always some nut looking for holes in the ground,” he said. “We combed the region for suitable sites.” The bat group appealed to the media, encouraging people to look for big bats. They collected a hair sample to use DNA to identify its origin, but the lab scientists weren’t able to extract DNA at the time.The broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham came to film the hunt. But there was no trace of the bat or any of its kin. The bat did turn up at the Sussex tunnel the next winter, however, and the winter after that. Hutson considered putting a VHS radio tag on the bat, but was worried that the burden of a tag could kill it, and he would be blamed. “What put me off in the end was if it didn’t turn up again that winter, I’d be drummed out of the country,” he said. In 2007, however, the protectors plucked up the courage to carefully take the bat off the tunnel wall during its hibernation and inspect it. Its teeth were a bit worn, but it was in good health – and very alone. During his inspection of its private parts, Hutson found signs that it had never been sexually active.We were now 300 metres inside the tunnel. A natterer’s was stuffed into a crevice no wider than a centimetre. “He’s awake, isn’t he?” said Hutson, swiftly moving his torch away so as not to disturb it. Then he pointed his torch towards a bat that was noticeably larger than the others: solid, and tea-cup sized. “A very rare bat,” he said, “but not rare enough for you.” A Bechstein’s bat.What of the mouse-eared bat? “He has definitely moved,” said Sue Harris, who had noted his position during their previous inspection, in February. We were in the relatively warm middle of the tunnel, where it was 8.2C, but there was no bat. Harris walked ahead. Suddenly, her methodical movements became frantic. “I can hardly contain my excitement,” she called out.High up, where a whole brick had fallen from the curve of the tunnel wall, hung a large, sandy-coloured bat. A silver ring wrapped around its forearm shone in our torchlight. The greater mouse-eared bat. The natterer’s bats we had seen weighed 8g. This one weighed more than 30g, with a broad pink muzzle, a long, pale underside, and dark-brown wings folded up tight by its side like an umbrella.It would be hard to bond with a creature you only ever saw perfectly still, in a deep sleep, face averted from the world. Was Hutson fond of it? “I shall be sorry when it’s not there, assuming I outlive it,” he said. “You never know – it might have another 20 years to go. It might be having an easy time, no stresses. It looks quite tough, sort of robust.” But Harris was worried. “He’s looking damp, especially around the neck area. He didn’t look at all damp in February,” she said. Droplets of water glistened silver on his fur. His ring looked tarnished.The bat’s unknowability was frustrating but, after 16 years, Hutson had become resigned to the unanswered questions about this inidual, and the fate of the species in Britain. Where does this bat go? Perhaps to France? Are there really no others? “After a few years I wondered if we should have done more in terms of finding others,” said Hutson, “but now I’m convinced it is a loner and whatever we had done wouldn’t have made a difference.” Could they reintroduce the species using wild specimens caught in continental Europe? “The first problem is that they would have to go into quarantine for at least six months because of rabies. After being in captivity for six months they wouldn’t be too good at operating in the wild.”We reached the end of the tunnel. There was no exit, just a solid wall of breezeblocks. The bat seemed less a pioneer, the first of its kind, than a survivor, the last of its kind – like the tunnel, a dead-end.If there really is only one greater mouse-eared bat in Britain, with no possibility of reproduction, then it is as good as extinct. Seven other British bat species exist in such low numbers that no reliable population data exists. But technology such as bat detectors, which reveal bats by the sound of their echolocation, is helping better monitor populations. The Bat Conservation Trust’s systematic monitoring of 10 species since the start of this century has revealed an unexpected picture: nine of these appear to be increasing in number. If true, it is yet another way in which bats have surprised us.But counting bats accurately is difficult, said Mathews. They are usually counted where they are known to roost, but scientists have yet to work out a way of counting the number of roosts in an area. “Unless we know that, it makes it very, very difficult to understand what is going on with the population,” she said. Current threats to bats seem to spring from misunderstanding of both human and bat nature. Today, every bat and every roosting site in the EU is protected by the EU Habitats Directive. But legal protection infuriates many home-owners and developers, and may encourage the furtive destruction of bat colonies.Environmental legislation usually follows a “polluter pays” principle, but with bats, the person providing a home for bats is penalised, and must meet all the expense of surveying and providing alternative sites. The government is promising that after Brexit, public money for farmers will be based on the services they provide for the ecosystem (clean water, fertile soils etc). Mathews wondered whether a similar formula could be applied to homeowners who provide bat services.“You can understand why people find it frustrating when they want to convert their barn and it’s got bats in it and it’s a complete palaver,” she said. “Whoever has a bat roost is providing a service to the rest of the community, so there should be a community effort to make sure the bats are protected.”The second challenge for bats is another visible sign of society’s supposed care for them: the bat bridges that  new roads. These trellises of wires hung between telegraph poles either side of the carriageway are designed to funnel bats up and safely over fast-moving traffic so they are not killed by cars and lorries when they follow their traditional foraging routes across new roads. Unfortunately, they don’t work: bats are still killed by moving vehicles. And there is no funding to monitor how bats use these bridges, if at all, or to test whether there may be a design that does work.Despite the roads, the regulations, the wind turbines and the barn conversions, Mathews feels there are grounds for optimism for Britain’s rarest bat. The greater mouse-eared bat may have dipped in and out of extinction in Britain, but after decades of decline in northern Europe, the species is on the rise again in countries such as Austria. She believes it might be possible to find out more about the lonely bat’s mysterious life. “My first question was: why don’t we put a GPS tag on it?” she said. “It’s already 16. It’s now or never. We don’t want to intervene and hasten the demise of this animal – it’s that burden of responsibility – , but on the other hand, it does seem a rather wasted opportunity not to find out anything else about it. If it had been me, I would’ve been blitzing the place looking for evidence of greater mouse-eared bats, and I don’t think anybody has.” A new scientific review of British mammal populations states that it is “plausible” that other iniduals are present, and could be revealed by exhaustive searches of potential summer roosting locations, or sites where they “swarm” in autumn.Mathews will start doing just that this summer, putting out special nets – such as a harp trap, a large frame with strings between it which cause a bat to drop unharmed into a collection chamber below. “The same species on the continent is often found in churches and castles and big buildings. We could start looking at these sorts of places. We could also do DNA analysis of historic droppings. Perhaps it does go to France every summer and comes back? Surely it won’t be the only one doing that? We could do some more work in the autumn, when these bats exhibit swarming behaviour. If there are others in the area that happen not to hibernate in the tunnel, it’s possible they may turn up at that time of year.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5391af7a9217c46f3e286c5b3a6acc8bc5ff1b89/0_0_3603_2373/master/3603.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd351548b775ce2b308248816813d90f 700w","title":"arron banks tells mps i have no business interests in russia","story":"Brexiter questioned about where his £9m of backing for leave campaign came fromArron Banks has told MPs he thought it would be worthwhile meeting a Russian businessman fronting a goldmining deal, at the suggestion of the country’s ambassador to the UK, and only pulled out after being warned not to become more deeply involved.Banks told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee he reasoned it was worth attending the initial meeting with Siman Povarenkin, but was then advised to “be circumspect” about further involvement by the former chief of the general staff Lord Guthrie and the businessman Peter Hambro. “I met with him, I’m a businessman, why shouldn’t I? I thought it was interesting,” Banks said. After the warnings, he added, the deal fell away. “I have no business in Russia, I have done no business deals in Russia.”Questions about the Brexit donor’s engagement with the deal came towards the end of an often tense three-hour hearing, that came days after a leaked cache of emails from Banks suggested his contacts with Russian officials in the UK were deeper than thought.Banks eventually walked out of the hearing, refusing to answer five more minutes of questions because he had a lunch with the Democratic Unionist party MPs Ian Paisley Jr and Sammy Wilson and had previously been told the proceedings were close to a conclusion.Appearing alongside the Leave.EU communications director, Andy Wigmore, Banks also denied visiting Russia in February 2016 to progress the mining deal as the leak had suggested, and he presented the committee with copies of both of his passports, which he said showed there was no visa stamp around that date. The two witnesses said that when Wigmore had emailed a journalist at the time to suggest Banks was in Russia and unavailable, he was being mischievous and lying.At another point, Banks said it was not uncommon for he and Wigmore to exaggerate to try to gain an advantage with plausible stories. “We certainly weren’t afraid of leading journalists up the country path, the same with politicians,” he said. “Journalists are the cleverest, stupidest people on earth. They are clever, but they want to believe some of this stuff.”After the hearing, the committee chairman, Damian Collins, said: “Banks and Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand. So it is difficult for the committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high-ranking Russian officials.”The suggestion that Banks meet Povarenkin followed a meeting with Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, in November 2015. Banks told MPs he went to meet him because he had been invited at the prompting of Wigmore, who also acted as a trade envoy for Belize.Giles Watling, a Conservative MP on the committee, asked Banks: “I’d like to move on to big, scary Russia. I get the point that if the Russian ambassador asks you round for a drink you go, but this relationship went on for quite some time. What were you hoping to get out of it?” Banks initially replied: “A good lunch, and that’s what I got.” This prompted Watling to ask if there were in fact “many good lunches”, to which Banks said: “Many good lunches.”He had previously said in the book The Bad Boys of Brexit that he attended one “six-hour boozy lunch” with the Russian ambassador in November 2015, several months before the Brexit vote, at which they drank vodka supposedly distilled for Joseph Stalin.Banks and Wigmore also told MPs they had passed a phone number for the Trump transition team to Yakovenko at another lunch they had with him in November 2016, a few days after their visit to Trump Tower when they met the then president-elect after waiting in the building for six hours. “What’s wrong with that? We gave them a telephone number,” Banks said.He said he asked her “what if somebody wants to get in touch with you?” and she replied: “Here’s a number, you can give them that.”Earlier it emerged Banks had lodged an appeal against the Electoral Commission over its decision to fine Leave.EU £70,000 for breaching spending limits. Collins told the committee that as a result it would not be possible for the MPs to explore related areas. The commission is also conducting a separate inquiry into the “true source” of Banks’ loans and donations to Leave.EU and Ukip, which amount to at least £9m.  The hearing began with an attempt by the two men to unbalance Collins by pointing out that according to the register of members’ interests he had received hospitality and two tickets from Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea to watch a game against Crystal Palace. “In the light of hospitality from Putin’s No 1 man in London, you might recuse yourself,” Wigmore said.Collins told the witnesses it was a “nice try” but that although he had watched the match he had not met Abramovich. He went on to say he “wasn’t offered Stalin’s vodka” and had “no shares in goldmines”, and in response to a suggestion from Banks he added that there were “no honey traps”.

A speech cut off in mid-sentence due to an arbitrary time limit set by the government, and the chief whip darting around the chamber desperately pleading with Tory rebels not to defeat the government over a meaningful vote.The solicitor general making up government policy on the hoof while making plea bargain concessions in public to Dominic Grieve. A government that can barely negotiate with itself, let alone the EU. Hundreds of MPs milling around, unsure of what had and hadn’t been agreed. The rebels reckoned they had a deal, while a government minister briefed that they had been stitched up. A shambles. AKA strong and stable leadership in the national interest.The proceedings had started slowly with a visibly bored David Davis merely going through the motions. The Brexit secretary increasingly gives the impression he has realised the whole process is far more difficult than he first thought, and that he is hopelessly out of his depth. He barely makes the effort to make eye contact with anyone in the chamber and sticks rigidly to a script that he doesn’t fully understand.The Lords amendments were all a bit of a fuss about nothing, he mumbled. Unwanted interference from people who just didn’t like Brexit. Sure, some of their suggestions had been helpful in their way, but there had been far too many of them so he had to draw the line somewhere. And that somewhere was that he’d decided to reject them all on the grounds they weren’t sensible. The idea that Davis is the man to judge if something is sensible or not is a disturbing thought.“There is no mechanism for a meaningful vote on a no-deal scenario,” intervened Grieve, a former attorney general and one of the sharper minds on either side of the house. Davis merely looked bewildered. “A meaningful vote is just an excuse to reverse the Brexit process,” he said. Grieve tried to explain that there were plenty of better ways to stop Brexit if that had been the intention, but gave up once it was clear the lights were on but no one was at home in Davis’s brain.After Ken Clarke had succinctly summed up the government’s position as “Oh House of Commons, get lost”, and observed that the EU was perfectly capable of realising the UK didn’t have a clue what it was doing without needing the British parliament to point it out to them, Grieve tried to spell out the details of his proposed amendments in more detail. “The irrationality of the debate has been chilling,” he said testily.By now Davis had been gagged and replaced on the government benches by Robert Buckland, the solicitor general. Buckland was more alive to the possibility of the disaster of a government defeat and immediately started bouncing up and down to offer a few concessions. First, he was really going to think about things in a structured way. When Grieve laughed him off, he came up with something a bit more definite. Buckland would give way on clauses A and B. Again, Grieve batted him away. Clause C was the crucial one.Just two days previously, the government had been briefing it was going to win the vote at a canter. Now it was clear its maths was fairly hopeless and the chief whip darted around the benches begging Tory rebels not to make Theresa May look any more useless than she already did. He got short shrift and as Philip Lee, the junior justice minister who had resigned that morning so he could vote against the government, stood up to speak, the solicitor general leapt up again. “I need more time to think,” he sobbed.More time meant the 15 or so Tory rebels – minus the luckless Lee – being summoned from the chamber for a tête-à-tête with the prime minister. Whatever she said to them appeared to have done the trick, as first Jonathan Djanogly and then Antoinette Sandbach stood up to say they would be backing the government after being given assurances that Grieve’s amendments would be taken seriously after all.The session ended in chaos. Anna Soubry appeared suspicious, but Grieve reassured her they were going to get what they wanted. Almost immediately, prominent Brexiters were claiming they wouldn’t. Not for the first time May appeared to have promised different things to both sides. Indecision and ambivalence are the only things at which she excels. But something has to give. And it’s going to get messy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed38b66ff9ddda693fa9a801c032809cd8629c46/0_140_5396_3238/master/5396.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4033020aecf76da0b31e1e132e79c917 1000w","title":"how did your mp vote on the meaningful vote amendment","story":"The government has blocked a key Lords amendment on giving parliament a “meaningful vote” on Brexit.Only two Conservative MPs – Anna Soubry and Kenneth Clarke – voted against their party after significant concessions prevented an all-out Tory rebellion.

I still feel as if I am super strong. But whenever I try to sprint or jump I have to take three days off because I am limping so much. In the end it wears you down.”Suddenly it all comes rushing out: how the long jumper has been wrestling with retirement for three months because of an injury to his left ankle how he has gone through the five stages of grief – from denial, anger, bargaining and depression to, finally, acceptance and then, for the first time, how he will definitely end his career this summer.“I keep asking myself, what’s more important to me – trying to be a mediocre athlete holding on to past glories or moving on?” he says with unflinching honesty. “I’ll be 32 later this year. I don’t want to be the old man on the team who is making up the numbers. I want people to remember me for the good times.”There have certainly been plenty of those along the way – including, of course, that London 2012 gold medal, sandwiched neatly between those of Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah, during 46 minutes of cacophony and wild delirium at London’s Olympic Stadium.The internet snarks and fly-by-night fans dismissed his performance on an instantly anointed Super Saturday as a fluke. Rutherford’s response? To recover from a career-threatening hamstring rupture to win Commonwealth and European gold and set the British record of 8.51m in 2014 – and then, for good measure, to claim the world and Diamond League titles a year later. It made him the first British athlete to hold all the major outdoor titles at the same time. He was not finished there either, winning European gold and Olympic bronze in 2016, to confirm his status in the pantheon as one of Britain’s greatest track and field stars.Along the way, however, his body has broken down more times than he can remember. And even totting up all his operations takes some calculating. “I have had four surgeries on my right ankle and one on my left,” he says, sipping a large coffee. “Then there was the groin reconstruction, which is as painful as it sounds, as well as having my stomach wall knitted back together. I’ve had my foot opened up, too. And earlier in my career I had all sorts of hamstring problems as well.”He had hoped that the surgeon’s knife would work its magic on his left ankle last autumn but a pernicious problem with the cartilage refuses to budge.“As an athlete you often have pain, whether it’s training niggles or serious injuries, but with my ankle it is like having a dull toothache all the time,” he says. “I just don’t want to be in pain every single day of my life, which is how things currently are.”In the past Rutherford would sprint in training three or four times a week as well as jumping once or twice. His injuries, however, mean that he trains mostly on an exercise bike and has to restrict his jumping into a sandpit to competition this summer. No wonder, then, that his best leap in 2018 is only 7.89m. Yet while the prognosis is gloomy, he still hopes for a final shot at glory at this year’s European championships in Berlin.“I would love the opportunity to become the first man to win three successive European long jump titles,” he says. “And if I think I can win, I will go. But I am also going to be realistic. If my form isn’t there, I won’t stand in any British athlete’s way.”Rutherford will, however, definitely compete at the Anniversary Games in London next month and the Birmingham Diamond League in August. “Making this decision now gives me enough time to compete around the country and say thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout my career,” he explains.Yet Rutherford is worried about the state of the sport he is about to leave behind. “It’s probably a sign of the times that more people want to talk to me about Strictly Come Dancing than athletics,” he says. “Can you imagine that happening in the era of Seb Coe and Steve Ovett, or even Sally Gunnell and Linford Christie? Back then the sport was always on the BBC and on the back pages. Now nobody cares about athletics.“At the weekend a 19-year-old Cuban, Juan Miguel Echevarria, jumped 8.83m in Stockholm – the longest since 1995 – and yet no one knows about it. The guy almost went out of the pit and could easily become the first athlete to jump nine metres. Everyone should be raving about him.”When asked if British Athletics has squandered the legacy of London 2012, he nods. “To a certain degree, yes,” he continues. “There was a period of time where they were relying on Jess, Mo and myself to carry on winning medals – and we did – but they have not promoted the other kids coming through enough. Unfortunately we have a professional sport run by amateurs.”Rutherford points to the likes of Dina Asher-Smith, who broke her British record last week, Zharnel Hughes, who ran 9.91sec at the weekend, and Sophie Hitchon, who won an Olympic hammer bronze in Rio, as athletes who should be better known. “But if you asked people in this coffee shop who they were, I’m not sure they would know.”Some of the blame, he believes, lies with athletes for not speaking out more. “Many of them seem to have almost a fear of revealing their personalities,” he said. “I can be chatting away to them, yet I see them five minutes later when the camera is on them they have nothing to say. It drives me crazy.“They can’t figure out that by being outspoken, and having things to say, it will promote the sport. I tell young athletes that without them there is no track and field, so they should be more forthright in evoking change. Because if you don’t, you are just going to be happy\u0026nbspliving your 10 years as a British athlete, retiring and having to get a normal job, which is what so many do.”Rutherford, however, has never been one to follow the herd. He has several retirement plans lined up – including TV and training work. But he has not completely given up on remaining in elite sport and has even talked to British Cycling about travelling to Manchester for testing later this year.“I used to do a lot of BMX as a kid and I’ve been a mountain biker all my life, so the idea of seeing what I can do on a track bike really appeals,” he says. “Of course I am realistic but, given I can produce a very large amount of power on a Watt bike, I want to see what I can do.“I know some people will dismiss the idea but I can’t understand the negativity,” he adds. “After all, other athletes have switched sports. Look at Marquise Goodwin, who was a London 2012 finalist in the long jump and is now an NFL wide receiver. I do a lot of bike workouts at the moment and it doesn’t hurt my body. So why not give it a go? The people I’ve spoken to at British Cycling have not said, ‘no chance’. They’ve said ‘try’. So I am going to do some lab testing.”Rutherford made his decision to retire only this week and, when asked what his legacy will\u0026nbspbe, he exhales loudly. “Oof! I hope people will see me as somebody who was always able to produce his best when it mattered most – an athlete who had a dogged determination to win, no matter who I was up against.”For someone who was frequently dismissed as a fluke, he sure got lucky a lot of times. He laughs. “What was it that Gary Player said? ‘The more I train, the luckier I get.’”His voice suddenly goes quiet. “I have always had the tendency to put my career down, probably because I had this desire to always prove people wrong,” he admits. “But if you had told me 10 years ago I would be a five-time major winner, I would have bitten your hand off. I\u0026nbspam very content with everything I\u0026nbsphave achieved. It’s the right time to\u0026nbspmove\u0026nbspon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c137f0196834f81b8fc1b15d7bdab96eccee46d7/0_271_4765_2859/master/4765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2071498ea3474d24dfe7b96cd80ae73e","title":"tiger woods us open golf traffic","story":"The US Open’s attachment to controversy continues not only apace but in various forms. This, the 118th staging of the major, has included its most famous participant warning that players may miss tee times because of traffic chaos in the vicinity of the course.An abundance of recent and high‑profile US Open matters include widespread criticism of course conditions at Chambers Bay in 2015 and a rules abomination featuring the 2016 champion, Dustin Johnson. The tournament’s last visit here, in 2004, became infamous for borderline unplayable greens during round four.Given Woods is not prone to loose comment, this will be interpreted as a high-profile warning to the United States Golf Association. Woods is staying on his $20m yacht – named Privacy – docked in nearby Sag\u0026nbspHarbour. Presuming he can properly negotiate the daily route to Shinnecock, Woods will seek to end a major victory wait that started after this event in 2008.Twelve months ago he was in the early stages of recuperation from a fourth back surgery. In May 2017 he was arrested on a driving under the influence charge. Asked how his life had change since the latter, embarrassing event, his answer was curt. “It has gotten better,” he said.The 42-year-old was more expansive on the changes to his professional situation since the last US Open, which he watched on television. “There’s really was no expectation to have the thought that I could be here again. I was just given the OK to start walking again, start moving around so I hadn’t been cleared to start lifting yet. It was about just having my standard of life. Forget golf. Can I participate in my kids’ lives again? That’s something that I had missed for a few years and that was the main goal of it.His prospects have been endorsed by Jordan Spieth. Woods and Spieth played a practice round here on Sunday, with the Texan suitably impressed. “He’s playing good enough golf to win a tournament at any point in time,” he said.“Nobody would ever count out probably the most clutch putter and short-game player of all time and then he’s striking the ball extremely well, the rounds I’ve played with him. He’s hitting the driver long and straight, working it both ways. It’s a matter of time in my opinion.”Woods reflected on a bittersweet year when he has finished second at the Valspar Championship and been in contention to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational but failed to challenge at the Masters. “There’s two ways of looking at that,” he said. “I’ve given myself chances to win. Then again I’m not happy with the fact that I didn’t win because I loved how it felt being there.“I’ve had my opportunities. I’m very thankful to have had those opportunities. I didn’t know if I was going to have them again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8632c3f61a70773cce5e44cf9bc75049ac79993a/190_293_3407_2044/master/3407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=151dd014b7593af7a36e4940e197fd0c","title":"notes from the field anna deavere smith interview","story":"Compiled from three years’ worth of interviews, Anna Deavere Smith’s Notes from the Field confronts the criminal justice system and inequality in the USFour storeys above the chaos of a blistering summer afternoon on Manhattan’s Eighth Avenue, Anna Deavere Smith sits in silence. The acclaimed American playwright and actor – who played Nancy McNally on The West Wing – glances at the rehearsal room floor, draws breath and begins the opening monologue of her one-woman show, Notes from the Field, assuming the voice of famed civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill.“It is impossible to talk about the criminal justice system, mass incarceration, without talking about education,” Smith says, capturing both the matter-of-fact exasperation and scholarly expertise you can imagine the NAACP Legal Defence Fund’s veteran president exuding.The monologue is one of 19 speeches that make up the 90-minute show – all verbatim extracts from interviews Smith conducted herself or speeches made in public, which explore the uniquely American phenomenon of the school-to-prison pipeline. The play is her first appearance in London for more than 25 years, and won critical acclaim when it was performed off-Broadway in 2016, including from President Barack Obama.America incarcerates almost a quarter of the global prison population, with by far the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. The prison-industrial complex began during Nixon’s war on drugs and has continued to proliferate ever since, giving rise to a system that disproportionately punishes people of colour. Feeding into this dysfunction is a public school system, increasingly punitive and over-policed, that feeds the machine with young adults – disproportionately black and brown – abandoned by formal education. Smith’s work seeks to engage this dark trend with a group of characters carefully chosen from more than 250 interviews the playwright conducted around America over a period of roughly three years. It is the latest in her On the Road series, encompassing more than a dozen plays using verbatim interviews as the foundation for drama. She flits between young people caught at the harsh end, and teachers, judges, activists and politicians who see the problem from different personal and historical vantages. The performance combines these perspectives with live musical accompaniment and video clips documenting the contemporary events her subjects are grappling with. It is an extraordinary accomplishment, which provides a rich exploration of the subject through deeply personal narratives. But how does she think audiences in London will engage with such a raw, perhaps alien, exposé of contemporary America, when the play comes to the Royal Court this month? “I’m honoured to be invited, but I haven’t pursued London since that time as a place to go with my work, because I’m very mission-driven,” she says. “I’ve thought maybe I’m just too American. I’m very aware of my mission in America, my place in America.” She recognises, of course, that the UK has long faced its own entrenched prejudice within the criminal justice system, albeit on a scale that is dwarfed by the juggernaut of American inequality. And she suggests a meaningful run in London, at a theatre located in one of the most affluent boroughs in the city, is ultimately about raising awareness. “I would say that success in London would be if anyone’s concerned, and concerned enough to see how that plays out in England. Racism is not unique to the United States.”There is a pang of sadness watching Notes from the Field, recorded as a live action movie for HBO, in the era of the Trump presidency. The play was researched throughout the Obama years and, although its subject matter touches on some of the darkest moments in his presidency – from the racist massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, to the riots in Baltimore – it is a reminder that the nation’s first black president had actively engaged with the need for sweeping reform of America’s broken criminal justice system.Trump, who branded himself the “law and order candidate”, has already taken significant measures to roll back any of the progress made by the previous administration and appointed former Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, who has had to deny allegations of racism, to be his attorney general. Smith says the play has not been significantly altered since it was first performed in the Obama years. “I’ve always had a sense of purpose with this project. So, I don’t think that’s changed because Trump is president. He’s not helping the plight of poor kids, and he’s not helping the disparity between rich and poor, and he’s not helping our situation with regard to what punishment has become in this country at all. But the problems were here before Trump.”And yet, she says, certain points within the work now carry a different weight. A closing moment sees the actor assume the role of congressman John Lewis, the civil rights veteran brutally beaten by police officers during civil disobedience in Selma, reflecting on a moment of reconciliation with one of the officers there that day in 1965.“Hold on. Never give up. Never give in. Never lose faith. Keep the faith,” she says as Lewis. The intensity of the performance leads her to what she describes as a “monkish existence” during runs. She avoids loud places, won’t kiss or hug anyone after shows, and mostly heads straight home to bed – all in a bid to keep free of germs, preserve the quality of her voice, and sit with the weight of the stories she is telling.Smith, who received a George Polk award – one of America’s highest journalism honours – for her body of work last year, is nonetheless uncomfortable with the label of a journalist. “You’re supposed to be objective,” she says to me, forthrightly bashing her fists on the desk we’re sitting at. “So you can’t call yourself an art form, even if it’s beautiful and it has that aesthetic value. But I can say that I’m looking for metaphors to reveal the truth. I don’t have to say I’ve found the truth. You do.” She accepts though that her research methods bear a similarity to the journalistic process itself: travelling long distances, booking in interviews as the trip unfolds and speaking to people about the most desperate, difficult moments in their lives. I tell her that the play had a profound effect on me in a way that theatre rarely does. Many of the events included were stories I covered on the ground. Some of the characters in her work are people I have interviewed, too, and it brought up feelings of residual trauma associated with covering the endless cycle of violence and brutality in American society. As a reporter there is a tendency, as I have experienced, to lose the ability to empathise with your subjects, and I wonder if it’s something she feels, too? “The compassion fatigue is something very, very serious,” she says. “In my case, I respect what I’m carrying. I know it’s not light. But I’ve been training to carry it for my whole life. You know, it’s rough.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ab6e137aec22f53629acdd96e8e40fa0c9363a1/0_304_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb534450c802887180edbfdd6103bd3e","title":"10 best surf schools in world portugal hawaii south africa norway","story":"What sets these surf schools apart is a commitment to excellence when it comes to tuition, which will help you to catch a wave from Portugal to Hawaii, South Africa to Norway Surf camps provide a taste of the surfing lifestyle and include accommodation and transport, as well as social activities where you can meet other surfers.

First indications were that the incident was not terror-related.The hostage-taker reportedly entered the building at 45 Rue des Petites Écuries at around 4pm local time on Tuesday, pretending to be a food delivery courier.He hit one man, who managed to flee. A pregnant woman also managed to escape and was being treated for shock by ambulance services on the scene. The hostages were reportedly held in the internal courtyard of the building, which contains a mix of offices and residential apartments. Within minutes of being alerted, police, French special forces with anti-explosive robots, the fire brigade and ambulance services had surrounded the building.Police sealed off the area and evacuated the Rue des Petites Écuries.The man who escaped confirmed to police that the hostage-taker had punched him in the face. The assailant reportedly told police negotiators he had a letter that he wished to give to the Iranian ambassador with the request that the ambassador handed it over to the French authorities.Around 8pm local time, Paris police officials confirmed the man had been arrested and the hostages released “safe and sound” but shocked. The suspect had reportedly drenched one of the hostages and the room he was holding them in with petrol.Shortly before 8pm, the French interior minister Gérard Collomb tweeted: “The inidual has been arrested and the hostages are out of danger. I salute the professionalism and reaction of the police and emergency services and in particular the BRI of the police prefecture and the Paris fire service whose support was decisive.”A witness living in the building confirmed police had taken away the suspected hostage-taker, wearing a mask and black clothing. According to BFM TV, police officials said the hostage-taker’s claims were “confused” and that he had evoked Iran, Islam, 11 September and the recent murder of a young girl. The channel reported that he is a 27-year-old with no known terrorist links who is unknown to the police and intelligence services and is not on the Fiché S list of potential security threats.

He will travel to Peru’s first game, in the city of Saransk, by overnight bus because there were no train or plane tickets available. But he said getting around Moscow, using a combination of Uber and the metro, had been surprisingly straightforward.Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium will host both Thursday’s opening match and the final on 15 July. In between, there will be 10 further games played in the capital, shared between Luzhniki and the Spartak stadium. It is the biggest event hosted in the Russian capital since the 1980 Olympics.During the coming month, much of the spotlight will be on smaller Russian cities not used to hosting major events and unknown to most foreign visitors. But Moscow also has a chance to project a new image as a modern European capital, crafted through extensive renovations and urban planning programmes over the past few years.“It’s a chance to show everyone that Moscow is not bears on the streets and balalaikas,” said Alexander Polyakov, director of the government institute that oversees the Moscow transport network, voicing a widely held belief that foreign concerns about Russia are due to unfair prejudice and ignorance rather than Russia’s behaviour on the world stage.Some of those visiting may not expect to find a modern metropolis with a pleasant city centre. But under the mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow has changed perhaps more than any other city in Europe over the past few years. Dozens of streets have been fully pedestrianised, pavements have been widened to include bike lanes and more space for those on foot, and a number of parks have been renovated and spruced up.Much of the renovation has been carried out without public consultation, amid allegations of corruption and, in the case of the pavement renovations, often at the cost of extreme inconvenience to Muscovites. But there is little doubt that the result is a city centre that is unrecognisable from a decade ago. Stalinist architecture and monuments still give the city an imposing feel, but at ground level everything has become more humane. “The atmosphere in Moscow is different the streets have a different rhythm. Now it’s pleasant and convenient to walk in Moscow,” said the deputy mayor, Maxim Liksutov.The cafe and restaurant scene has been transformed, with hipster eateries and artisan coffee now more in evidence than Soviet-style canteens.Officials are at pains to stress just how welcoming the city will be for foreign visitors during the World Cup. Liksutov pointed out work on the metro and other transport systems in recent months to ensure all signs and announcements are bilingual. Public transport will be free on match days for those with tickets, and the entire metro system will run until 3am after late games. The city government has launched an app in six languages to help visitors and has provided free English-language lessons to 5,000 of the city’s 50,000 licensed taxi drivers. There are other potential pitfalls for visitors, despite the good intentions. While Russian authorities have reduced visa requirements for those with tickets, they have not waived the cumbersome requirement to register with police, a formality for those staying in hotels but a potential nightmare for the hundreds of thousands of fans who will stay in rented apartments. There also remain concerns over potential racism or hooliganism, though the early fan experience suggests problems of an altogether more benign kind.“Everyone is really friendly and I can’t go anywhere without people trying to have their photo taken with me,” said Carlos, the Peru fan. “I’m thinking I should start charging for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6deda3ed8d45d6db9a52ac974afa26d42274f0b/0_169_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d0cfd6202b9e54356b3c00038aafcb","title":"populist talkshows fuel rise of far right german tv bosses told","story":"Political shows’ negative focus on Islam erodes social cohesion, says cultural councilThe head of Germany’s most powerful cultural body has called for the plug to be pulled on the nation’s multitude of political talkshows for a year, arguing that their populist agenda has helped fuel the rise of the far right.Olaf Zimmermann, who heads the German cultural council, an umbrella group for organisations from art galleries to television companies, said public broadcasters needed to step back and rethink a format that has helped cement gloom-ridden public attitudes towards refugees and Islam, and propelled the Alternative für Deutschland party into parliament at last September’s election.“I’d suggest for them, take a break for a year ... though the length of the intermission isn’t the decisive factor. What is crucial is that they return with new talkshow concepts and try to come up with more suitable contents with regards to social cohesion in our society,” Zimmermann said, arguing that the public broadcasters ARD and ZDF were obsessed with refugee-related issues, often framing them negatively.The cultural council, which is taxpayer funded, has pointed out that since 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis when almost a million refugees and migrants entered Germany, more than 100 political talk shows have put a topic related to migration at the centre of their discussion.Since September’s election, which saw the AfD enter the Bundestag for the first time, much debate has surrounded the extent to which framing an issue, or lending a topic a certain perspective, might have helped their cause.Television analysts have argued that the issue of refugees has been dealt with in a mostly negative way.TV bosses have defended their formats, admitting the intensity of the refugee debate led to the topic being far more widely discussed in 2015 and 2016 than ever before, but arguing that it was no longer a dominant theme.Even last week, however, ARD’s main talkshow Hart Aber Fair - Hard But Fair - led with the question: “To what extent is it possible to integrate young men who have fled from war and archaic societies? How unsafe is Germany as a result of them?”The programme was triggered by the murder of a 14-year-old German girl whose body was discovered in Wiesbaden last week. The 20-year-old Iraqi man suspected of her rape and murder was extradited from Iraq to Germany this week to face trial.Zimmermann said in too many cases refugees were unfairly presented as a threat to German society. The production team of Hart Aber Fair said it rejected the accusation that they had unfairly labelled all refugees as dangerous. “As journalists we find the concept of framing alien to us. We are simply trying to represent the issues which are occupying people, for what they are,” they said.A recent talkshow moderated by the veteran host Sandra Maischberger was advertised in TV listings with the title: “Are we too tolerant towards Islam?” Critics were quick to pounce on the word “we” as being problematic because it suggested “them and us”. The programme’s title was swiftly changed to: The Islam debate: where does our tolerance end?Other recent talkshow topics included ones entitled Refugees and criminality, and Beethoven or Burka?Kai Hafez, a media analyst, said that immigration was rarely presented in talkshows as anything other than negative. “The viewers get used to these negative expressions, and long-term that way the rightwing populists manage to press their points home,” he told Der Spiegel.For their part, the AfD – whose representatives are relative newcomers on the talkshow circuit, the party only having been founded in 2014 – have been deeply critical of the extent to which they are excluded from TV debates.Last week that impression was only intensified after Alexander Gauland, the party’s leader, had his invitation to appear on Hart Aber Fair withdrawn in protest at his description of the Nazi era as the equivalent of “a bird shit” in the context of “more than 1,000 years of successful German history”.AfD supporters reacted to the ban with fury on social media, calling it part of a campaign to squeeze the party off the airwaves.Typically a German talkshow concentrates on a single topic for 60 to 90 minutes. Guests invariably include media representatives, at least one member of the cabinet and opposition politicians.Many media watchers have long been critical of the extent to which the arguably tired and unimaginative format dominates German television, accusing programme makers of choosing it because it is cheap – despite Germany having one of the highest licence fees in the world – and blaming it in part for the dramatic fall in viewers in recent years.Controllers of the broadcasters have hit back. “We believe the talk shows are an enriching part of our programming,” Rainald Becker, the editor-in-chief of the ARD told Die Welt. “Of course we discuss Islam now and then, but we also have other topics such as housing, the collapse of bee colonies or the shortage of carers.“And to those who want to complain, I say to them: you know that there’s an off switch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/739bd2f1d51c6126f41e688abfa2dc99197d62d5/0_0_4960_2977/master/4960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b13bcdf9bbbc762966150586c0f23c","title":"wednesday briefing the general public has a right to know","story":"Push to widen freedom of information laws in wake of Grenfell … Kim Jong-un was the big winner in Singapore … and couple ‘fell to death while taking selfie’Push to widen freedom of information laws in wake of Grenfell … Kim Jong-un was the big winner in Singapore … and couple ‘fell to death while taking selfie’Hello – Warren Murray with you at the halfway point of the week.The government is being urged to adopt changes to freedom of information laws that might have exposed fire safety failings before the Grenfell Tower disaster. Housing associations including the body that managed Grenfell would be made subject to FoI requests under a private member’s bill going before parliament. It would also place firms like Carillion, G4S and Serco under greater public scrutiny.“The general public has a right to know as much about Carillion or Serco when they are given public contracts or providing public services as we do about public authorities doing the same work,” says the Labour MP Andy Slaughter, who is proposing the bill. When Carillion collapsed with the loss of thousands of jobs, there had been little advance notice of its financial vulnerability. And Grenfell residents had tried before the fire to get information but the building’s managers were able to claim exemption as a non-public body.Slaughter, the MP for Hammersmith, has campaigned about high-rise fire risks since a 2016 blaze in a Shepherd’s Bush tower block not far from Grenfell. Other areas that would be subject to FoIs under Slaughter’s bill include local safeguarding children boards, electoral registration officers, returning officers and the housing ombudsman.Quick catch-up - Here is the latest on some developing stories.\u0026gt In news just breaking this morning, Saudi-led forces have launched their threatened assault to reclaim Yemen’s port city of Hodeidah from Houthi rebels.

File photograph: Getty ImagesThe need for major investment by Irish Water to improve the security of public water supplies to comply with health standards and to avoid water restrictions, including boil water notices, is highlighted in the Environmental Protection Agency ’s latest annual report on drinking water.Based on projections by the water utility, the EPA said it expects drinking water to comply with EU standards by 2020, “16 years after the deadline for compliance”.The agency has spelt out a series of national priorities for Irish Water in response to current shortcomings, though it acknowledged monitoring of 883 public drinking water supplies showed 99.9 per cent of samples complied with microbiological standards and 99.6 per cent complied with chemical standards during 2017.It has, nonetheless, set out where water supply problems are most acute, including 72 “at risk” supplies on the EPA’s remedial action list – where the agency deems urgent works need to be undertaken.A total of 52 of these supplies have elevated levels of trihalomethanes (THMs) which arise when organic matter in water combines with chlorine disinfectants. Long-term consumption of THMs is a cancer risk.It found 17 of these supplies lack adequate treatment to prevent the parasite Cryptosporidium entering the water supply. Remedial works for 38 of the supplies are due to be completed by the end of 2018.The main issues affecting Irish water supplies, it concluded, are high levels of disinfection products in supplies excessive levels of pesticide in some supplies and large numbers of lead pipe connections in properties. Irish Water aims to remove “all public-side” lead pipework by 2026. It is the responsibility of property owners to remove any lead pipework within their property.Director of the EPA’s Office of Environmental Enforcement, Gerard O’Leary, confirmed Irish Water plans to have all public drinking water supplies compliant with existing EU public health standards by the end of 2020.“These standards came into force 16 years ago. There are currently 72 supplies where infrastructure is needed to achieve this goal. Continued investment will be required to achieve compliance with current public health standards and new standards expected to be in place by 2020,” he added.Darragh Page of the EPA’s Office of Environmental Enforcement said the incidence of E. coli bacteria in supplies had been on a downward trend for the past 10 years, but in 2017 it was detected at least once in 11 supplies compared to three supplies in 2016, which underlined the need for vigilance.“The best way to ensure our drinking water is free of E. coli is by having a robust disinfection system in place with good checks and controls on the treatment process,” he said.The EPA issued nine legally binding directions to Irish Water during 2017, where it considered there was a risk to human health. It brought a prosecution against the utility which resulted in a fine of €6,000 for persistent THM failures at six treatment plants in Co Donegal.A total of 42 boil water notices and a further four water restrictions were in place in 2017, affecting 21,890 people in 17 counties. Nine public supplies are currently subject to a boil water notice, affecting 12,723 people – the vast majority of those receive water from Lough Talt in Co Sligo (12,260 people). More than half of all boil water notices issued in 2017 were short-term notices, in place for less than 30 days.The EPA Drinking Water Report 2017 and list of public water supplies currently on the remedial action list – including details of proposed remedial measures and timeframes – is available here.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3528445.1528837473!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo removes stigma from consultantoscopies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Leo feels at home in this territory – where he speaks above the heads of politicians in the Dáil chamber and directly to middle Ireland.” Photograph: DominicWireIt is one of those medical procedures people don’t like to talk about. But last year, the Government secretly gave the green light for it to go ahead in Irish hospitals. It’s called a consultantoscopy and it involves monitoring all the movements of top medics using the latest equipment. This examination can go on for a protracted period, although the patient is not conscious at the time that it is happening. But the after-effects can be most unpleasant. The Taoiseach is all for it, though. And he is a qualified doctor.Consultantoscopies are the way forward, and Leo Varadkar told the Dáil in no uncertain terms on Tuesday that this is his deeply held political opinion. As he sees it, hospital consultants contracted by the State to look after public patients should be placed under observation if they start pursuing pay claims while displaying strong symptoms of going private.You could gather this from his robust response to questions from the Fianna Fáil leader about hospital consultants being investigated by detectives hired to establish whether they were neglecting their public obligations if favour of lucrative private work.Micheál Martin said it was “a sinister and dangerous precedent” to have public employees under surveillance by the State. “Who’s next?” he asked. ESB workers, bus drivers, train drivers? Anybody putting in a pay claim? And then, said Micheál, there are questions relating to data protection, invasion of privacy and possible breaches of patient confidentially. Did the Government or specific Ministers know about this strategy to spy on hospital consultants? What sort of contract was signed with private investigators? What guidelines and protocols were they given on how to behave while carrying out surveillance on doctors? How were they able “to check as to whether on-site activity is public or private without potentially breaching the files?” But the thing is, Micheál wasn’t asking about ESB workers or train drivers being spied upon by Big Brother. He was asking about hospital consultants, who aren’t doing too badly on the remuneration front and who might reasonably be expected to turn up and do the public work they have been contracted and paid to do. Although the Fianna Fáil leader posed some valid questions, the Taoiseach knew he was on solid ground when stoutly defending decisions by the departments of health and finance to stick private eyes on the cases of greedy consultants.“This, in my view, is not an unprecedented action,” he declared, listing some examples. Welfare officers check to see “that people are actually genuinely disabled” if they are getting disability or invalidity benefit. Investigators check to make sure people are not claiming welfare while working in the black economy. Tax inspectors “check up on people in all walks of society” to make sure they are tax-compliant. And then the Taoiseach put the fear of God into takeaway owners with the specific example of revenue inspectors “counting the number of chip bags that came out of a chip shop to see how many, whether that person was complying with the law.”Leo sees the hospital consultants as part of this mix.“What I can say is a huge number of consultants in the country work very hard and work well beyond the hours they are contracted to do. They deserve our thanks and respect,” he began, before referring to an RTÉ Investigates programme that showed “there are other consultants who breach their contract and who work full-time in private and public practice, which is impossible”.This is a “serious issue” because these doctors are using State money and time for their own ends “moonlighting in a private hospital when they should be working in a public hospital” and treating people who, in many cases, have been a long, long time on waiting lists. Leo feels at home in this territory – where he speaks above the heads of politicians and commentators in the Dáil chamber and directly to middle Ireland, that cohort he once famously described as the “people who get up early in the morning”.So he gave no quarter to Micheál when it came to setting the private eyes on the consultants. In fact, he congratulated RTÉ on exposing the carry-on of some greedy doctors. “I think Prime Time did the country a service.” Whatever about the legitimate questions raised by Micheál, Leo will know that his taxpaying voters won’t be too put out about any discommoded consultants. As for what his Cabinet or Ministers did or didn’t know about the use of private investigators to get information ahead of a court case on their pay claim taken by consultants, he had this to say: “I don’t know if there was a legal contract with the PIs. The Cabinet agreed that compliance with the contract should be part of the defence but there was no ministerial involvement in the execution of the strategy.”Which led a puzzled Timmy Dooley of Fianna Fáil to shake his head and remark: “It’s a Cabinet without Ministers.”Later on in Leader’s Questions, the subject of Nama came up again. As usual, it was Mick Wallace who introduced it. This time, he wanted to mark the first anniversary of the setting-up of a commission of investigation into the agency’s controversial disposal of its Northern Irish loan portfolio, known as Project Eagle. The Taoiseach said he was pleased to see Nama was going to break even and possibly have a little surplus of €2 billion-€3 billion. “It’s lost about €20 billion and you know it,” retorted Wallace, who claimed Mr Justice John Cooke, who is heading the inquiry, is not getting enough co-operation from Nama.This prompted Leo to muse about the various inquiries going on at the moment and suggest that people shouldn’t jump to conclusions before their work is done.He said certain TDs raised allegations in the Dáil about issues now under consideration by the Disclosures Tribunal and “we now know from what has emerged in Dublin Castle that those allegations made by deputies were false. And I’ve yet to hear those deputies withdraw those allegations and I think they should do so.”As the Ceann Comhairle told him his time was up, the Taoiseach concluded: “I will return to that, incidentally.”Micheál Martin was up like a shot. “On a point of order, is it in order for leaders to comment on a tribunal in the middle of the tribunal’s proceedings?”Micheál needed a ruling, for future reference, “otherwise we will all come in every day and start commenting on various pieces of evidence given at tribunals”.Leo told the Ceann Comhairle he’d be happy with a ruling. “People are constantly commenting on commissions and tribunals.

The process, if successful, would probably only be completed well after he leaves office.There will probably be more high profile meetings and, depending how those go, Kim may make his first trip to the US and be received at the White House.But the challenge of planning the details of the disarmament of North Korea will pass to Mike Pompeo, Mr Trump\u0027s secretary of state.According to diplomats who dealt with North Korea in previous negotiations he can expect the initial euphoria to be followed by years of evasiveness and deception.The US standard for denuclearisation is CVID - which stands for complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean programme.That is also the terminology used by the UN Security Council for more than a decade.It means North Korea destroying anything pertaining to such a programme and having it done under observation by independent inspectors.As one diplomat put it: Any unilateral undertakings by the North Koreans would probably not be worth the paper they\u0027re written on.Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency were kicked out of North Korea in 2002 and they would have to be allowed back in.As well as confirming the destruction of all nuclear facilities the inspectors would have to be satisfied that they could never be restarted.According to Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, there is no difference between the South Korean and US interpretations.However. Mr Moon has also said he recognises it may not happen quickly and he is open to exploring other steps along the way.A tunnel at North Korea\u0026#39s Punggye-ri nuclear test ground being blown upIt was notable that the declaration signed by Kim and Mr Trump referred to working towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.This is the same language Kim had stuck to before the meeting, and indicates his interpretation includes the US presence in South Korea.The US has not stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea since 1992 but North Korea appears to include the 28,000 US troops there as a potential nuclear threat.It says the basis for its nuclear arsenal is to defend itself against the threat of invasion by a US-backed South Korea.China shares North Korea\u0027s view. China is not really demanding or requiring that North Korea dismantle its weapons, but wants to make sure that a nuclear free Korean peninsula is the ultimate goal,” said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre in Beijing.Mr Trump\u0027s decision to end US-South Korean war games in the region would be a step towards what the North Koreans see as denuclearisation of the peninsula.Not yet. As long ago as 1991 North and South Korea signed a joint declaration of the Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. That was the same phrase used this time.Previous efforts fell apart. The question now is whether Kim himself has a different view. Mr Trump believes he does.Trump-Kim summit in pictures: Best photos from Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un\u0026#039s meeting in SingaporeUtopian, really pie in the sky. according to Adam Cathcart, a North Korea expert at Leeds University.Many experts predict that, although the two sides have agreed on the principal of denuclearisation, as they did in 2005, it will never be fully implemented.US President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un walk from their lunch at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island TuesdayAccording to many analysts, North Korea agrees to freeze weapons and missile tests, and ultimately offers to limit its nuclear programme without completely eliminating it in an attempt to get sanctions lifted.Yes. John Bolton, Mr Trump’s new national security adviser, recently said: We expect real denuclearisation, not talks about talks about denuclearisation.If the North Koreans start to stall then any deal could be off.The Brookings Institution published reactions from 13 of the most respected US-based experts on the crisis, and all but one was critical of the underwhelming outcome of the Singapore summit.Please review our commenting policyPetrol prices should be cut to reflect fall in wholesale costs, RAC says\u0026#39Pray for #mprraccoon\u0026#39: Stranded raccoon becomes social media sensation after climbing Minnesota skyscraperNorth Korea savours Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s \u0026#39meeting of the century\u0026#39 as Donald Trump\u0026#39s move to end \u0026#39war games\u0026#39 sparks alarmSingapore summit: How the world reacted to Donald Trump\u0026#39s meeting with Kim Jong-unFather stockpiled weapons and plotted revenge on police and judge who took his child from himDonald Trump hits back at \u0026#39punch-drunk\u0026#39 Robert De NiroSlight raise in blood pressure by 50 could increase dementia risk by 45 per centRaised blood pressure heightens risk of dementia, major UCL study findsNHS will send thousands of patients home sooner to end \u0026#39long stay\u0026#39 culture, chief executive pledgesOne in five British mammal species could be extinct within a decade Majority of Britons support fines for missed GP appointments, survey findsTraces of drugs taken by foreign tourists found in York riversJust one in ten British jihadis have been prosecuted on return to UKComment: Why the translators?

But the virus takes a week or longer to incubate so it\u0027s still possible it\u0027s out there, he said. Countries most closely connected with the Nipah virus outbreakJake Dunning, consultant in infectious diseases at Public Health England, said the agency was monitoring the disease. “This outbreak presents a negligible risk to the UK public. While southern India is a popular destination for UK tourists, the risk of tourists contracting the virus is very low if standard precautions are taken such as avoiding contact with bats and their environments, not touching any sick or dead animals and avoiding raw or partially fermented date sap.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Some 19 people were infected with the virus, which spreads between humans through contact with bodily fluids of affected iniduals. The Indian government has monitored more than 1,000 contacts of those affected and confirmed that the disease has not spread. The disease is spread through the ingestion of fruit bat secretions, such as saliva. Residents in Kerala were told to wash hands thoroughly and not consume fruit or vegetables partly eaten by birds or animals.According to the Press Trust of India two of those who died were siblings in their 20s who had eaten fruit picked near to where they were building a home. The nurse treating them also died.Nipah is on the World Health Organization\u0027s priority list of pathogens with potential to develop into an epidemic and for which there is currently no vaccine or effective treatment.Last month the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations granted a $25m grant to two US-based companies, Profectus BioSciences and Emergent BioSolutions, to develop a vaccine against the disease.Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the coalition, described Nipah as a deadly pathogen that has already travelled thousands of kilometers, has serious epidemic potential and the ability to surprise us.Nipah virus outbreak | Where could it spread?Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1998. It spread to Singapore and more than 100 people were killed in both places. On that occasion, pigs were the virus hosts but they are believed to have caught it from bats.In India the disease was first reported in 2001 and again six years later, with the two outbreaks claiming 50 lives.Both times the disease was reported in areas of the eastern state of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh.Bangladesh has borne the brunt of the disease in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since the first outbreak was reported there in 2001.In Bangladesh in 2004, humans became infected with Nipah after eating date palm sap that had been contaminated by infected fruit bats.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyPetrol prices should be cut to reflect fall in wholesale costs, RAC says\u0026#39Pray for #mprraccoon\u0026#39: Stranded raccoon becomes social media sensation after climbing Minnesota skyscraperNorth Korea savours Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s \u0026#39meeting of the century\u0026#39 as Donald Trump\u0026#39s move to end \u0026#39war games\u0026#39 sparks alarmSingapore summit: How the world reacted to Donald Trump\u0026#39s meeting with Kim Jong-unFather stockpiled weapons and plotted revenge on police and judge who took his child from himDonald Trump hits back at \u0026#39punch-drunk\u0026#39 Robert De NiroWhat next for North Korea-US talks and the steps to denuclearisationSlight raise in blood pressure by 50 could increase dementia risk by 45 per centRaised blood pressure heightens risk of dementia, major UCL study findsNHS will send thousands of patients home sooner to end \u0026#39long stay\u0026#39 culture, chief executive pledges Majority of Britons support fines for missed GP appointments, survey findsTraces of drugs taken by foreign tourists found in York riversOne in five British mammal species could be extinct within a decadeJust one in ten British jihadis have been prosecuted on return to UKComment: Why the translators?

Two photographers, who deny taking the pictures, were fined £8,500 each. The royal couple had asked for £1.4 million in compensation, but after the award by a court in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, Kensington Palace said they considered the case closed.Closer’s legal team are expected to produce in court footage of Meghan Markle removing items of clothing before seductively posing in shorts in a video called Grilling Never Looked So Hot, to make the case that female members of the Royal family have willingly posed for revealing images.French magazine Closer will argue that the advert shows members of the Royal family are \u0026#39happy with sexy photos\u0026#39The footage was shot for Men’s Health magazine in 2013, during her career as an actress before she became the Duchess of Sussex.Other photographs allegedly showing her topless on a beach may also be produced. The images, also taken before she joined the Royal family, are widely available online. Kensington Palace sources say they were tampered with and may have been taken without her knowledge. The Palace declined to comment on the current proceedings.Sources close to the case said younger members of the Royal family were increasingly behaving like celebrities, and suggested they were leaving themselves open to the same sort of media attention experienced by film and sports stars.“They’re happy with sexy photos when they’re in control but then demand huge amounts in compensation when the pictures are unauthorised,” said a legal source. “This is unwarranted and frankly hypocritical.”The damages for the topless photographs of the Duchess were awarded in September after five years of legal proceedings. The photographs were taken at a Provence chateau owned by the Earl of Snowdon.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyPetrol prices should be cut to reflect fall in wholesale costs, RAC says\u0026#39Pray for #mprraccoon\u0026#39: Stranded raccoon becomes social media sensation after climbing Minnesota skyscraperNorth Korea savours Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s \u0026#39meeting of the century\u0026#39 as Donald Trump\u0026#39s move to end \u0026#39war games\u0026#39 sparks alarmSingapore summit: How the world reacted to Donald Trump\u0026#39s meeting with Kim Jong-unFather stockpiled weapons and plotted revenge on police and judge who took his child from himDonald Trump hits back at \u0026#39punch-drunk\u0026#39 Robert De NiroWhat next for North Korea-US talks and the steps to denuclearisationRaised blood pressure heightens risk of dementia, major UCL study findsSlight raise in blood pressure by 50 could increase dementia risk by 45 per centNHS will send thousands of patients home sooner to end \u0026#39long stay\u0026#39 culture, chief executive pledgesOne in five British mammal species could be extinct within a decade Majority of Britons support fines for missed GP appointments, survey findsTraces of drugs taken by foreign tourists found in York riversJust one in ten British jihadis have been prosecuted on return to UKComment: Why the translators?

But he also acknowledged cash-flow issues that have raised eyebrows on Wall Street.“Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us”, Mr Musk wrote. “What drives us is our\u0026nbspmission to accelerate the world transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable”.Elon Musk says Tesla will enable ‘full self-driving features’ in AugusTesla autopilot was on and driver’s hands were off wheel before crashTesla crashes into parked police car in Autopilot modeInvestors have raised questions about Tesla’s high rate of cash burn and its ability to hit production targets as it seeks to roll out its mass-market Model 3.

Instead tax-free childcare favours families who can afford to save, and 30 hours is open to parents on very high incomes, while availability to families on lower incomes is limited.”UK news in picturesEngland manager Gareth Southgate, his players and coaching staff pose for the official England squad photo ahead of traveling to the World Cup in Russia.Play was suspended during the match between Lancashire and Essex as an Air Ambulance landed on the pitch after one of the spectators was taken ill on day three of the Specsavers County Championship, Division One match at Emirates Old Trafford, Manchester.Marchers hold up banners as they gather to mark 100 years since women won the right to vote in the UKThe parade makes its way up The Mall from Horse Guards Parade to Buckingham Palace, central London, following the Trooping the Colour ceremony, as the Queen celebrates her official birthday.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Andy Martin on the man who’ll be guiding ITV viewers through a month of World Cup hyperboleEverybody is a commentator these days. @Chasepacheco1, for example, who tweeted after last month’s Uefa Champions League final:\u0026nbsp“My Liverpool team fought hard and I’m proud of them. Except for Karius, he can die in a hole.” Loris Karius, Liverpool’s German goalkeeeper, let in three goals (one of them, to be fair, a moment of sheer brilliance by Gareth Bale). Which means that online he finds himself denounced as a “Nazi”. And, according to one theory, paid handsomely for his “howlers” by Real Madrid. We can assume that the World Cup in Russia this month will be the occasion of a deluge of similar wildly overheated rhetoric, hyperbole and death threats.But you won’t be hearing any of it from ITV’s chief football commentator Clive Tyldesley. Winner many times over of the Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year award, he is the voice of moderation, the calm centre at the eye of the storm. Occasionally the target of Twitter rage himself, he expects to encounter not just a lot of verbals but also racism, hooliganism, and misogyny on top. Football, he says, is “warts and all. It reflects life. It corrupts. That is part of its fascination.” But, from the heights of the commentary box, he tries to provide something like a counterpoint to all the frenzy, the agony and the ecstasy.He is a fit-looking 63 and described himself as “a respecter of vocabulary” when I went to see him shortly before the Champions League final. “I would never say it’s a ‘disaster’ or a ‘tragedy’ if the ball goes through the goalkeeper’s legs,” he said. “You only use words like that if somebody dies.” He thought he might stretch to “calamity”.\u0026nbspHis words were strangely prophetic. As it turned out that is exactly the word he selected to describe Liverpool’s “goalkeeping calamity” when Karius bowled the ball right onto the toe of Benzema. But it struck me that there was also a kind of poetry, of a restrained, austere kind, in his summary of Real Madrid’s first goal, perhaps something like an instant haiku:And Real Madrid are in front.His “an evening that had started so promisingly for Liverpool” sounded a poignantly elegiac note. I also had to admire the comment, after Karius lets a tame one by Bale slip through his hands and into the net: “His reputation would do well to survive that moment.” Note the use of the conditional tense. Tyldesley appreciates that the keeper’s reputation is already in tatters, but that – perhaps in an ideal world – it could still recover.David Hume said that you cannot get an “ought” from an “is”. Somehow Clive Tyldesley manages to pull that off. He is only describing a game of football but there is an implicit ethics in his commentary. Tyldesley agrees with Bill Shankly that football is not a matter of life and death, but omits the punchline, “it’s more important than that.” Still, it is “a huge emotional investment by all the people who turn on. They choose to watch.” Therefore, as a commentator, “You have to be careful with your use of words.”The Playstation Schools Cup U15 final, between Thomas Telford School and Carshalton Boys Sports College, held at Reading’s Madejski stadium, was as fraught and intense as any Champions League final. Some of the players even had agents already. “Maybe overdid it a bit, Hodnett,” commented Tyldesley, in his simultaneous schools broadcast, as he skyed the ball over the bar. He prepared for this game as scrupulously as he is now preparing for the opening game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and had a foolscap file in front of him containing assorted facts about the players.There was a goalmouth melee, which saw both the Carshalton goalkeeper and the Telford player red-carded. And a penalty shootout after the much fancied Telford came back from 2-0 down only to blow it on the last kick of the game. “Now that is absolutely out of order,” said Tyldesley, as the hulking No 10 wrapped a menacing paw around the referee. “He’d have done well to keep his opinions to himself.” It’s advice he has tried to follow.But in a sense all of his commentary implies an opinion. Presumably he would have disapproved of Zinedine Zidane’s farewell headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and David Beckham’s retaliation on Diego Simeone that got him sent off in 1998. Tyldesley himself doesn’t get flustered. He is unflappable. He has – and admires – grace under pressure. “His control wasn’t the best,” as he said in one of his critical remarks about the U15 final. The ability to take and keep control is all important, whether you’re on the pitch or off it.This might have something to do with having been subjected to the furious “hairdryer” treatment from Sir Alex Ferguson when still manager of Manchester United, not just once but twice. “You really can feel your hair blowing backwards.” He thought that the boot that hit David Beckham in the face in the dressing room was “probably an accident”.Whether it’s broadcasting to schools or to 10 million people on ITV, Tyldesley always feels a sense of “responsibility”. “Balance” is a key word. He points out that the dying words of Pheidippedes, the messenger who ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to report on the outcome of the battle back in 490BC, “We won!”, only caused confusion, because people were bound to ask, “Who is ‘we’?” “He wasn’t a good journalist,” says Tyldesley. “What he should have said is ‘Athens won’.” Greece 1, Persia 0.He was once commentating on an England-Scotland game with Ron Atkinson when Atkinson insisted on saying “we”. Tyldesley said to him, “You should say ‘England’ not ‘we’.” Although he accepts that there perhaps he was being “correct beyond reason”. He allows that the occasional we “might slip out” at the World Cup. “I’m English but I’m still objective. You don’t choose to support England. It would be odd to switch to supporting Chile.”Tyldesley disapproves of those who get too fancy. “A straightforward pass would have done,” is a classic line of his, which happened to be addressed to schools. So too when it comes to commentary. He argues that cricket and golf have passages of inaction which permit – or even demand – “colour”, the kind of lyrical and expansive discourse, infinitely digressive, forever associated with John Arlott and Brian Johnston in cricket or Peter Alliss in golf. Steve Bunce likewise in boxing, and I can get similarly carried away when it comes to describing surfing, perhaps because there are often long lulls between the epic and the awesome.Tyldesley is more a fan of plain speaking. He says the best ad slogan of all time is Ronseal’s “Does exactly what it says on the tin”. That’s how he thinks commentary should be. You observe, you analyse, you try not to hype it up. You keep it “succinct”. “There’s no point trying to be Wordsworth or Browning. As Barry Davis once said, “One man’s commentator is another man’s pain in the arse.”Everything is mediated and mediatised. There are no exceptions. The old Zen koan, “If a tree fell over in the forest and no one was there to witness it would you still hear it?” now has a clear answer. Yes, because it would be captured by a passing drone or on satellite TV, blazed all over Instagram, tweeted about furiously, the tree’s friends on Facebook would start a crowdfunding campaign, and it would shortly thereafter be the subject of a controversial Channel 4 documentary. Nothing happens any more without commentary. But this is and always has been especially true of football. “They think it’s all over… it is now”, Kenneth Wolstenholme’s line, is as memorable as the 1966 World Cup final itself. Whether or not the ball crossed the line is less significant now than the fact that there was so much debate about whether or not it had. And new technology is not making the debate go away, rather the opposite.I can’t play football without also hearing something like this in my head:\u0026nbsp “Martin comes on, scores with his first touch, and the crowd goes wild.” As Simon Critchley, philosopher and (currently distraught) Liverpool fan comments in his book, What We Think About When We Think About Football, “We usually know football through commentary, through largely, and hugely, inane commentary.”Tyldesley doesn’t think of it as inane. “Sometimes,” he says, “‘a game of two halves’ is exactly what it is. You can’t improve on it.” If he were to write a book about it, it would be something like the opposite of Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch. Hornby is all about irrational fandom, ritual, intensity of feeling. Tyldesley is more of a phlegmatic “keep calm and carry on” sort of guy. “We don’t need to see that!” he exclaimed at the sight of an overflow of emotions on the sidelines with even teachers getting hot under the collar.Albert Camus said, “I learned everything I know about morality from football.” Which is to say, when it comes to the “beautiful game”, the good, the bad, and the ugly are all on display. There are undoubtedly heroes and villains in Tyldesley’s narrative. But he does it subtly. “You try not to sound too much like a Methodist preacher,” as he puts it. When it comes to making criticism of the play – you could call it a judo throw – by Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain, that resulted in Mo Salah going off in agony with a dislocated shoulder, Tyldesley is judicious but still uncompromising in his remarks. There is “a coming together with Ramos that only he can fully explain”. As he goes up to collect the cup, Ramos is described as “not everyone’s idea of a model professional – maybe nobody’s”.There is even an implicit politics in his commentary. Tyldesley has no objection to big money in football. “It’s labour intensive, they’re entitled to be paid. You can’t do without inidual players.” But still “the collective should be stronger than the inidual”. And this is where we went so badly wrong in the Brexit campaign, and the adjacent media coverage, he argues. “We turned it into a personality competition. Instead of providing the relevant information, we focused on the impact it would have on the lives of politicians.”He says that “the most popular team in this country is not Manchester United or Liverpool, it’s England. It’s a great democracy.” And he has to be “inclusive”. He would never use the word “esoteric” for example, he says, because he doesn’t “want anyone to have to get up and look for a dictionary”.When I saw him, Tyldesley was prepping Arabic and Russian names. He says, “I will try to get it correct, but I will not make sounds we don’t make in the English language.” When identifying James Rodriguez of Chile in the past, he wanted to say “James”.\u0026nbspEventually he bowed to pressure from Twitter to say “Ham-es”, in the Spanish manner. “But later I learned that his father,\u0026nbspa 007 fan,\u0026nbsphad named him after James Bond.”\u0026nbspHe felt vindicated, because in Spanish-speaking countries it’s always James, never Ham-es, Bond.\u0026nbspHe is not, he reckons, “responsible for the teaching of Spanish” or Arabic or Russian.In an extremist, Dionysian world, Tyldesley is an Apollonian voice of reason. He holds the mirror up to football with minimum distortion, minimum fuss. Sound without the fury. A degree zero of poetry. Let’s hope he doesn’t have to repeat a line he first used of England versus Iceland in 2016, “This is the most abject failure that I can recall.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra.

A Tennessee woman is suing Nasa for the right to keep a vial of moon dust which she received from astronaut Neil Armstrong. Laura Murray Cicco of Manchester, Tennessee, has alleged in a 6 June lawsuit in the US District Court in Kansas that there is no law forbidding people from owning such material. Nasa had said in 2011 court documents that “private citizens cannot own lunar material” after a raid of a woman called Joann Davis in California, who was the widow of an engineer on Apollo 11 spacecraft which famously took Mr Armstrong to the moon. Ms Davis had been attempting to sell a gift given to her by her husband - a paperweight containing lunar material. It was seized by the federal space agency. Ms Cicco’s vial, approximately the size of lipstick, has a note attached that reads: “To Laura Ann Murray – Best of luck – Neal Armstrong Apollo 11”. She said she received the vial when she was 10 years old and that the note is written on the back of her father’s old business card. Ms Cicco claimed that her father was friends with Mr Armstrong when the astronaut was teaching at the University of Cincinnati, near where her family had lived at the time. Nasa announces organic matter has been found on MarsThe lawsuit also stated that Ms Cicco had Mr Armstrong’s signature “verified” and that an expert, Tom Tague of the Bruker Corporation, said the gray, powdery material in the vial may have originated from lunar regolith”. According to its website, Bruker is a “manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research, as well as for industrial and applied analysis”.“Lunar material is not contraband...She is the rightful and legal owner,” the lawsuit, an apparent challenged to the 2011 ruling, stated. Ms Davis also sued Nasa and claimed it was an unlawful search and seizure. She had eventually settled out of court for $100,000. In all there has been approximately 842 pounds (382 kg) of moon rocks collected and brought back to Earth by astronauts. Nasa has gifted plaques to famous people in past that have contained slivers of moon rocks, some of which made it into the private collection market. Nasa finds flowing water on Mars - in picturesIn 1998, a Florida man was arrested for attempting to sell a lunar rock roughly the size of a fingernail and weighing less than a gram for the astonishing price of $5m. The rock had originally been given to the Honduran government by then-President Richard Nixon. The man had allegedly obtained the precious material from a retired Honduran military officer. He was caught when explaining the story to undercover customs agents after they had placed an advertisement in USA Today calling for moon rocks - in a bid known as Operation Lunar Eclipse. In 1993, the magazine Omni had reported that moon dust was available on the private market in part because of dirty space suits. Nasa had reportedly sent the suits to the manufacturer after the mission “for inspection”.

Macedonia is a candidate state for EU membership.Under the deal\u0026nbspthe country’s name would be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, to reflect the existence of the Greek region of Macedonia on the other side of the border and the cultural claim Greeks see over it. The name would be used both internally by the government and externally when conducting foreign affairs.The accord was finalised\u0026nbspduring a phone call between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev on Tuesday, and in return for the name change Greece would lift its vetoes on the country joining the EU and Nato.Both countries’ parliaments need to ratify the deal, and Macedonia is expected to hold a referendum on the issue. Nationalists in both countries are opposed to compromise and could yet derail the accord. The agreement is set to be formally signed on Saturday at Lake Prespa, which straddles the country’s border, and that of neighbouring Albania.There is no way back.“The name change will be implemented not only in the country\u0027s international relations but also domestically,” Mr Tsipras said in a televised press conference, while Mr Zaev, speaking separately, told his countrymen: “There is no way back.” The PM called on the opposition to back the name change and said it would guarantee access to the EU and Nato.In Greece, the right wing Independent Greeks party, which is in Mr Tsipras\u0027s governing coalition partner, has said it would oppose the agreement in a parliamentary vote – meaning the left wing prime minister will need to seek support from political opponents.Negotiations, which have been on and off for decades, have intensified in recent months under the oversight of EU, US, and German diplomats.Ancient Macedonia was the cradle of warrior king Alexander’s empire, but under the Romans the province of Macedonia was expanded to include territory ning Macedonia, as well as Bulgaria and Albania.Some Greeks have accused Macedonians, who speak a Slavic language, of appropriating aspects of Greek culture. An eight-storey high statue resembling Alexander in the Macedonian capital of Skopje caused a fuss in 2011. Macedonian authorities insist that the statue is of a “warrior on a horse” rather than the ancient Greek hero.As a goodwill gesture preceding the deal, in February of this year the Macedonian government renamed Skopje\u0027s airport, which was previously known as\u0026nbspSkopje Alexander the Great Airport, to Skopje International Airport.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during their historic meeting at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore.US President Donald Trump looking at a cake being brought for him during a working lunch with Singapore\u0027s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his visit to The Istana, the official residence of the prime minister, in Singapore.

Thats how serious I was about getting that job.Kazi then found business success after launching perfume company Sunnamusk, but for the past two and a half years, hes been focused on his real dream: starting an airline.Breaking into the airline business is a monumental challenge for anyone, but Kazi has no industry experience at all - and hes dead set on keeping to his religious morals.Malaysian carrier Rayani Air is an example of a Sharia airline - although it was shut down in 2016Kazis chief adviser, veteran aviation consultant John Brayford, has been concerned about the feasibility of Kazis Sharia business plan from the start.If you look at the airlines around the world that dont serve alcohol, theres not one of them which can be considered successful, John says.But Kazi was always reluctant to budge on his principles, even when he attracted a barrage of hateful online comments from Islamophobic trolls who made jibes about kamikaze pilots and making stopovers in Islamic State territory.However, he has recently decided that his controversial Sharia angle has turned into a PR headache - so hes started to tone it down a bit while courting passengers and investors.The entrepreneur told Sun Online: When you say Sharia compliance, people will take it as Sharia enforcement, which isnt the case.But were trying to position ourselves to Islamic investors. Theres obviously the halal food and then modest dressing - I dont believe in exploiting women to get more business.There will be no alcohol but we will try to use substitutes.The under-experienced and overenthusiastic businessman dreams of flying long-haul to the Middle East, but first he needs to establish some short-haul routes to make a name for his airline and earn some money.In the documentary, we follow Kazi as he opens negotiations to fly out of Londons Ashford Airport and Waterford Airport in Ireland.Normally, airlines pay airports a fee in return for being allowed to fly from them, but wheeler-dealer Kazi was audacious enough to demand that the airports should be paying Firnas.With this unorthodox request, Kazi gets a firm no and negotiations collapse, forcing his ego to make an emergency landing.But it turns out that Kazi, banking on his negotiations going well, had already signed a £60,000-a-month lease on a 72-seater turboprop plane, egged on by business partner and fellow Bangladeshi Abdul Roqueb.He may be used to cleaning toilets, but Kazi had never been in it that deep before.The would-be airline boss was paying thousands for his plane to sit on the tarmac, with nowhere to fly it and his credibility in tatters.Still haemorrhaging money, Kazi cancelled the lease on his pricey 72-seater and returned to the drawing board, where he decided that flying short commuter hops are his only hope if he wants to break into the notoriously change-averse airline business.With nothing to show for two years work, it was time to go plane shopping again - but this time Kazi had to dial down his enthusiasm, and act a bit less like a kid in a sweet shop.On the show, we see him poking around a much smaller 19-seater Jetstream plane - a sturdy little craft but a world away from the long-haul Dreamliner Kazi wants to see in Firnas colours.Hes clearly underwhelmed by the tired-looking upholstery and creaking seats, and he knows that his hopes of flying to the Middle East couldnt be further away.That hole there, says Kazi to the planes pilot and owner, as he inspects the wing. Is that meant to be there?Raging at his team, Kazi adds: This is not the plan. Every decision we make we have to go right back to the bottom. Its going on and on and costing me money every day.But he has no choice. If he wants to start an airline, he has to start small - and in this business, the Jetstream, at a cost of £8,500 a month, is as small as it gets.Today, it finally looks as if Firnas first aircraft is ready to fly - and Kazis journey from plane cleaner to plane owner is complete.Kazi has raised around £500,000, money which will be used to lease planes and cover the many costs of getting set up.His nifty little Jetstream plane has been painted in a fetching shade of Firnas purple, and is ready to be sent on short commuter runs between UK cities.And despite the online backlash, Kazi is still committed to filling the gap in the market for an Islamic airline.Its about brand positioning - its about being different and sticking out from the crowd, a chirpy Kazi tells us.We want to be a premium airline. Not your low-cost Easyjet or Ryanair.Firnas is now just months away from operating its first commercial charter flights, as soon as all the regulatory hurdles have been cleared.From then, Kazi estimates, long-haul flights should be just two or three years down the line.What were doing will be a game changer, he insists.It may well be, but dont hold your breath for that celebratory glass of bubbly when Firnas Airways finally does take off - you wont be allowed to drink it anyway.How To Start an Airline airs at 10.30pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is likely to be met with some opposition to stave off a constitutional crisis.They are prepared to force a no-confidence vote in the PM which would lead to a leadership contest once the legislation is secured.Tory MPs are furious at her handling of the Brexit talks and fear the UK will be stuck with EU customs rules at the next election.But they would only act once the EU Withdrawal Bill becomes law, which is likely to be in the coming weeks.One said: “The short-term focus is getting Royal Assent for the Bill before we break for summer.The other flashpoint could be over Ministers being required to show Parliament by the autumn that it has tried to negotiate a Customs Union.If we steer it on to the statute book I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a vote of no confidence in the PM, something I’d have said ‘no chance’ to a month ago.”Another said Mrs May had frustrated Tories over the backstop option that would kick in if a new customs arrangement was not in place by the end of 2020.Brexit Secretary David Davis threatened to quit if the December 2021 end date was not in the offer to Brussels.The senior Tory MP said: “In the past people thought she would see Brexit through. That’s why people stuck by her after the General Election. Now she is wobbling.”It would have meant less than an hour’s debate for each amendment.

She should confirm this week what she wants from Brussels — no ifs, no buts and no more compromises.If EU bosses think we’re not ready to go it alone, they’ll offer us the thinnest gruel — and we’ll have to take it. They’re already warning that if we want a trade agreement we’ll have to accept free movement.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.There’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

Heres what we know so far...The government is understood to have accepted the first two parts of rebel MP Dominic Grieves amendment - which would hand Parliament much more control over the Brexit negotiations.Ministers are conceding that within seven days of Mrs May agreeing a Brexit deal, it must be voted on in the Commons, and that if there if there is no deal by November 30, the Government needs approval from MPs on how to proceed.This would effectively remove no-deal as a realistic option, with Parliament effectively in charge of negotiations.The government effectively voted in favour of taking out a Lords amendment that would have removed the power of ministers to decide when retained EU law can be challenged in court.Two Tory MPs - Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - voted against the government.Todays debate marks the start of the governments attempts to undo the majority of changes put forward by the House of Lords regarding the EU Withdrawal Bill.Dominic Grieve has said Parliament would have structured input into what happened next to avoid a crisis.But is not believed that the government are willing to agree to Mr Grieves call for MPs to take control of negotiations as a last resort.More crunch votes are expected on the customs union tomorrow.BBCs Laura Kuenssberg urged caution on interpreting the meaningful vote outcome, tweeting: govt source says only agreement is to keep talking, no actual concessions have been agreed, this might be done for tonight, but it is not over.Dr Phillip Lee, who earlier resigned as Justice Minister over the vote, has tweeted his delight that the government had agreed to introduce an amendment to the bill which will give Parliament the voice I always wanted it to have in the Brexit process.If she makes the changes the rebels are demanding, Theresa Mays negotiating hand in Brussels will be weaker because the EU will know we cannot threaten to walk away from their negotiations and go it alone as MPs are likely to reject it in a vote.What we know so far:The second big vote comes tomorrow (Wednesday), when MPs decide on an amendment requiring the government to report on its progress in negotiating membership of a customs union with the EU.May has a working majority of just 13, including the Democratic Unionist party, meaning in theory, just seven Tory MPs need to switch sides to cause a defeat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want to build a humane but fair and strict migration and borders policy.”The announcement came a day after Spain agreed to take in a migrant rescue ship that had been turned away by Italy.Spain’s new socialist government opened its ports to the Aquarius, which had more than 600 mainly African asylum seekers on board including unaccompanied minors.Rome’s eurosceptic interior minister Matteo Salvini declared a “victory” and crowed: “We have opened a new front of debate for a new immigration policy at a continental level.”He is also due to meet his German counterpart, Horst Seehofer, in Berlin in the near future for talks that are likely to steer the EU towards a much tougher line on migration.German officials said Mr Seehofer was “fully in tune” with Mr Salvini, who vowed during his election campaign to deport 500,000 illegal immigrants from Italy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has taken this decision on his own and without consulting the local party beforehand.“It should be noted that the Bracknell constituency voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.”It’s understood Dr Lee — who has a personal interest in space issues — was particularly upset over the EU trying to oust the UK from the Galileo programme.It also emerged that Dr Lee had even failed to tell his own boss, Justice Secretary David Gauke, that he was going.The stunned PM only received his resignation letter just as she was going into a Cabinet meeting this morning.The PM’s official spokesman gave a curt response to Mr Lee’s resignation, saying only: “His resignation is a matter for him and we thank him for his service.”Last night the Daily  claimed three ministers had discussed joining an anti-Brexit campaign calling for a second EU referendum.A source said the Best for Britain campaign has held a series of talks with Remain-backing ministers about opposing Theresa May over Brexit.The move would be a direct challenge to the PM’s authority as she has firmly rejected any suggestion of a second vote on Brexit.Best for Britain is funded by billionaire George Soros and says it is “working tirelessly” to overturn Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boldness in animals is often associated with leadership which can result in getting more food but also means they become a more likely target for predators.Bristol University researchers said the results show sociability skews bold fish towards conformity.Dr Christos Ioannou added: “The study shows that risk- taking when alone may not predict riskiness when in a group for the more social individuals.“Instead they are more likely to conform to what others are doing.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was going to find another job and some of the other lads were really struggling and uncomfortable in jeans. We gathered it was a health and safety issue.“But we realised that as there were women working in offices on the same site in skirts, they couldn’t stop us doing the same.”The lads were also inspired by The Sun’s tale of boys at a school in Sonning Common, Oxfordshire, who beat a shorts ban by wearing skirts — citing the head’s gender-neutral uniform policy.Simon went on: “I dashed home and the wife thought I was a lunatic when I started rummaging through her gear.“A bloke even wolf-whistled me. I’ve never had one of those before — well, not from a man.”Simon, who later switched to a bright green slinky dress, added: “There is of course a serious side.“On building sites a skirt could easily get caught on something.“Yet I’ve never had any problems in my shorts, other than a few grazes. I don’t mind regulations be­ing imposed, as long as they’re properly considered.”Bodybuilder Adam Houdoire, 29, spent £10 at a supermarket on an above-the-knee leopard-print dress.

The Tory Remainer delivered a rousing speech warning her parliamentary colleagues that it was time to stand up and be true to what they believe in. Ms Soubry, who has led campaigns to stay in the EU, spoke to those MPs who have approached her in quiet and dark corridors to praise her and other Tory Brexit rebels. The Conservative former minister also called out businesses who express concerns about leaving the EU in private but won\u0027t speak in public.  And she warned about the dangerous turn the debate over Brexit has taken speaking about death threats she has received and the fears of a colleague who had to attend a public engagement with six armed under cover police officers.  She said: I am getting a little tired of honorable members and right honorable members on the backbenches, in government, even in the cabinet who come up to me and others in quiet and dark corridors to British businesses who demand private meetings where they lay bare their despair but refuse to go public, to the commentators who say to me \u0027you\u0027re doing a great job keep on going\u0027 in the face of death threats which mean that one of our number had to attend a public engagement with six armed under cover police officers.

The amendment to her flagship EU Withdrawal Bill would have let MPs block us from leaving the EU without a deal. But MPs voted down the plan tonight after a furious campaign by the government. Theresa May only managed to win the vote after issuing a last-minute compromise to buy off rebellious Tories. So who did actually vote for a meaningful vote on Brexit in the end? And how many Tories rebelled? Search for your local MP below.  Tonight\u0027s vote is one of 15 on the EU Withdrawal Bill. It killed off plans to give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. The plan would have given Parliament a specific power to decide what happens next MPs reject her agreement with Brussels. MPs could have forced her back to the negotiating table, for example, instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insisted they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers feared would happen. So Solicitor General Robert Buckland bought off Tory rebels by promising to meet them - and dropping a huge hint he\u0027d accept their pleas. Mr Buckland said he was particularly interested in a compromise that was put forward by Remain-backing Tory MP Mr Grieve. Under the compromise, Theresa May will still be forced to let MPs vote on her final Brexit deal this autumn. Then, however, there\u0027s a new step. If talks are still deadlocked after 30 November, she will have to draw up a new plan of what to do next - and ask MPs to approve it.  This compromise was enough to buy off Tory rebels even though it gives MPs less power than hoped to block a no-deal Brexit. That\u0027s because Theresa May, not MPs, will still be drawing up the plan to be voted on. This plan was enough to buy off Tory rebels even though it wouldn\u0027t let MPs block a no-deal Brexit, as the original plan would have. Search for how your MP voted here   How did Tory MPs vote? Tory MPs voted AGAINST a meaningful vote. But 2 rebelled against the party line to back it. Tory rebels Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry voted to give parliament a meaningful vote. How did Labour MPs vote? Labour MPs voted FOR a meaningful vote. But 5 rebelled against the party line. Ronnie Campbell, Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann, Graham Stringer plus suspended Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent, voted against giving Parliament a meaningful vote. What if my MP did not vote? There were 12 MPs from the main parties who did not vote, six from the Labour benches, five Tories and one Lib Dems. For those MPs who \u0027did not vote\u0027, some abstain deliberately - but not all. Sometimes illness or personal reasons can be blamed for them not turning up. MPs have to turn up to the House of Commons in person to vote. So if they can\u0027t, often they \u0027pair\u0027 off with an MP in another party who agrees not to vote too. This, however, doesn\u0027t show up in the system. All these reasons mean it\u0027s not always well-advised to harangue your MP for not voting on a particular day. There could be a very good reason. MPs are holding a marathon two-day voting session on June 12-13 on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - the law that enacts Brexit. Theresa May wants MPs to overturn 15 amendments, passed by the House of Lords, that would push Britain towards a much softer Brexit. It could make or break her premiership so she\u0027s been pleading for Tory Remain-backers not to vote against the government. But it\u0027s going to be massively confusing. To help you follow the drama, here\u0027s a summary of the original 15 Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - and what they would achieve if they pass.  Meaningful vote*: Would give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in Autumn 2018 on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal. This would give Parliament a specific power to decide what happens next if her deal is rejected. MPs could force her back to the negotiating table, for example, instead of crashing out with no deal. Backers insist they wouldn\u0027t use it to \u0027stop Brexit\u0027 - but that\u0027s exactly what Leavers fear will happen. (49, 19) Customs Union: Would force Tory ministers to take steps towards staying in an EU Customs Union - by making a statement on how they\u0027d do it. This could stop Britain from striking trade deals around the world - but would prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland and keep free trade with the EU. (1, 1) Single market: Would force the Tory government to keep Britain in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which practically means keeping membership of the single market, and following nearly all its rules. This would likely continue free movement between Britain and the EU - almost as we see it today. (110A, 51) Brexit Day: Would remove the legal date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - to let ministers change the date at the last minute if they don\u0027t have a deal. Leavers also fear this could be a tool to delay Brexit indefinitely. (95, 37) Northern Ireland*: Would give added protection to the Northern Ireland border - forcing ministers to obey the Good Friday Agreement, and keep the province in an EU customs union if it stops a hard border. (88, 25) Henry VIII powers 1: Would block Tory ministers from changing EU laws on several issues - employment, equality, health and safety, environmental or consumer rights - without enhanced scrutiny by MPs. (11, 4) Henry VIII powers 2: Would block ministers having a wide-ranging power to decide when EU laws can be challenged after Brexit. (18, 52) Henry VIII powers 3: Limits ministers\u0027 power to change law without a vote - they\u0027d only be able to do it if necessary, instead of if appropriate. (31, 10) Henry VIII powers 4: Would give a \u0027sifting committee\u0027 of MPs the power to insist Parliament gets a vote on legal changes. (70, 110) Refugees\u0027 rights*: Would continue refugees\u0027 rights to be reunited with their families in the UK under the EU\u0027s Dublin Regulation. (59, 24) Citizens\u0027 EU legal rights*: People could continue suing the government in UK courts for breaching general principles of EU law. (19, 53) Charter of Fundamental Rights: Would ensure the vast majority of the EU\u0027s Charter stays in UK law. (15, 5) Theresa May\u0027s mandate: Would force the PM to get MPs\u0027 approval for her \u0027mandate\u0027 for Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. (51, 20) Future EU laws: Would let ministers copy and paste new EU laws into UK law after Brexit, and carry on taking part in EU agencies. (93, 32) Protecting the environment: Would block ministers from using Brexit to water down any protections for the environment. (1, 3)  For geeks, each amendment\u0027s \u0027number\u0027 is in brackets. As if it wasn\u0027t confusing enough, each one gets \u0027renumbered\u0027 so we\u0027ve included both numbers - the old number, followed by the new number. Some of the above will be overturned, some could pass if there\u0027s a Tory rebellion. Four we\u0027ve marked with asterixes (*) - these are ones where the government has offered a compromise to get them through."},{"url":null,"title":"mps laugh idea eu dont","story":"NewsMPs explode with laughter at idea the EU don\u0027t know the Tory cabinet is divided over BrexitVeteran Tory Ken Clarke said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest that voting to give parliament a meaningful vote undermined the Prime Minister\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent15:25, 12 JUN 2018Updated15:27, 12 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs exploded with laughter as veteran Europhile Tory Ken Clarke mocked the idea the EU don\u0027t know the cabinet is divided.  He was speaking to urge the Commons to vote for an amendment on the EU Withdrawal bill which would give give MPs a so-called meaningful vote on the final deal.  Mr Clarke dismissed the idea that this would undermine Theresa May\u0027s position. He told MPs: The argument that we\u0027re undermining the Prime Minister\u0027s position in the negotiations is equally ridiculous. It is based on the proposition that out there on the continent they don\u0027t know there are divisions in the cabinet and they don\u0027t know what the situation is here in the House of Commons.  And were a whisper to get out with some slightly unusual votes in the House of Commons this would undermine my right honourable friend\u0027s position [David Davis] and that of the Prime Minister and make it much weaker for them. The Commons erupted into laughter at the MP for Rushcliffe\u0027s intervention. And he continued by suggesting that the continent is utterly bewildered by the Anglo Saxons, they have no idea what we think we\u0027re doing. And he hit out at the real zealots in this house who he accused of trying to stop this parliament playing any part in the process which is totally unacceptable. One of the Lords amendments that MPs will be voting on this afternoon is one which gives Parliament extensive powers to direct ministers how to proceed in the event of no deal or if a deal with Brussels is rejected by MPs.   The government opposes the amendment and Brexit Secretary David Davis earlier dismissed it as a no Brexit amendment - quoting comments made by Crossbench peer Lord Bilimoria in the House of Lords.  But the Government fears losing a vote on the amendment. Attempting to avoid losing the vote, which would prove humiliating, ministers have tabled a compromise amendment which would see a minister come to the House within 28 days of a deal being rejected to tell MPs what will happen next.  But the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve has moved an amendment insisting on a binding Commons motion.

But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of 909 followers - including women and babies. The 1978 mass suicide was the largest ever single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act, and remained so until the 9/11 terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryan\u0027s death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrifying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, \u0027We\u0027re going to meet Mr. Fraser\u0027. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and \u0027you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown\u0027. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the hell is going on, is there something else we can do?\u0027 Then my father went into a rhetoric: \u0027This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser.\u0027 Terrified about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the town\u0027s pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail  Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide  had been mixed by 30-year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring.  The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infant\u0027s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and it\u0027s been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some children\u0027s mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a 45 minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I don\u0027t care how many screams you hear, I don\u0027t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you\u0027d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the 1970s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, California, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial divides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the People\u0027s Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didn\u0027t understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we don\u0027t understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway? We didn\u0027t think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones\u0027 hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldn\u0027t get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. \u0027You have to die for it\u0027 means we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing 1,000 - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful life as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in 1978 that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have functioned as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terrified he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November 14, Jones\u0027 health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon his return to the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November 18 the departing Ryan party - along with 30 defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than 20 times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was \u0027my God!\u0027 I heard my mom holler \u0027look at Patty\u0027, my wife. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerry\u0027s son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryan\u0027s death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDF (Guyana Defense Force) will be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, 79, who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at 400. Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones\u0027 body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cult\u0027s headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Several students were reduced to tears in an advanced cognitive and biological psychology exam on Wednesday, May 30 after the topic they were told to revise didn\u0027t come up in the paper. Split in to two halves, the first half of the exam had four potential topics but only three questions. Meaning one of the topics would not appear.   A student, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted Somerset Live about the exam and explained that they had been told to revise at least two topics as a safety buffer.  However, he added that a member of university staff made matters more complicated. He said: Apparently a member of staff gave out a hint in a seminar that the sleep topic was definitely going to come up. “I did not hear this directly but the people that did only revised sleep, despite lecturers definitely saying to revise two topics.  He added: “Before the exam started there was lots of commotion as people made jokes about leaving the exam if the sleep topic wasn’t there. “But these jokes soon turned to tears for a lot of people when the paper was turned over and sleep was not on it. These tears resulted in a \u0027disturbance\u0027 during the exam, with many people choosing to get up and walk out. Because of this the university has offered students the chance to re-take the paper. The offer was made in an email sent round by Executive Dean, Andy Salmon.   In the email, he said: As you are aware we have investigated a number of complaints about the Advanced Cognitive \u0026amp Biological Psychology .    Following this investigation we decided that we would provide students who feel their exam was disrupted, with an extraordinary opt-in opportunity to resit this exam.  While the University is not obliged to provide this, we believe it is the equitable thing to do. However not all students were happy with the offer. One complained: “This is a complete farce and is also far more beneficial to those who caused the disruption than were disrupted.

Solicitors representing Michal Herba revealed judges have refused him permission to appeal against his extradition in the Supreme Court.  And the 37-year-old - who denies any involvement - will now face trial in Italy where his brother, Lukasz, has just been handed 16-year prison term. The decision will be officially announced in the High Court tomorrow. Herba’s solicitor, George Hepburne Scott, said: “I can confirm that I have just received notification from the High Court that the application to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused.  “This closes off the last possible avenue of appeal for Michal Herba and his return to Italy is now inevitable. “Under the relevant provisions of the Extradition Act 2003, he will be transferred to Italy by Italian police within 10 days.” Herba was arrested by the National Crime Agency near his home in the Tividale area of Sandwell, West Midlands, in August last year and his extradition was ordered in September. Prosecutors claim the Polish national helped his brother Lukasz 30, abduct Chloe, 20, in July last year. The mother of one, from Croydon, south London, was kidnapped when she arrived at an address in Milan, Italy, for a modelling job she had been contacted about online.  She was drugged and stuffed in a black bag before being told she would be auctioned off on the dark web for \u0026pound250,000. Chloe was then held for six days at a farmhouse before being released at the British consulate. Lukasz was this week handed 16 years in prison after being found guilty of holding her hostage for a €285,000 ransom. Chloe claimed the conviction vindicated her of any wrongdoing after speculation grew that he was part of the kidnap plot to boost her profile. She said: “I’m so very happy this is all over. I am very pleased and relieved by the outcome of today’s hearing.

It happened as Springwatch presenter Chris Packham spoke to weather presenter Carol Kirkwood by the River Windrush in Bourton-on-the-Water, the Costswolds. The two guys were noticed in the background of the footage, and although it wasn’t much of a shove, it sent the poor lad flying.

The charity found him to be a gentle giant and could have easily found him a new home - but never got the chance. Duncan was deemed \u0027dangerous\u0027 by the local authority and had to be put to sleep.  The charity is now calling on the Government to scrap legislation which it says is resulting in the needless deaths of thousands of innocent dogs like Duncan ahead of an MPs\u0027 inquiry into the Dangerous Dogs Act this week.   A Blue Cross animal welfare officer said: Duncan was in such a sorry state when he came into us. He was skin and bone - you could see his ribs. He also had a really bad infection and sores on his legs. He’d clearly never known a loving home and sadly we were unable to go on to help him have a happy ever after as we would with any other dog. He was loved by everyone who knew and treated him here at hospital. We found him to be a gentle giant and well behaved.  He knew his basic commands and was eager to learn more. We could have easily helped him to find a new loving home. The officer added: Sadly we see loving and well-behaved dogs like Duncan all too often who have not put a paw out of place and would make someone a fantastic pet but because of the current law our hands are tied and they are not given the chance to live. It is heart-breaking and extremely frustrating for all involved and often leaves a dark cloud over the hospital each time we have to euthanase an otherwise healthy pet because the law states their looks deem them dangerous. The national pet charity has launched a petition calling on the parliamentary under-secretary at DEFRA, Lord Gardiner. to repeal Section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 ahead of an Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee inquiry tomorrow.

Teachers want lessons in online safety included in the curriculum. And so Fortnite has become the latest Pied Piper terror for parents who fear their kids are being tempted into a world they have no knowledge or understanding about. Well either that or it’s just the latest craze that’ll come and go in the way a million others have done before, from Rubik’s Cubes and Tamagotchis through to Loom Bands and Slime.  From what I can make out from my kids’ explanations, it’s a kind of Minecraft meets Call Of Duty – a brightly coloured post apocalyptic cartoon world where survivors battle it out (a bit like Love Island, but with greater emotional depth).   My eight-year-old son has played it at friends’ houses and is desperate for it. I’ve told him that is absolutely fine, and I’d be more than happy for him to buy it with his birthday money. When he’s 12. In four years time. Which is, of course, SO UNFAIR. And I’m the MEANEST mum in the WHOLE world. And EVERYONE in his WHOLE class has it apart from him. Fortunately, I like a row. Several times a day. But I totally understand how other parents have crumbled under the pressure of a nagging child and ended up thinking: “What harm can it do?” According to my friends who have given in already, it’s not so much harm as deep frustration and a lot of rows. It clearly is addictive. And it’s not just kids who need lessons about online gaming - it’s parents too. Because tackling this new threat to family life is tough.

She claims he raped her after a drunken night out in Freshers\u0027 Week at St Andrews University in 2013.

His short message was then reposted by Ryanair’s official Twitter account to their 376,000 followers – a move which resulted in a predictable social media backlash.

A yellow warning has been issued for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and northern England between 3am and 3pm on Thursday. Heavy downpours and gusts of up to 70mph have been forecast as wet and windy lows from the Atlantic shake things up and drag wild weather towards the British Isles. The Met Office said the \u0027danger to life\u0027 warning is due to large waves in coastal regions and flying debris from the high winds. The weather warning reads: A very windy spell will develop during Wednesday night in association with a deep area of low pressure.  The strongest winds will reach the west coast during the early hours of Thursday before spreading eastwards during the day. Westerly winds are likely to gust between 50 and 60mph in many areas and possibly around 70mph in some exposed locations. Winds should gradually ease from the west during Thursday afternoon. In addition, a spell of heavy rain will accompany the wind with the highest rainfall totals over parts of western Scotland.    Conditions will turn much cooler and fresher from today, with strong winds and risk of gales by Thursday - especially across the northern half of Britain. Sarah Sammy, forecaster for The Weather Channel, said: Around mid-week, low pressure is expected to move in from the Atlantic bringing more persistent showery rain to Ireland at first and Britain later on. “Maximum temperatures will be generally 15-20C in the north and 19-23C in the south. “Later in the week it will be slightly cooler and more like 15-18C in the north and 18-21C in the south.” While there are no warnings in place in the south or in Wales, rain and wind are expected.  Charles Powell, press officer for the Met Office, said more stable conditions will return later in the month. “On Thursday, we’ll see some pretty wet and windy weather working its way through from the Atlantic.“From the 20th June onwards there’s a sign that we might start to see things becoming a bit more settled again, a bit drier.” Elsewhere, temperatures will tumble back down towards normal for the time of year further south, with some good spells of sunshine.

Footage shows him doing a back flip which causes his gun to fall on the floor. As he goes to retrieve it, it went off and accidentally fired a round. A man was shot in the lower leg and paramedics took him to hospital, where he is believed to be stable. After the shot rang out, the agent appears to walk away unconcerned despite his gun going off in the crowded club.  The bullet hit the victim in an artery in his leg, according to previous news reports. His attorney, Frank Azar, said the injury was serious but the man would recover.

A series of tests on animals in the US has proved the drugs can re-wire the brain and mend broken connections between neurons.  Scientists believe the research - which was published in the journal Cell Reports - may pave the way for a raft of new mental illness treatments on humans. In a range of tests using a wide range of psychedelic drugs, the brain structure in a number of flies and rats was found to be altered. The tested drugs included LSD, DMT - a psychedelic drug derived from ayahuasca, an Amazonian herbal tea - and DOI, an hallucinogenic form of amphetamine.  Scientists found that the use of DMT on rats allowed them to overcome fearful memories of suffering an electric shock. The test mimicked the treating of PTSD in humans. The tests also proved that the exposure to the hallucinogenic drugs leads to the growth of dendrites, dendritic spines and synapses, all of which help neurons communicate with one another. Researchers believe that the changes that took place in the animals\u0027 brains are almost certain to be replicated in humans too.   Previous experiments have shown psychedelic drugs produce similar effects across species.  Lead scientist Dr David Olson, from the University of California at Davis, said: People have long assumed that psychedelics are capable of altering neuronal structure, but this is the first study that clearly and unambiguously supports that hypothesis. It comes after Katamine, an anaesthetic used as a recreational club drug, was also proven to alter brain wiring.

Dentists in Mexico stumbled across the mystery circular mark when the 47-year-old patient went for a routine check-up.  Flummoxed by the mark, the dentist at the School of Dentistry at the Universidad de Montemorelos proceeded to question the patient about its cause.  The medic then agreed that the red skin, known as erythema, was likely to have been caused by the patient performing too much oral sex. Upon questioning, the man revealed he is sexually active with men and regularly performs oral sex, with the last occasion taking place just three days before his dental visit.  However the mark was symptomless and the patient was completely unaware of its existence prior to his dental visit. Medical professionals wrote about the case in a prestigious medical journal and warned other dentists to be on the lookout for such marks. Writing in the BMJ Case Reports, they explained how the red lesion appeared. The dentists wrote: The contact of the palate with the penile glands may cause a haematoma due to blunt trauma. We concluded the erythema on the soft palate was associated with the practice of oral sex.

The spooky footage was captured by mum Louise Lenton at Oldway Mansion, in Paignton, Devon, which dates back to the 19th century.  It shows her five-year-old boy doing laps around the car park at 5pm on Sunday, Devon Live reports.  But it is what\u0027s happening in the window, that has sparked the controversy, as the shape of a woman watching the boy can be clearly seen in the window of the first floor. Normally a sceptic on the paranormal, Louise cannot explain the appearance of the woman - who she describes as wearing period dress.

wrong place since 2007","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee City Council will review match day traffic controls close to Dens Park and Tannadice after a resident discovered parking restrictions in a nearby street had apparently been in the wrong place for 11 years.Nicola McRae, from Hindmarsh Avenue, turned detective after she challenged a £60 fine given to her son Darren, 23.Since 2007, the street has been subject to a traffic order during match days to alleviate congestion, when “no waiting” cones are placed along sections of the road.Darren had parked on the opposite side of the street to his mum’s house, where the cones were lined up, but still received a penalty charge notice.But after Nicola appealed, Darren received a letter from the council cancelling the fine because “there has been an error where the cones were placed on the day”.However Nicola, 43, who has lived in Hindmarsh Avenue for eight and a half years, said the cones had always been placed on her side of the street.And after asking for a copy of the traffic order, she realised the council had been making the same mistake every match day for as long as she’d lived there.Hindmarsh Avenue splits into two “legs”, east and west, and according to the order, cones should be placed on the opposite side of the street from the houses.But instead, officials have been placing them on the housing side, effectively invalidating the council order.Nicola said: “The order says they’re supposed to be on the other side of the street from the houses, but they’re always put out on our side.“I’ve now got a letter back saying the fine has been cancelled.“My neighbour, who paid her fine, has been told she is due a refund.”She added: “The order’s been in place since 2007, so they must have been doing it for 11 years.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “Ahead of the new season we will be looking at the issues that have arisen and will talking to both football clubs about these.”Nicola also submitted a freedom of information request asking how many people had been fined under the traffic restrictions since 2007.It revealed 13 parking charge notices had been issued in that time, seven of which had been appealed, all successfully. The remaining six charges were refunded.Nicola said: “I can’t believe it’s only 13 fines in 11 years.“Given how many cars come down here, you would think there would have been a lot more.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face competition from motherwell in bid bring simon murray back to dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee face competition if they are to make a move to bring striker Simon Murray back to Dens Park.Murray spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dark Blues from parent club Hibs and said he was open to a return – but only if the Edinburgh side went with another striking option.His first choice was to try to prove himself at Easter Road after an up-and- down debut campaign there.Whether he has the chance to do that is up in the air after Motherwell moved to take him to Fir Park.The Steelmen have reportedly had a bid of £50,000 turned down by Hibs for the striker as they look to add to their attack.And that’s unlikely to be the end of any interest in the 26-year-old with ’Well expected to continue their pursuit.A number of European clubs have also been keeping tabs on him since his Dundee United days.The Tangerines, too, have made advances to bring him back to Tannadice.The lure of a return to boyhood heroes Dundee on a permanent basis would be big for Murray, though whether manager Neil McCann is prepared to splash cash on the former-Arbroath man remains to be seen.In 14 games for the Dark Blues last season, Murray managed just the three goals despite some good performances. Gaffer Neil suggested Murray was just trying too hard to shine in front of his fellow-Dundee supporters and was happy with his contribution.The Dee boss is desperate to add more threat to his side and is expected to take his time before making a move for a new forward.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee nightclubs proposal for extra hours at special occasions withdrawn","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee nightclub has withdrawn its plans to open for longer during special events.Industry Nightclub on Seagate had applied for permission to extend its hours by 30 minutes across five separate periods in the next six months.It wanted to add an extra half hour to the end of its day during Broughty Ferry Gala Week, the annual trades holiday, the autumn break, Halloween and Christmas.The club, owned by local businessman Tahir Ramzan, opens three days a week between Thursday and Saturday.However, the application for the extended hours – up to 3.30am from its usual closing time of 3am – was withdrawn by club bosses, just days before it was due to be considered by the council’s licensing board.A spokesman for the club said: “The applications have been withdrawn as we don’t need it anymore. We already have a 3am licence.”However, there are concerns among bar and club owners that Dundee’s nightlife scene is languishing as more and more people choose to stay in rather than go out.One bar insider said: “Dundee is pretty quiet at the moment.“Big holidays aren’t bringing any extra business in.“Back in the day you would have 2,000, maybe even 3,000 people out in the town each night at the weekend.“But it’s not like that any more.”Industry’s application had been met with opposition from Police Scotland, who had concerns over issues that the extended opening hours could have brought.Iain Livingstone, acting chief constable, had put forward objections on behalf of the service, claiming the extra hours would lead to a rise in crime.The club is the subject of an intervention plan put in place by police owing to what the service claims are “numerous” issues at the premises with under-age drinkers and alleged “poor stewarding”.However, since the introduction of the plan, Industry has responded with a “belt and braces” approach to tackling fake IDs, requiring guests to have two forms of ID to get in.The club has also rolled out its own unique ID card scheme which regular patrons can sign up to.The city licensing board will consider other applications on

“lucky” life but, upon retirement, decided to trace his family history. He has uncovered ties to Dundee and is appealing to anyone who may have known his mother, whose birth certificate he has not found.He believes his mum, Irene Miller or Millar, was born in Canada but grew up and worked in Dundee.

He’ll take some shifting for Jack.“What it will do is push Parish to be as good as he can because he knows Jack will be breathing down his neck.”After a steady first season at the now renamed Kilmac Stadium, Parish will feel he’s the current No 1 at the club but the arrival of another senior goalie can spur both to excel – and that’s good news for the Dark Blues.Hamilton has represented Scotland at every age level from U/15 to U/21 and was called up to a squad by Gordon Strachan in May 2016.He didn’t get a first senior cap but Soutar reckons he can push his way back into the national set-up by impressing for Dundee.He added: “Not so long ago he was in the Scotland squad.“He maybe lost a bit of confidence last season at Hearts and being on the bench.“He’s very professional and will push himself to the max to make sure he’s ready for pre-season at Dundee.“He’s very level-headed, he’s not one for the big-time if you know what I mean, he’s not a flashy kind of guy.“I know the kind of level Jack can play at, I’ve worked with him and I think he could get himself back in the Scotland set-up while at Dundee.“Whatever fee was paid, he’ll definitely justify it.“Further down the line, he could even get Dundee a fee if he moves on so, for that reason, I think it’s a great piece of business.“Working with (goalkeeping coach) Rab Geddes every week, too, can only bring the best out in Jack.“A three-year deal gives him security and playing for a manager who wants him in Neil McCann will help no end.”The former Dundee and Aberdeen goalie, meanwhile, is still going strong with his Derek Soutar Goalkeeping Academy.“It’s still going really well,” he added. “That’s us had 38 goalies over seven years go on to play pro-youth and we’ve had one recently go out to the US for a scholarship.”Any budding young goalies can find out more on the academy’s Facebook page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorhome owners due 800k as local firm goes bust","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn estimated 60 motorhome owners are owed around £800,000 by a local trader which went bust and is being probed by police.St Andrews Motorhomes was put into liquidation last week after 25 years in business.The sudden closure left those who handed over vehicles to director Christine Galloway fearing they could be left thousands of pounds out of pocket.However, liquidator Claire Middlebrook has offered assurance that she will try to recover substantial sums for everyone involved.Ms Middlebrook said: “I’m acutely aware of the anger felt by every owner at the actions of Christine Galloway’s company.“I strongly advise creditors they should hold off any legal action and allow me as liquidator to recover as much as possible of the value of their motorhomes.“I will very quickly assess the company’s remaining assets and it is then my legal responsibility to refund everyone to the highest possible value.”Clients had handed over motorhomes in brokerage deals, allowing the firm based near Cupar to sell them on their behalf.

It’s only an hour a week for me – but it can mean a lot to him.”Breakthrough is based in two Dundee secondary schools — Morgan Academy and St Paul’s RC Academy.In September, the project will launch in an additional four schools, Harris Academy, St John’s RC High School, Baldragon Academy and Craigie High, which means demand for mentors will increase.The project is currently engaging with 84 young people across the first two schools with 31 active mentors.A further 43 mentors are ready to be matched with a young person and another 62 are waiting to be trained.Ali’s mentee said: “The thing I like most about my mentor is that he helps me get work placements and helps me choose a career but also he’s there to support me and basically be a friend. The thing I like most about being mentored is that someone is sharing their experiences on what to do in interviews and jobs.“I’d like to say thank you to Ali for always doing his best with me and being there for me.”Jenny Patterson, CEO of Breakthrough Dundee, said: “The commitment, energy and enthusiasm that Ali and our other Breakthrough mentors bring to their role is already having a life-changing impact on our young people.“The difference they have made in a relatively short period of time is nothing short of incredible.”For more information, visit breakthroughdundee/mentor.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new rule all dundee united players must live within 25 miles of tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United chairman Mike Martin has vowed the club will not continue to “reward failure” in a shake-up of the wage structure.Martin took overall charge of the club in March and is conducting an overhaul of how the club is run.He said: “We have put a new wage structure in place which is split between Championship and Premiership, ensuring players coming to the club know what they will be paid in the Championship but also know the earning opportunity once we are back in the top flight.“Linked to that, we have increased the reward element of total pay.

We don’t want a corporate festival.“We’re hoping to get up to 5,000 people in the city centre on the day.”Dundee Pride has held several consultation evenings ahead of the main event.And Tim said the group is looking to recruit even more volunteers in a bid to grow Pride for the future.He added: “We absolutely want to have a successful event this year but we have to make sure we are ready for the future.“In our constitution we want to have two events a year which would be Pride and an LGBT awards.“We’re already starting to do a bit of work on that.“But we need the volunteers and trustees for the long-term sustainability.

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Wednesday 13 Jun 2018 6:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful.

At its peak there were 2,500 workers on site.A new campaign called GoNorthEast is also set to promote safety ahead of the bypass opening.Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Keith Brown said: “We estimate there will be 80 less accidents a year, one of which would be fatal – so there are huge benefits to the local area.“We’re looking towards completion around October/November this year. If we can do it earlier than that, we will.“But we need to do this in a safe way. That’s important for this huge project which has had one or two issues, such as Storm Frank, which set it back by a few months.“Of course we’ve had the collapse of Carillion which has meant that some other projects on this scale have been mothballed or delayed substantially.“But what we’re seeing now is this road going ahead, with big parts of it almost ready for cars to go on to.“We need to do this in a safe way. People have been waiting 60 to 70 years for this project.“We do acknowledge, of course, the disruption that’s been there but this will be a fantastic addition to the roads network.“It’ll make transport in this area safer and it’ll make it greener.”Chief Inspector of road policing in the north of Scotland Stewart Mackie added: “When the road opens it will be one of the safest in the country. We will have police patrols on the road as well.“It’s new, so we want to encourage people to take their time and take care until they get to know it.”Emma Bellu, chief executive of safety charity Absafe, praised the project’s aim to reduce road accidents by around 80 per year.“Communities in the north-east have long awaited improvements to the local road network that can reduce the injury toll on our roads,” she said.“Using the latest in safe road design, the AWPR/B-T will improve safety and reduce accidents by taking traffic away from unsuitable rural roads and urban areas.“This will make journeys safer and less stressful for drivers and give streets back to their communities.“This project can quite literally save lives, reduce injuries and improve wellbeing and we welcome the celebration in the run-up to the official opening.”Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “A fully operational AWPR will be a huge boost to our area.“Forecasts suggest the economic benefit it will bring to the regional economy is in excess of £6 billion over the next three decades as well as providing a platform for the creation of 14,000 new jobs.“In addition to improving the quality of life for our residents – a major factor in economic development – faster journey times and improved north to south connectivity will increase business productivity and help us to secure the next tranche of investment we need to deliver our renaissance region vision.”As revealed in later editions of yesterday’s Evening Express, project bosses have said that following the completion of the route in the River Dee valley there will be a weekend of community events on September 8-9.Attractions will include a travel through the ages showcase, with a display of vintage vehicles.There will also be the chance for cyclists to travel along the stretch in the area prior to its opening – which they will not be able to do afterwards.Mr Brown added: “We will be involving businesses as well to make sure they’re aware of the benefits that arise from the opening of the new road.“It’s about the local community. This is their road.“It’s been built for their benefit, for individuals and businesses.“They are the people who have paid for it. The taxpayers paid for this road so I think they are entitled to feel a part of it through education initiatives, competitions and business events.“We want communities to take ownership of this road.“We estimate around £6bn of economic benefit to the north-east in the opening of this road over a 30-year period.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b1f636d3e6c6-860x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeens newton dee to feature in tv show tonight1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA documentary about a north-east village where people with learning disabilities live and work is to be shown on TV.The programme, called Village of Dreams, will focus on Newton Dee and will air tonight.More than 80 adults with learning disabilities, autism and Down’s Syndrome live at the Camphill Community Campus site, which opened in Bieldside in 1960.There are also a variety of on-site enterprises, such as a toy shop, bakery and metal workshop which the adults work in, with all of the items created sold in the stores and online.A crew from Hopscotch Films spent a year at the village filming everyday life for the BBC documentary, which encompasses how the residents live and work.Jake Vollrath, long-term co-worker at Newton Dee, said: “They started filming almost exactly one year ago.“The film company actually contacted us which was quite nice.“Someone working there had grown up near to Aberdeen.“She had come to the cafe and the store when she was younger and kind of had a rough idea of what we were about.“We were initially a bit nervous and unsure.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me. I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

after it was confirmed this week that the Post Office is returning to the town.\nAt the meeting of the town\u0026rsquos community council on Monday evening, chairman Marshall Douglas revealed that the owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here in Innerleithen.\n\u0026ldquoSusan has confirmed that the new Post Office concession will be opening on Wednesday, August 29, at 1pm.\nThe delivery of the news brings an end to a long-running saga to reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival. The remainder will purchase new equipment.In June 2012, what started out as a return exchange with Lochgilphead resulted in CDJFA\u0026#8217s idea for an annual football festival. Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Cockenzie and Port Seton Gala 2018","story":"              IT WAS a brilliant gala day in Cockenzie and Port Seton today.

If the proposal to East Renfrewshire Council\u0026rsquos planning committee goes through, the project would create more than 365 permanent jobs over the next 30 years, contributing more than \u0026pound74 million to the local economy within that time frame.  Developers have said the \u0026ldquounique development would challenge the perception of what a retirement scheme should be by offering a wide variety of modern facilities to encourage activity and foster a strong community.  The extensive list of facilities would include a clubhouse overlooking a reservoir, a fully equipped gym, spa amenities and various dining options.  The scheme involves an improvement of a previous application that was recommended for approval.

The development comprises 214 one and two-bedroom flats and 38 cottages as well as an 80-bed care home which would be built adjacent to the development, offering extensive care amenities and specialist services, providing 24-hour support to residents.  Among the extensive list of on-site facilities, which will be used by both residents and the wider community, will be: a central two-storey clubhouse, tidal pools, spa facilities, a fitness suite, multi-use spaces for community events, a clinic, a contemporary restaurant, function suites and various shops.  The proposal will incorporate the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents, said developers.  The project will be the most sustainable of its kind in Scotland, with a district energy centre and heating system to provide the most environmentally-friendly power at the lowest price.  A reservoir on the site dating back to 1850 will be incorporated into the overall development with plans to create walkways around the water feature, which will be stocked with trout for fishing.  Gardens and places to socialise will be a major priority along with the provision of garden sheds and barbecue and picnic areas.

He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development - it will create a vibrant new community.  \u0026ldquoBy incorporating the latest thinking, contemporary design features and activities ranging from yoga to fishing, this development aims to reinvent the concept of retirement living in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.

In a statement at Holyrood Further and Higher Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville announced that the threshold for higher education bursaries would be raised from \u0026pound19,000 to \u0026pound21,000 from 2019/20.  Bursary support for the poorest young students in higher education will be increased from \u0026pound1,875 to \u0026pound2,000 a year.  Combined the two measures will benefit 13,500 students, she said.  Support for the poorest independent students will also rise from \u0026pound875 a year to \u0026pound1,000 benefiting nearly 18,000.  Bursary support in further education will also rise to up to \u0026pound4,500 a year, with all eligible students aged 18 and over receiving a guaranteed bursary award.  The minister was expanding on steps set out by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP conference in Aberdeen at the weekend, including more than \u0026pound21 million of investment, an increase in the bursary for care-experienced students to \u0026pound8,100 and raising the repayment threshold for student loans to \u0026pound25,000.  Ms Somerville said: \"Any changes being introduced or considered are with the poorest students at the forefront of my thinking.  \"I want to ensure that any prospective student, regardless of their background, are equipped with what they need to fulfil their potential.\"  She said the government would further investigate other areas highlighted in a recent review, including support for students on benefits, part-time and disabled students and carers, with a forthcoming consultation.  Tory MSP Liz Smith pointed out that bursary support for the poorest students in higher education was \u0026pound2,640 in 2013.  She also urged the government to explain why the full range of changes were not going to be made until 2021 and said she was disappointed that part-time students \"received scant mention\" in the statement.  Labour\u0027s Iain Gray said the government was \"refusing\" to abide by a key recommendation of the review that all students should have access to the equivalent of the real living wage, \u0026pound8,100.  He said: \"Meanwhile the increase in higher education grants does not even restore them to what they were in 2013 in real terms.  \"Yet again it is going to pile even more debt onto students.\"  He urged the minister to \"do the right thing and restore grants to levels the SNP found them at when they came to power\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Adam Kennedy  How I lost the head     and found myself","story":"              I can remember the night vividly. I was playing football with a few of my friends at the local pitches. The rage that hit me as we were knocked out of the tournament was like never before. I can remember being so angry that I kicked the bags next to the goals containing our stuff, smashing a friend\u0026rsquos phone screen in the process. The rest of the boys were laughing as I was going ballistic and this was all over a game of football \u0026ndash I regret it to this day but looking back it was just what I\u0026rsquod needed.  I knew at this point that there was something wrong with me. For the rest of evening, I said nothing apart from apologising to my friend about his screen and offering to pay for a new one. I had never wanted to cry so much in my life but I held it together as I didn\u0026rsquot want to totally embarrass myself in front of my friends.  As soon as I got home, I rushed upstairs, avoiding any conversation with my family. I knew exactly the person to ring, my gran. She was the best listener anyone could have hoped for \u0026ndash always looking to help anybody out. I poured my heart out, told her every issue I\u0026rsquod ever had in the run up to this point whether it be substance abuse, entire summers spent solely in my room or the fact that my confidence with girls was at an all-time low. I didn\u0026rsquot particularly want to do anything or go anywhere, even pulling out of a boys\u0026rsquo holiday with some of my best friends.  I was spending days at school, working at McDonald\u0026rsquos at the weekends and not enjoying a single minute of it. Rejection from Heriot-Watt University. Rejection from IKEA looking to upgrade my part-time job made me feel like a total loser.  I\u0026rsquod been made Head Boy at Penicuik High School but felt like a below average student and kept saying that I\u0026rsquod been appointed because \u0026ldquothe staff felt sorry for me.  As I sat there, blubbing away, my gran told me to see a doctor. It was her that took me to my first doctor\u0026rsquos appointment and then counselling session. We\u0026rsquod had my future counsellor, obviously I didn\u0026rsquot know at the time, from MYPAS (Midlothian Young People\u0026rsquos Advice Service) speak to the school and I had previously put my name down on the sly but the doctor arranged an appointment sooner for me knowing that I was in trouble.  The counselling was great. It\u0026rsquos an experience that I went into with the most pessimistic approach possible. I couldn\u0026rsquot have seen how talking to a complete stranger who didn\u0026rsquot know me, my family, friends or girlfriend was in any way going to benefit me given she couldn\u0026rsquot put names to faces and wouldn\u0026rsquot know them if she bumped into them in the street. My counsellor, Angela Robb, was excellent and didn\u0026rsquot care about them, this was about me and what I was going through. I saw her for 12 sessions, because when I\u0026rsquod got to the end of my initial 10, I felt as though I wasn\u0026rsquot necessarily \u0026lsquothere\u0026rsquo yet so she was able to provide me with more sessions.  Robb said: \u0026ldquoCounselling is unique to each client and whilst there are some common factors in every therapeutic relationship, I tailor how I work, taking my lead from each person. It\u0026rsquos key to successful counselling to be able to form safe and trusting therapeutic relationships. I feel that I do this and my client\u0026rsquos outcomes and feedback suggest this is true.  But it was not only me going through such a horrendous ordeal. Some of the statistics and facts are alarming. According to menshealth, 9% of men go through depression on a daily basis, more than 6 million men. On top of that, 3 million men are hit with a form of anxiety every day.  Why is this the case? I spoke to Jane Anderson, a mental health nurse at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline.  \u0026ldquoI have been a mental health nurse for eight years and have probably nursed hundreds of patients, some you\u0026rsquoll never see again and others I\u0026rsquove nursed several times. As difficult as it can be some days it is also very rewarding.  Anderson says: \u0026ldquoWe are a recovery focused ward and building a therapeutic relationship initially with patients can be challenging. However, when there is an understanding that our goals are the same \u0026ndash ie to get a better level of health and be discharged \u0026ndash working alongside a patient developing care plans to suit their individual needs and treating people with respect. I don\u0026rsquot expect thanks but even seeing someone smile when they have been so unwell is a fantastic feeling.  She said there was still an unwillingness among men to admit that they have a mental health issue. \u0026ldquoBy the time they are admitted either informally of formally [sectioned under the mental health act] there is some recognition from the person that they are unwell. In the community, however, stigma is still very prevalent. The perception that males are raised to be stoic, brave and strong further enforces this belief.  I asked her what factors could lead to compound mental health issues. \u0026ldquoLack of knowledge and understanding, embarrassment, feeling of failure, fear of letting others down and looking weak, Anderson said. \u0026ldquoThis can be a generational issue, older males are less likely to be open about their mental health, younger males are more open although don\u0026rsquot necessarily accept it.  Although there is more discussion of these issues in society than ever before, I began to wonder what more could be done to raise awareness. I asked Anderson if she felt that men could be reached by information during entertainment and sporting events.  She said: \u0026ldquoI suppose the \u0026lsquoproblem\u0026rsquo is that mental health isn\u0026rsquot a nice happy topic so would turn people off from watching. We live in a consumer society, happiness and laughter brings viewers and readers and makes money for the big television and media companies.  I\u0026rsquom a huge football fan and it amazes me when I see people literally living my dream who aren\u0026rsquot entirely satisfied and perhaps feel that they never will be. The cases in Scotland with David Cox of Cowdenbeath who was taunted by a rival fan, \u0026ldquoAway and hang yourself and do it right this time, and James Keatings (formerly of my beloved Heart of Midlothian) recently sharing his battles on Twitter despite playing for three of the country\u0026rsquos biggest clubs. Even a Barcelona academy graduate, Bojan Krkic, came out and said: \u0026ldquoI had anxiety attacks but no one wants to talk about that. Football\u0026rsquos not interested.  That speaks volumes to me about the prevalence of mental health problems. Krkic has graduated from one of the leading academies in world football, has played in several of Europe\u0026rsquos major leagues (Spain, Italy, England, Germany and the Netherlands) and has presumably amassed a healthy standard of living through an astronomical wage but still suffers.  It\u0027s not a new problem. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was said to have reportedly experienced severe depression and supposedly contemplated suicide, often weeping uncontrollably. A key figure in the scientific revolution, Sir Isaac Newton, was seemingly psychotic, and prone to dramatic mood swings with numerous authors suggesting he was bipolar or schizophrenic. Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most famous artists of all time, was another affected. His enthusiasm for art came along with his fast-paced painting followed by deep depression and an apparent bipolar disorder.  In more recent times, many in the entertainment industry have committed suicide due to mental health problems. Frightened Rabbit\u0027s singer Scott Hutchison and the actor Robin Williams are all examples of people who, seemingly with the world at their feet, who have taken their own lives. It should never have to be this way.  Some may see suicide as the brave way out but the most courageous act you can take if you are suffering is to do something about it yourself and surround yourself with a loving family, supportive friends and people that ultimately want to put you right.  And, please, please, get help.

New legislation being introduced to Holyrood would hand councils extra powers to prohibit parking on pavements and double parking.  Previous efforts to address the issue were held up by various complications, including whether the necessary powers were devolved to Scotland.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos wide-ranging Transport Bill also aims to give councils more flexibility in running bus services, through working with operators, local franchising or running services themselves.  It also allows for the creation of low emission zones \u0026ndash such as that proposed in Glasgow \u0026ndash which will be under civil rather than criminal enforcement.  Transport minister Humza Yousaf said the legislation would give local authorities a new model to revitalise bus services.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are also providing clearer options for authorities to pursue local franchising or provide services themselves in appropriate circumstances.  \"Beyond bus services, this Bill will allow for decriminalised enforcement of low emission zones, double parking and parking on pavements.  \"This will help transform our towns and cities into cleaner, more accessible and more pleasant spaces to travel and enjoy.  The new proposals would also strengthen the technology underpinning \u0026ldquosmart ticketing, which could eventually allow all journeys on Scotland\u0026rsquos bus, rail, ferry, subway and tram networks to be linked into one payment system.  But critics described the legislation as a \"missed opportunity\" \u0026ndash insisting many of the measures don\u0026rsquot go far enough.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Colin Smyth said the SNP\u0026rsquos plans would mean \"public ownership of bus routes can only happen in very restricted circumstances.  He said: \"This would leave local councils picking up the pieces, running the very few loss-making routes whilst transport tycoons line their pockets on the rest of the bus network.\"  Green MSP John Finnie said: \"While we are pleased the Bill includes provision for local authorities to provide their own bus routes in areas where communities have been left behind by private operators, it is disappointing that it does not allow for the re-regulation of buses so that local authorities can choose to bring all bus services under public ownership.  \"There\u0027s also not a single mention for trains. This was an opportunity for the government to pave the way for a public bid for the ScotRail franchise and disappointingly they haven\u0027t taken it.\"  Scottish Conservative Donald Cameron MSP said some of the proposals would \u0026ldquoexacerbate feelings that the Scottish Government has an anti-car agenda."},{"url":null,"title":"Report  Transfer teachers between schools every five years to raise standards","story":"              MOVING teachers between schools every five years can help raise standards, according to international experts.  A major report on schools in the developed world said staff rotation in Japan and Korea helped spread innovative teaching techniques.  The OECD report also highlighted cash incentives as a way of attracting the best teachers to schools in deprived areas.  And there was a boost to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos policy of giving more power to headteachers.  The Effective Teacher Policies report said letting schools hire staff - a key plank of Education Secretary John Swinney\u0026rsquos reforms - led to improvements in pupil performance.  The report said: \u0026ldquoCountries with strong centralised traditions of teacher management could consider creating a mobility requirement, such as exists in Japan and Korea.  \u0026ldquoToo limited mobility of teachers between schools ... can hinder the spread of new ideas and approaches.  \u0026ldquoBy introducing a requirement for teacher mobility every five to seven years might stimulate continuous professional growth while also ensuring that effective teachers are fairly distributed across schools.  The report said opponents of school autonomy often voiced concerns that greater independence would lead to an education system that exacerbated economic and social inequities.  But it added: \u0026ldquoIn fact, many countries have been able to combine extensive autonomy with strong incentives to ensure schools prioritise student learning.  \u0026ldquoIf school leaders have some freedom to adapt teachers\u0026rsquo responsibilities, working conditions and pay to reflect the difficulty of tasks, they are better able to attract the most talented teachers to the most challenging classrooms.  \u0026ldquoOn average increases in school responsibility for selecting teachers for hire were associated with improvements in student achievement.  However, the report warned against giving more power to headteachers over hiring of staff too quickly.  \u0026ldquoSchool leaders\u0026rsquo capacity to manage human resources cannot be created overnight, it said.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said moving teachers between schools could be disruptive for staff and children.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod prefer the priority to be making sure every school has the teachers it needs and that those teachers are of the highest calibre.  Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers\u0026rsquo Association, said the union would be interested in discussing the idea.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers should be encouraged to work across different schools to gain experience and pass on knowledge.  \u0026ldquoHowever, those who move across schools would need to be paid for the additional responsibilities and experience.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union highlighted another of the report\u0027s findings - that countries which paid the highest salaries had fewer difficulties recruiting.  He said: \"Improving salaries is essential in making teaching a more attractive and desirable career option for highly qualified students.  \"In Scotland, teacher salaries have been eroded over the past decade.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said its education reforms were focused on giving schools and headteachers more power and money to raise standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are based on international evidence of how high-performing education systems work \u0026ndash delivering extra help for teachers in the classroom, more professional development and a stronger voice for parents and pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"Landmark surgery helps baby boy to reach his first birthday","story":"              Little Noah Connell\u0026rsquos parents were told several times that their baby boy was going to die.  With rare facial deformities which mean his life is at risk every day, the tot has undergone eight gruelling operations in his young life - including one surgery which was the first of its kind anywhere in the world.  Even swallowing his own saliva or a drop of rain could kill him, but against all odds the determined toddler has survived to celebrate his first birthday.  His parents, Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, said was a \u0026ldquomassive milestone for the whole family.  Miss Gordon, from Robroyston, Glasgow, said: \u0026ldquoWe were told on numerous occasions that Noah wasn\u0026rsquot going to make it.  \u0026ldquoFor anyone, their baby reaching one is a big deal, but it was a bit bigger for us because we have had so many hurdles to overcome.  \u0026ldquoHe had a birthday party with all our friends and family at a soft play area and then went to Blair Drummond Safari Park, who set up a special visit for us.  \u0026ldquoIt was really emotional, it\u0026rsquos amazing how much he has come on in the last year.  \u0026ldquoIt is a massive milestone for us and Noah. \u0026ldquo  Noah\u0026rsquos arrival into the world was a massive shock to his parents as Miss Gordon didn\u0026rsquot know she was pregnant.  She was suffering from bad stomach pains which turned out to be labour.  However, her surprise quickly gave way to worry as it became clear that something was wrong with the baby.  Doctors knew instantly that something was wrong with Noah, who was born \u0026ldquolooking like he had no jaw.  His condition, known as hemifacial microsomia, means the lower half of one side of the face is underdeveloped and does not grow normally.  He also has Pierre Robin syndrome \u0026ndash a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems in feeding and breathing.  He has a small neck, floppy airway and cleft palate and part of his spine is also missing.  The toddler\u0026rsquos condition is so severe that he cannot eat or drink because of the effect on his airway.  He is fed through a gastro tube and he can only have 620ml of a high-calorie solution every day to help him pile weight on and grow.  His mother explained that even being sick or swallowing a drop of rain could be enough to kill him.

We were blue-lighted to the hospital.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos scary but it\u0026rsquos just our normal - he is a happy wee boy.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how to feed a baby or make a bottle up. But dealing with tubes and wires are all normal to us because we don\u0026rsquot know any other way.  However, the family still has hope that Noah\u0026rsquos miracle surgery will allow him to eat and drink normally in the future.  The life-saving operation took place at Glasgow\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Children on March 8 and involved metal rods being inserted to his tiny face to help secure the bones and allow him to breathe.  The surgery, called mandibular jaw distraction, saw doctors break his jaw in two places, with the rods being put in place to straighten his face and push his tongue forward.  It was so rare that surgeons had to send to Germany and the US for parts and consulted with other experts to decide if the operation was even possible.  It is hoped that the \u0026ldquoscaffolding will eventually move his jaw forward and help to reduce his chances of choking.  For three weeks after the surgery Miss Gordon and Mr Connell had to learn how to turn the screws in the metalwork \u0026ndash a process that has to be done with exact precision.  Jade, who cares full time for Noah, said: \u0026ldquoSince his surgery, his jaw has moved forward 4cm which should loosen up his airways.  \u0026ldquoThe surgery has worked as well as it can do just now and the movement in Noah\u0026rsquos jaw is a big improvement.  She added that both she and Mr Connell were shocked to learn that he could be the first person in the world to have the revolutionary surgery, but had no choice but to place their trust in the medical staff.  \u0026ldquoWe asked the doctors if we could see pictures from other surgeries like the one Noah was going to have, she said. \u0026ldquoBut they said they couldn\u0026rsquot.  \u0026ldquoWe couldn\u0026rsquot believe it when they said Noah would be the first baby in the world to have the operation.  \u0026ldquoIt was daunting to hear that but we trusted them.  Noah is now at home with his mother and father, who is a college student.  They say they are trying to \u0026ldquolive a normal life before the metal rods are taken out of his face next month."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7909504.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scots give more than   1bn to charity in 2017 - but number of donors drops","story":"              SCOTS have given \u0026pound400 million\u0026nbspa year more to charity in 2017, even though there was a dip in the numbers feeling generous.  The latest report by the Charities Aid Foundation reveals that there has been a 50 per cent annual rise in donations to charity last year with the total given crashing through the \u0026pound1 billion barrier.  But the CAF said it was of \"some concern\" that there was a slight dip in the number of people giving money to charity year-on-year and that the rise is the result of the same number of people giving more, with the typical donation going up from \u0026pound36 in 2016 to \u0026pound60 in 2017.  It is believed the drop may be the result of a drop in trust in charities.  It comes as experts in the third sector earlier this year warned\u0026nbspin February that donations to Scottish charities could be damaged by the Oxfam sex scandal and public trust could be hit hard.  Oxfam workers in Haiti were accused of paying prostitutes and holding \u0026lsquoCaligula-style\u0026rsquo orgies, with participants allegedly including under-age girls, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake there.  It was then\u0026nbspalso alleged that the charity knew about concerns over the behaviour of Oxfam\u0026rsquos country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, in a previous posting in Chad.    Figures released by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in February showed that trust in charities had dropped by nine per cent over the last two years.  The SCVO findings prompted the group to launch a new campaign called I Love Charity, amid evidence that donations were being hit.  The CAF\u0026rsquos Scotland Giving report says Scotsgave an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to charity in 2017, up from the\u0026nbsp\u0026pound813 million donated in 2016.  It also said that in 2017, 63 per cent of Scots questioned claimed to have donated money to charity compared to 65 per cent in 2016.  The CAF survey report said: \"This leads to a key policy question about how to encourage giving and whether it should focus on getting more people to give or getting those who give to give more, or indeed, a combination of both.\"  Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) said: \u0026ldquoThe findings from CAF\u0026rsquos report are fairly positive as they show that although the number of people giving has decreased, the amount of money being donated to charities in Scotland has gone up, which is great.  \"Figures released by SCVO in February 2018 showed that while trust in charities in Scotland is still high, it has dropped by nine per cent over the last two years, which may help explain why the number of people giving is down.    \"However our survey also showed that trust in local charities remains strong, particularly where people had personal experience of a charity, so it may be that the increase in giving is down to the impact of the good work organisations do in communities.  The Institute of Fundraising said the dip in donors may be because charities are focusing on giving \"existing supporters an even better experience\" instead of concentrating on attracting new supporters.  Alex Close, head of Scotland at the Institute of Fundraising, said \"We\u0026rsquore pleased to hear that the generosity of the Scottish public continues and it\u0026rsquos great to see a rise in the donation amounts that people in Scotland say that they have given.  \"The increase is likely to be caused by a combination of factors, rather than one single reason, including people feeling more financially secure, or a great experience with a charity that inspires them to increase their regular donation.    \"Many charities have been focusing even more on giving existing supporters a great donor experience and inspiring them to increase their regular donations. We hope that this generous trend continues and the Scottish public continue to give to good causes. \"  CAF found that Scotland accounts for 11.8 per cent of all UK charitable donations, despite representing 8.4 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos population.  It found that the most popular causes supported by those in Scotland were children and young people, with 28 per cent of those surveyed saying they had donated to this cause. This was followed by medical research (27 per cent) and animal welfare (25 per cent). The report also found that two in three (66 per cent) of people took part in a charitable or social activity, such as volunteering for a charity, donating money or goods, or buying an ethical product.  More than half (56 per cent) of those interviewed said they signed a petition in the previous 12 months, while 27 per cent had done so over the previous four weeks.  The report is based on a a survey of 1061 people in Scotland.    Sir John Low, Charities Aid Foundation chief executive said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the total amount donated increasing across Scotland. Activism is also on the rise, perhaps re\u0026#64258ecting the turbulent times in which we live. This paints a picture of a thriving, vibrant society of which we should all be proud.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to take the work of our charities for granted \u0026ndash indeed CAF\u0026rsquos research over many years shows that millions of people benefit from their work without even realising it. But this report shows how much people value good causes. Without the support of these generous donors, we would all be so much the poorer."},{"url":null,"title":"Country walks  spas and fitness suites    welcome to the perfect place to retire","story":"              IT has been billed as Scotland\u0026rsquos first purpose-built retirement community and is predicted to change the way people live in their later years when the worries of work are behind them.  Plans have been unveiled for a new village designed to cater to the needs of the over-55s, with all amenities, facilities and services they require right on their doorsteps.  Developers say the \u0026pound55 million scheme, proposed for Netherplace reservoir in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, would be based on a \u0026ldquovision of active later living, and would be self-contained and come complete with medical services, leisure facilities and shops within its environs.  And they hope it could become the blueprint for other communities across Scotland if it is given approval when it goes before the local authority for assent later this week.  The Netherplace Retirement Development is the brainchild of property developer Shazad Bakhsh and is being taken forward by the Glasgow and Singapore-based property company Scotsbridge Holdings.  It would see the construction of 252 homes on the 17-acre former industrial site, made up of one and two-bedroom flats and cottages alongside a central \u0026ldquoclubhouse.  It would also incorporate a clinic and an 80-bed care home, as well as a fitness suite, spa, restaurant, community spaces and country walks.  Investments would be made in the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents.  Mr Bakhsh believes Netherplace could become one of the most innovative new communities for over-55s anywhere in the UK, and provide further inward investment to East Renfrewshire.  He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development, it will create a vibrant new community.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  Scotland is facing a demographic time bomb in the coming decades, with the number of pensioners expected to soar by almost 30 per cent in the next 25 years to 1.36 million by 2039, according to official figures from the Registers of Scotland.  Meanwhile, the number of over-75s is predicted to rise from 430,000 to about 800,000, while the working population paying taxes to meet the growing cost of public services is predicted to grow by just one per cent.  This will inevitably greatly impact on council budgets and the public purse, but Mr Bakhsh said that similar retirement communities help councils shoulder the burden by having services grouped together.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.  \u0026ldquoThe placement of these bespoke lifetime homes, with facilities which are second to none, will ensure a higher quality of living.  He added: \u0026ldquoOur professional and experienced team has a vision to modernise the sector and provide a development to both answer demand and exceed expectations.  Herald View: Older people need better housing options too  An independent economic impact study of the project estimates that the development will support more than 365 permanent jobs during the next 30 years, and contribute more than \u0026pound74m to the local economy .  It is also hoped that the purpose-built retirement community could help release much-needed housing stock elsewhere by allowing pensioners living in larger homes to downsize.  Netherplace reservoir, which dates back to 1850, will be incorporated into the overall design of the village and stocked with trout for fishing.  Demolition and clearance of the site, a former dye works which last operated in 2003, has already been completed to enable works to begin if planning permission is granted.  The development would be built across the road from Whitecraigs Rugby Club and immediately adjacent to the M77 motorway. A similar scheme was refused in 2015 amid objections from the community, social health and care partnership and Glasgow Airport.  Glasgow based practice Jewitt \u0026amp Wilkie Architects has been appointed to design the development. Founder Jonathan Jewitt said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove carried out thorough and extensive research on aspirational, high quality homes and engaged with numerous public and private bodies to achieve the optimum scheme proposal.  \u0026ldquoThis proposal includes a wide variety of unique features which have been subtly future-proofed to cater for the changing needs of residents.  \u0026ldquoIt is expected that housing currently occupied by one or two persons within the surrounding community will be released into the market for much-needed family housing."},{"url":null,"title":"Edinburgh wants to oust Sydney as best place to see in New Year","story":"              AS the first major city to welcome in the New Year, Sydney proudly boasts that it is hosts the most talked about party in the world.  But now organisers of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay event are gunning for the number one spot and hope to topple the Australian city from its perch.  The capital\u0026rsquos Hogmanay celebrations attracted 165,000 people last year, and had an economic impact of \u0026pound39 million, a new report states.  However, Underbelly, in its second year running the three-day event, wants Hogmanay to be the most talked about New Year celebration in the globe.  Around 10,000 more people, from 80 countries, attended the last Hogmanay event compared to 2017, and the organisers believe there still room for Edinburgh\u0026rsquos three-day New Year festival to grow.  Charlie Wood, director of Underbelly, said: \u0026ldquoOur plans aren\u0026rsquot about increasing that number of visitors, it is about increasing how Edinburgh and Scotland are viewed internationally.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about creating an event that is talked about, not just in the city, that notion of \u0026lsquoOh why wasn\u0026rsquot I there?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos the goal, its about creating those images and stories, that really sell the city and the country internationally.  Underbelly said its own research shows that Hogmanay generated 37 TV news pieces reaching 89 million viewers, 201 radio pieces reaching 141 million listeners, and more than 2,000 online articles reaching more than 10 billion readers, with 360 pieces in print. These figures helped lift Edinburgh from the 17th most covered New Year event in 2017 to joint 7th this year.  However, the short term aim, Mr Wood said, is to break into the top five, with a long term aim of being the most-visible New Year event in the globe.  The research shows the top New Year celebrations being covered internationally are Sydney at no 1, followed by Seoul and Hong Kong at joint 2nd, followed by New York, Singapore, and Paris, and then London and Edinburgh at joint seventh, followed by Tokyo, and Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Moscow at joint 10th.  Mr Wood added: \u0026ldquoIt cannot be an exact science, but it helps build a picture about how the world looks at Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoAnd our goal is to make sure that it beats every other city in the world as the city that everyone talks about - which is creatively we try to make it as different as possible.  \u0026ldquoThe aim is to get images and stories, about Hogmanay and about Scotland, all around the world.  The economic impact figure is 40 per cent higher than the last measurement, in 2010, of \u0026pound27.9m.  The last Hogmanay was the first staged by Underbelly for the City of Edinburgh Council, after being run by Peter Irvine\u0026rsquos Unique Events for more than 20 years.  Ed Bartlam, co-director, said: \u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot set out to throw away what was already great about the event, we kept that, Peter Irvine did so much brilliant stuff, we just wanted to turn it up a notch, and that\u0026rsquos what we want to continue doing for the next few years.  Research conducted by BOP Consulting also surveyed 5,236 attendees and found that Hogmanay was the main or only reason for visiting Scotland for 71% of attendees from elsewhere in the world, 74% of whom were attending Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay for the first time.  Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay is principally funded by City of Edinburgh Council.  More than one-third of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Hogmanay 2018 income came from public sector funding and 66% was from commercial sources of revenue including ticketing and sponsorship income.  Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted by the increased economic impact of the event on Edinburgh and Scotland to be an event that both encourages people to visit and creates employment in the city to have people from 80 countries buy tickets for the event but also see a strong local audience that engages and participates.  Ticket for Hogmanay 2019 are already on sale.  Councillor Donald Wilson, the culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council, said: \u0026ldquoUnderbelly certainly didn\u0026rsquot fail to impress in their first year producing the event and this report highlights just how much of a success the festival was with a whopping estimated economic impact of \u0026pound39.8m for Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"TV classic Dad  39 s Army goes on stamps to celebrate show  39 s 50th anniversary","story":"              A new set of eight stamps is being issued to mark the 50th anniversary of TV comedy classic Dad\u0027s Army.

Remain-supporting Phillip Lee quit as justice minister, saying \"if Brexit is worth doing, then it is certainly worth doing well\" and it is \"irresponsible to proceed as we are\".  He said his main objection to Government policy was over the \"wish to limit Parliament\u0027s role in contributing to the final outcome\" - the so-called meaningful vote amendment.  His shock departure came as David Davis warned potential Tory rebels that they cannot undo the EU referendum, ahead of a tricky 48 hours in which the Government will try to get its Brexit programme back on track.  The Brexit Secretary spoke after some Conservatives signalled that they would support an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal Bill) tabled late on Monday by former attorney general Dominic Grieve giving more power to MPs.  The Commons begins two days of debate and votes on the Bill on Tuesday and Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment calls for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons, setting out how to proceed in the event of a \"no deal\" Brexit.  But Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum.  \"We will put in front of Parliament the decision for them to vote ... after that there will be a process of primary legislation to put the actual details of it in Parliament, so Parliament will actually decide on the application of the detail.\"  Asked what would happen if they voted against the deal, he said: \"If they throw it out, well, they throw it out. We will have to go away, think about it and come back and make a statement, which is what I am saying to the House this afternoon.\"  The Prime Minister appeared to have defused a potentially explosive row over the EU customs union on Monday night as Tory pro-Europe rebels Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Bill Cash came together to table a separate compromise amendment backing \"a customs arrangement\" with the EU.  Government sources signalled to the Press Association that ministers were set to back the move. However, the compromise is only likely to delay a full-blown showdown on the customs union until trade legislation returns to the Commons in July.  Mrs May set the tone for a tense two days as she warned Tory Remainers that if they defied her and backed Lords amendments to the landmark Brexit legislation it would weaken Britain\u0027s hand at the negotiating table.  Addressing a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on Monday, ahead of the key votes, she said: \"I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.  \"But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\"  However, Devon Tory Sarah Wollaston signalled on Tuesday morning that she would back Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment.  Dismissing the Government\u0027s compromise, she tweeted: \"Merely issuing a statement in response would make it a meaningless final vote.  \"Grieve\u0027s amendment puts that right and in a way Govt could and should accept it.\"  She said unless there was a \"meaningful vote\" Parliament would be left with \"the grim choice between a poor deal and exit with no deal at all\".  It would also give hard Brexiteers the chance to \"scupper a good deal\", she claimed.  Sir Oliver defended his compromise agreement, saying it was \"sensible\" in delaying a vote on the customs plan until details were more settled.  Asked on Today if the amendment \"just kicked the can down the road\", he replied: \"That is a very sensible thing to do.  \"If you are engaged in trying to sort something which is complicated out, it makes sense to do it when you know what the thing that you are debating looks like.\"  Meanwhile, Ireland\u0027s premier raised the possibility of delaying Brexit to allow more time to negotiate the UK\u0027s exit deal.  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said extending the March 29 2019 departure date was one of a number of \"different scenarios\" that could be pursued if a withdrawal agreement fails to materialise in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Angus Grossart gives   1m to the revamp of the Burrell Collection","story":"              THE Scottish banker Sir Angus Grossart has given \u0026pound1m to the restoration of one of the nation\u0027s leading museums.

Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: \"These statistics are hugely encouraging and show we have almost halved the greenhouse gases emitted in Scotland - underlining our role as an international leader in the fight against climate change.  \"We all have a role to play in that fight and I want to thank the households, communities and businesses who are working hard every day to reduce their own emissions.  \"But we must go further and faster if we are to meet our responsibilities to our children, grandchildren, and future generations.  \"Our ambitious Climate Change Bill will ensure we do exactly that - by setting a new 90% reduction target for 2050 and paving the way towards achieving net-zero emissions as soon as possible.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspFarms at centre of new bid to halt climate change  While the reductions were welcomed by environmental campaigners, concerns were raised over the Government\u0027s level of ambition, and an increase in transport emissions, up 2.3% from 2015 to 2016.  Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell said: \"Progress on reducing the pollution that causes climate change is welcome but Scottish ministers cannot be serious if they think they are showing international leadership given they plan to slow down the rate of action.  \"They are trying to wriggle out of setting a zero carbon target in the new Climate Change Bill, when other countries are already pressing ahead.  \"A zero carbon target will drive the innovation we need in our economy to create new jobs, build warm homes and improve public transport.  \"In particular, we need to see action from government to reverse the worrying trend of rising numbers of cars on our roads driving an increase in transport emissions.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon gets on her bike for climate change  Tom Ballantine of campaign group Stop Climate Chaos Scotland (SCCS) said: \"It\u0027s great news that Scotland has hit the annual target and reduced its climate emissions by 45% compared to the 1990 baseline and is well ahead of the 42% 2020 target.\"  He said 2016 data reflected the first full year since the closure of Longannet power station, \"showing the big impact you can have by phasing out dirty coal and switching to clean renewables\"."},{"url":null,"title":"More ATMs across Scotland face closure as use of cash plummets","story":"              HUNDREDS more free cash machines face closure across Scotland in the coming years, following fresh warnings from the network responsible for the vast majority of UK withdrawals.  Bosses at LINK insisted they were doing \u0026ldquoeverything they possibly can to keep automated teller machines (ATMs) open in the communities where they are most needed.  But they admitted efforts to protect cash machines in remote areas would only be in place for four years and some could still close within that time.  LINK, the UK\u0026rsquos main cash machine network, is cutting the fee paid to operators from 25p to 20p per withdrawal over four years, but previously unveiled proposals to protect ATMs one kilometre or more from the next free machine.  It has led to worries that more than half of Scotland\u0027s 5,300 free-to-use ATMS could disappear.  However chairman Sir Mark Boleat admitted these measures would only plug the gap for the next few years, with \u0026ldquobigger issues looming if the number of people using ATMs continues to plummet.  He also appeared to predict widespread closures in cities, adding: \u0026ldquoThere are some city centres with 50 pay-to-use ATMs. We don\u0026rsquot think the public will be disadvantaged if that number falls to 40, or even to 30 or to 20.  Sir Mark said cash use had fallen by 30 per cent in the last 10 years, and was projected to drop by another 40 per cent in the coming decade.  And he insisted \u0026ldquofalling demand meant even protected ATMs could close in the next four years, despite a freeze on the fee paid to operators and additional financial incentives for machines in vulnerable areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf transactions fall by 40 per cent in the next 10 years, 30 or 40 per cent, there are bigger issues and we need to address those. Our own data shows consistently this year transactions have fallen by five per cent below last year.  In evidence to Holyrood\u0026rsquos economy committee, LINK estimated that up to 11 per cent of the UK\u0026rsquos cash machines may close as a result of the changes to operator fees. But some estimates have put the figure as high as 18 per cent.  Under questioning from MSPs, Sir Mark was unable to provide any breakdown of the impact on Scotland.  But he said 221 ATMs would be protected from fee changes north of the Border.  It came as Professor Russel Griggs, chairman of the new South of Scotland Economic Partnership, told the committee there is no evidence bank branch closures have a long-term effect on communities.  RBS is currently pushing forward with plans to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  Professor Griggs said work he had carried out suggested that while there was initially a \u0026ldquoheavy impact, communities moved on and found other ways of doing things.  He said: \"So I think it probably has a short-term effect but the evidence that I saw as I went around and visited probably 20 or 30 places across the whole of the UK looking at this, is that it settles down again and people go back to doing what they used to do but just in a different way and it\u0027s interesting they don\u0027t tend to move banks.\"  He said that during recent consultation meetings held with hundreds of people across the south of Scotland in connection with the new economic partnership, bank branch closures had been raised only once.  Thomas Docherty, public affairs manager for consumer organisation Which?, said there was a need for more robust evidence on the long-term effects of closures.  He said: \"There hasn\u0027t been a proper study done by anybody of what those longer-term impacts would be on the rate of closures.  \"By the end of this year in Scotland more than 250 branches will have closed in the last four years.  \"I think when you start to get that scale of closures somebody should be stepping up and carrying out that proper investigation.  \"The people who are most likely of course to be affected are older customers and customers who are more vulnerable.  \"Yes, online banking is growing but only 56 per cent of customers, according to UK Finance, currently use online banking, so what is happening to the other 44 per cent \u0026ndash how are their needs being serviced?\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7914297.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Scientists back reintroducing wolves to Scotland","story":"              THEY were the grey shadows of the ancient Caledonian forest, powerful predators who dominated their environment but then disappeared from Scotland centuries ago as their persecutors closed in.  Popular folklore has it that the last wolf was shot by Sir Ewen Cameron in 1680 in Killiecrankie, Perthshire, in 1680 - long after they had been driven from the lowlands by deforestation.  But in recent years a loud debate has erupted over plans to bring back these top carnivores to the Highlands, and let them run free to prey on the deer herds.  Now scientists say that rewilding the wolf could be more than a pipe dream and that a sustainable population is a possibility, but only if it is kept fenced in.  Researchers from the University of Sussex and the University of Kent, concluded that 80 wolves spread over an area of 1,000 square miles - roughly 24,000 acres - would be required to \"reduce\" deer herds which have been blamed for over-grazing and preventing the return of woodland.    The Scottish Government estimates that there are around 375,000 red deer and 350,000 roe deer living in Scotland, and each year an annual cull has to be held to reduce their numbers.  Dr Christopher Sandom, lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex with a particular interest in rewilding, believes that wolves could be the answer to the problem, and that it is possible to ensure they do not cross paths with people using the land.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspShould wolves be reintroduced to Scotland?  The issue of reintroducing wolves to Scotland has proven controversial in the past, with farmers and landowners saying that they would go after sheep and could even pose a danger to hikers.  But the University study found that the idea was viable if an area was created where their paths would seldom cross with people\u0027s  Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoReintroducing the wolf has long been suggested as part of the solution to large deer populations but there will always be concerns about how wolves interact with people in any rewilding project like this.  \"This research shows that they could actually have an extremely beneficial impact in terms of making the rewilding process more effective.  The research, which also involved scientists from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford (WildCRU), tackled the question of how many wolves would be needed in an area to bring down the number of red deer to allow ecological restoration.  It used computer models to simulate wolves impact on the landscape, and drew on previous studies of areas were the animals had been re-introduced or were already living.    The team\u0026rsquos analyses found that a fence capable of retaining at least 75 per cent of dispersing wolves within the reserve would be optimum in allowing for rapid population growth that could lead to reduced deer numbers, without the risk of having so many predators that the red deer population would be threatened.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservation charity backs bringing back wild carnivores to Scotland\u0027s countryside.  However, it is unlikely any wolves leaving the area would get far if proper procedures were put in place.  In Finland, all wolves leaving an expanding wolf population into a reindeer management area were shot before being able to reproduce, while in the Bia\u0026#322owie\u0026#380a National Park in Poland, surrounding human activity has created a barrier to wolf movement patterns.  Biologists found that the wolf population of Riding Mountain National Park in Canada had limited interbreeding with other wolf populations in nearby protected areas and no successful wolf dispersal from the park had been recorded over several multi-year tracking studies over 40 years.    Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoFences are a common but unpopular tool in biodiversity conservation and would ideally be avoided. But where there are conflicting interests, compromise is needed.  \"Fences particularly constrain animal dispersal but as Britain is an island, this is less of a problem. A fenced reserve in Scotland could be a fantastic opportunity to return large predators to Britain, ecologically restore a large part of the Scottish Highlands, and promote tourism.  The researchers suggested that grey wolves, also known as timber wolves, would be the best candidates to be reintroduced in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  A previous experiment in Yellowstone national park in the US found that bringing back wolves to cull deer herds led to forests coming back and more biodiversity. It has since been hailed a major success story.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspLynx should be brought back to roam Scotland  Dr Joseph Bull, lecturer in conservation science at the University of Kent, said: \u0026ldquoWolves are glorious animals, and were originally natives of these shores. The idea of them returning will be thrilling for many people.  \u0026ldquoWhile our model offers insights into what is likely to happen, the crucial next step would be to test these ideas in practice \u0026ndash by creating a reserve, reintroducing wolves, and closely monitoring the system.\u0026nbsp  \"More generally and perhaps counterintuitively, barriers in some form might have a more important role to play in establishing modern wild areas than previously thought\".    Professor David Macdonald, Director of WildCRU and co-author of the study said \u0026ldquoScotland can lead Europe in thinking about how conservation, large fenced reserves and tourism can reframe rural economies.  \"The role of fencing in the conservation of big predators is globally a hot topic. So far our results are just simulations made from the safety of a desk, but they offer a highly original way of thinking about restoring nature and natural processes."},{"url":null,"title":"Pupils from armed forces families    less likely    to go to university","story":"              PUPILS whose families serve in the armed forces are less likely to go to university because of the significant disruption they face at school, campaigners have warned.  A new survey found one in four Scottish pupils from a services background attended at least seven schools as a result of parents being posted to different locations across the UK and beyond.  In one extreme case a pupil had been to 27 different schools between starting nursery and leaving secondary.  As a result of the disruption some 70 per cent said they lacked confidence, 71 per cent had experienced anxiety and 60 per cent said they had found studying difficult.  In addition, one in five said they had experienced difficulties with friendships and 44 per cent said they had felt isolated.  The Royal Caledonian Education Trust (RCET), a 200-year-old charity for armed forces children, said pupils from a military background were one third less likely to go to university than their civilian peers.  Moira Leslie, education manager at RCET, said children from such backgrounds should be considered alongside other groups who face disadvantages when they apply to higher education.  Currently, universities give preferential treatment to pupils from the poorest backgrounds to recognise the impact of poverty on attainment.  Mrs Leslie said: \u0026ldquoNot everyone is affected, but as our survey shows there can be significant disruption to the education of pupils from armed forces families, she said.  \u0026ldquoPupils in this situation can find it difficult to study, particularly if a parent or parents are serving in an active situation or because they are absent.  \u0026ldquoIf pupils have moved between schools they can find it difficult to settle in a new environment and there may be differences in the coursework or teaching they experience.  \u0026ldquoWhere they can also find it difficult is when they have an established group of friends that they have to leave behind and start all over again.  Mrs Leslie said RCET was concerned pupils who would potentially thrive at university were being denied the opportunity.  \u0026ldquoBecause of these experiences they should be encouraged and supported to include that in personal statements when they apply to university.  \u0026ldquoThere should also be a way for universities to identify these applications so they can make allowances.  Five years ago a study of Scottish children who had parents serving in Afghanistan found their levels of stress were particularly high in the build up to their deployment with their worst fears being that their father or mother would be injured or killed.  Academics from City University London, who interviewed more than 50 Scottish pupils, also found they felt apprehensive when their parents were away from home and had difficulty sleeping. Children between the ages of eight and 11 were particularly affected.  The issue was discussed at the Scotland\u0026rsquos Fair Access Conference in Perth, organised by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  The event focused on the mental health and wellbeing of college and university students.  A key theme was how to improve support for the increasing number of students with caring responsibilities.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Higher Education Secretary, said every student should have an equal chance to fulfil their potential.  \u0026ldquoAs well as supporting access to courses, it is essential colleges and universities provide appropriate support for students\u0026rsquo health and wellbeing, she said.  Luke Humberstone, president of student body NUS Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe need to see institutions acknowledging and tackling the barriers that prospective students can face.  Mike Cantlay, chairman of the SFC, said: \u0026ldquoThis important national event will be a catalyst for better understanding and faster progress."},{"url":null,"title":"Councils urged to change their tune on school music fees","story":"              MUSICIANS have held a demonstration in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square to protest over cuts to free tuition in schools across the country.  The impromptu orchestra of professional musicians and students played a funeral march to highlight the ongoing battle to stop councils cutting or charging for tuition.  The protest was also held to publicise a Scottish Parliament petition on the issue which has attracted more than 6,500 signatures.  Eleven local authorities across Scotland have increased their music tuition rates in recent times with some families expected to pay more than \u0026pound500 a year.  East Lothian Council has become the latest to introduce charges with parents now facing annual fees of \u0026pound280. Glasgow does not charge families.  The increasing fees have promoted campaigners to warn that music tuition in schools will become the preserve of the well off in future.  John Wallace, chairman of the Music Education Partnership Group, who conducted the orchestra, said there would be a significant impact on the whole of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are here to highlight the fact that Scottish state schools have a world class system.  \u0026ldquoThere is a great deal of support for the petition from professional musicians because this is the route that we all took and if it slides back any more then we all fear for the future.  \u0026ldquoThis is something that Scotland currently does very well and we have evidence in schools across the land with pupil orchestras, but if we continue down the path of cuts and charges then they become very difficult to run.

Uddingston \u0026amp Bellshill MSP Richard Lyle was accused by a QC of giving \u0026ldquowholly unbelievable testimony in an action against his office worker, Sheena McCulloch.  The claims were made on the bruising final day of a proof at the Court of Session by Kenny McBrearty QC, acting on behalf of former North Lanarkshire SNP councillor Julie McAnulty.  In reply, Roddy Dunlop QC, for Ms McCulloch, accused Ms McAnulty of being heedless of racial sensitivities, and accused her and her key witness of lying in court.  Ms McAnulty is suing Ms McCulloch for alleging she used the word \u0026ldquoPakis in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car in 2015 and saying she wanted Asian members out the local SNP.  Ms McAnulty denies making the remark.  Ms McCulloch, who the court heard had a 2006 conviction for theft, has defended the case on the grounds of accuracy, fair comment and qualified privilege.  She initially said the conversation was in late May 2015, but it later emerged she and Ms McAnulty were in her car on 20 June.  Steven Bonnar, a current SNP councillor in North Lanarkshire, testified he was in the car on that date with the two women, and heard no racist remarks being made.  After four days of evidence in April, the case resumed - and concluded - yesterday.  The court previously heard Ms McAnulty and Ms McCulloch were on rival sides of a \u0026ldquotoxic turf war within the local SNP, with two camps vying for dominance.  Ms McAnulty was allied to former Coatbridge MP Phil Boswell, who wanted reform, while Ms McCulloch was allied to Mr Lyle, whose group wanted to maintain their grip on power.  Ms McCulloch emailed the racism complaint from Mr Lyle\u0026rsquos office on 5 February 2016, and it then leaked to the press.  A Daily Record story three days later led to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos suspension by the SNP.  In his submission to Lord Uist, Mr McBrearty said Mr Lyle, who was not present in court, had been a \u0026ldquobit part player.  However he criticised his evidence, including his attempt to \u0026ldquodissociate himself from the feuding, and his claim he knew nothing about the racism complaint for three days, despite his childhood friend and employee sending it from his office.  He said it was \u0026ldquocompletely implausible that Mr Lyle, who previously denied any \u0026ldquoinput to the complaint, had been unaware of it until it appeared in the Daily Record.  Mr McBrearty said the email was part of a targeted campaign against Ms McAnulty that including two other damaging Daily Record stories about her and race in previous weeks.  He said Ms McCulloch could not credibly explain why she emailed 13 people, only three of whom dealt with party discipline, nor explain why she waited until February.  He called her evidence incredible, untruthful, illogical and absurd.  Mr McBrearty said it would make no sense for Mr Bonnar, who told the court he \u0026ldquoabhors racism, to concoct a story about being in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car to help a racist.  Calling his evidence \u0026ldquostraight-forward and compelling, he asked: \u0026ldquoWhy would Mr Bonnar risk everything in giving evidence in support of someone who has made racist statements?  He said it was very difficult to think Mr Bonnar could be mistaken about being in the car, not least because the day in question was the launch of his successful by-election campaign.  However he said some of Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos witnesses, who said Mr Bonnar may have been in a different car, were understandably mistaken in recalling small events from 2015.  Summing up, he invited Lord Uist to find Ms McAnulty did not make the remark attributed to her, and that Ms McCulloch knew the allegation to be untruthful.  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos actions could not be defended on the basis of accuracy, or veritas or as qualified privilege to interested parties because they had been so widely circulated or as fair comment, as she stated as fact that Ms McAnulty had made racist remarks.  He suggested compensatory damages be set at \u0026pound100,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch intended the complaint to leak to the press, or would have expected it to leak, causing Ms McAnulty greater damage and upset, or at around \u0026pound40,000 otherwise.  In his submission, Mr Dunlop attacked Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos evidence, saying problems with in it cast doubt on her whole case.  He said that at an SNP meeting in 2012 she was \u0026ldquoheedless of racial sensitivities by questioning whether a senior Asian member, Dr Imtiaz Majid, later an SNP councillor, directed the votes of other Asian members.  He said Ms McAnulty was also prepared to \u0026ldquosully the reputation of other witnesses by accusing them of perjury, fabrication and attempting to pervert the course of justice.  He said her \u0026ldquodemonstrable mendacity\u0026hellip taints her evidence irretrievably.  He said there was a \u0026ldquovery clear lack of motive for Ms McCulloch to act as Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopolitical assassin, given the two women barely knew each other, other than a \u0026ldquofanciful theory about helping Mr Lyle\u0026rsquos re-election to Holyrood in 2016.  He also said Mr Bonnar had been \u0026ldquolying about being in the car, and that there had been no room in it for him as the back seat was full of campaign materials, and that his evidence conflicted with there being child locks on the back door.  He said it was \u0026ldquoremarkable he had waited \u0026ldquomonths after the Daily Record story about the racism complaint to tell SNP HQ that he had been in the vehicle.  He said the evidence demonstrated convincingly that Mr Bonnar had not been in the car, and that was \u0026ldquofatal to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos case. He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos evidence had been \u0026ldquocredible and \u0026ldquoreliable, and it made no sense for her to concoct a lie about a talk in a car if Mr Bonnar had been there too and could simply contradict her.  Mr McBrearty said that assumed Ms McCulloch was a \u0026ldquogood liar, not a bad one.  He also rejected Mr Dunlop\u0026rsquos assertion that Ms McAnulty made a racist remark in 2012, merely an ambiguous one, and denied she lied under oath in court.  On the subject of damages, Mr Dunlop suggested that Ms McAnulty had so reduced her own reputation in court, that if even she won she would deserve only \u0026ldquonominal damages of \u0026pound1.  Otherwise damages should be limited to \u0026pound30,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch was responsible for her email reaching the media, or to \u0026pound5000 if he did not.  Lord Uist, who said he now had \u0026ldquoa great deal to read about and to write, is expected to give his judgment in two to three months\u0026rsquo time."}]
