It will then be a drier and brighter day with spells of sunshine.The unsettled weather will return on Thursday with outbreaks of rain spreading eastwards during the day before turning heavy and persistent. Friday will bring another wet day with thick cloud cover and spells of rain which will be heavy and persistent in the south.Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: \u0027We are about to see a big change, and after the milder weather we have seen through September, autumn is about to break down the door.\u0027Low pressure from the Atlantic will move in next week with plummeting overnight temperatures next week bringing a small chance of frost to the highlands of Scotland.\u0027We are watching out for fireworks in October which threatens a particularly active season of storms and ex-hurricanes coming in from the Atlantic.\u0027Mr Dale added: \u0027I would expect a pattern of stormier weather to start revving up in October.\u0027The jet stream is about to move south and this will bring more of an influence form the northern Atlantic.\u0027Summer ended with a soft landing thanks to an extended mild weather in September, but October threatens a very different scenario.  \u0027This is something to keep our eyes on and it is a case of watch this space.\u0027As the weekend approaches, periods of heavy rain are expected in northwestern areas, with gale force winds in the far north at times. "},{"url":null,"title":"UK control Go Aheads Southeastern rail franchise","story":"Share this article\u0027We need the Government to dump the failed franchise system, end the profiteering of the train operating companies and take over the whole thing, lock stock and rails. \u0027It\u0027s a total scandal that Govia is now being investigated by the serious fraud office over millions of pounds of public money and yet they are still running Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) - the government must immediately bring GTR services into public ownership.\u0027Taxpayers must be reassured that public money is not being squandered and that they have zero tolerance of fraud.\u0027It comes after the Government in May unveiled long-awaited reforms of the country\u0027s fragmented railway network, including a new centralised price and reservations system.By launching a new public body, Great British Railways, whose name has echoes of nationalised British Rail in the previous century, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s government has already begun to take greater control of the sector.But it insists that the new route taken is not equivalent to renationalisation of the railways - a sector that continues to be hit hard by the pandemic depressing passenger numbers.Britain\u0027s rail tracks are already in state hands but the trains are run by mostly private companies enjoying large government subsidies.And since privatisation of the sector in the mid-1990s, the taxpayer has been forced to take control of financially-struggling franchises.Should the government eventually hand the running of Southeastern back to a private company, it will meanwhile not be under the franchise system, which was scrapped a year ago for new contracts.Private rail operators are still paid management fees for running services but now face tougher scrutiny and greater state involvement. "},{"url":null,"title":"EU truckers say UK government needs offer LONGER work permits","story":"Share this articleShare this article Under an emergency government plan, key workers could be given \u0027priority access\u0027 to a number of petrol stations.

Photograph: iStockI returned to school this year after 13 years on a career breaksecondment combination. It’s been a bit of an adjustment, getting back into the swing of things. I had been working in education but very much removed from the day-to-day workings of a school.I’m a primary teacher and my school, located within walking distance of Dublin city centre, is well on the way to being double-streamed. So, as primary schools go, it’s veering towards the larger end of the spectrum, and what struck me on September 1st in a very obvious and dumb kind of way was how many children there were.So many children.And the thing is, hundreds of children moving around a building, chatting, laughing and larking about, can make an awful lot of noise. For someone used to sitting at a kitchen table for the past year and a half, all those acoustics bouncing off your standard school walls has been quite the revelation.And of course there’s the energy. So much energy. I was on duty in the junior, surfaced yard at one stage and watched in awe as the kids ran and leapt and bounced and rolled and performed the most joyous cartwheels right there on the astroturf.As a middle-aged woman wandering around this explosion of activity, it was as if the cycle of life was playing out in front of me. I couldn’t help thinking that if the school could somehow harness this energy, electricity bills would be a thing of the past.Of course, yard duty offers a window into pupil dynamics as well as an occasional insight into school life from the pupils’ perspective.PragmatismIn my previous incarnation all those years ago, I would marvel at the pragmatism of iniduals who would approach the supervising teacher with a specific endeavour in mind: to take out a football and wallop it from one end of the yard to another to initiate a hanging-upside-down competition from a nearby fence to scale the perimeter wall.And when they failed to receive the hoped-for response, I’d watch as they’d scan the yard for adult number two and, undeterred, head over in that direction, determined to inveigle someone into giving the go-ahead.An interaction that made a real impression at the time was when two boys from first or second got involved in some kind of altercation. The perceived victim was very much aggrieved. He wanted retribution. As far as he was concerned, the powers of the institution needed to be brought to bear.But the perpetrator wasn’t for budging. Nothing untoward had happened in his mind. It was all a big misunderstanding. His brother from an older class materialised on the scene. “Just say sorry,” I heard him advise matter-of-factly, when my back was turned. “Just say sorry and then it’s all over. They forget about it.”I’m pretty sure I audibly gasped because of course – of course – he was right. I didn’t want the hassle of relaying the whole, convoluted incident to the class teacher and I absolutely wanted to avoid any kind of paperwork.BrilliantBut then children can be brilliant at reading a situation. And this kicks in from day one.The junior infants who bravely set foot in the classroom in the first week of term were very much aware that this was a big deal. They mightn’t have been quite au fait with the fact that they had just entered a system that would entail another 13-14 years of their lives, but at some level they knew that a rite of passage had taken place.And as for the staff?I’d forgotten how much a school resembles that swan or duck calmly and nonchalantly negotiating the water with no outward sign of the manoeuvrings underneath.There were meetings and more meetings with much to discuss: policies processes planning templates budgets assessments books supplies. With the spectre of Covid present, ever present: doors and windows open distinctions made between medical and cloth masks X marking the seating areas in the staff room cloths and sanitisers and staggered breaks.It’s a lot to take in, with reports of confirmed cases in other schools already beginning to filter through.It’s the most boring and cliched of mantras, but taking it one day at a time is probably the only way to go. And from my point of view, that has to apply to everything else as well."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The climate activist has spent three years raising the alarm.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Getty ImagesTeachers should get proposed Covid-19 bonus payments for frontline workers because of their “extraordinary efforts” during the pandemic, teaching unions have declared.The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI), Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) and the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) came together in a joint statement to demand the extra money.While there have been no formal discussions, the three said the contribution to remote teaching and keeping schools open has been of crucial importance in meeting young people’s needs.“We would expect to be included in any discussions around the acknowledgement of workers’ contributions during the pandemic,” they said, though no formal talks have taken place with the Government.“Teachers’ extraordinary efforts – both face-to-face with their pupils in crowded classrooms and in the online learning space – have allowed schools to continue to prioritise teaching and learning while meeting childrenyoung people’s needs,” they said.UnequalTUI general secretary Michael Gillespie suggested that one option could include “getting rid of unequal payscales”, which has seen teachers hired since 2011 earn less than older colleagues.Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath has warned that the bonus could cost €1 billion, while the bid by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and other health unions for 10 days’ extra leave brings “significant costs”.Meanwhile, gardaí have equally insisted that they should receive bonus payments, partly arguing that the drop in crime that took place during the pandemic because people were not out is not a reason to leave them out.The Garda Representative Association (GRA) and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (Agsi) have so far not raised the issue in talks with the Government.ProudHowever, a GRA source said gardaí should receive “no more and no less” than other State workers, adding that the fact that most forms of crime dropped significantly during the pandemic is a reason for gardaí to be proud.Meanwhile, domestic violence increased, while gardaí had to deal with a raft of new, speedily introduced laws, the GRA source told The , speaking anonymously.“The fact that crime figures are down is something for gardaí to be proud of. And certainly, there have been other issues regarding the rise in domestic violence because of the pandemic,” he said.Gardaí had to adapt to 12-hour rosters during the pandemic, which cut overtime . The roster is coming to an end shortly and gardaí are eager to get certainty on what will replace it, he added.An Agsi source rejected any claims that gardaí had less work to do during Covid-19 due to the drop in crime, pointing to the efforts made for vulnerable people and at checkpoints “at considerable risk to themselves at times”.Meanwhile, drugs and organised crime operations continued unabated, with unprecedented seizures. “Those people were happy to do it,” they said. “No one is looking for special treatment.

Photograph: Alan BetsonIf all the proposed data centres for Ireland were to be connected they could use as much as 70 per cent of Ireland’s electricity grid capacity in 2030, according to a leading academic in this area. Dr Patrick Bresnihan of National University of Ireland, Maynooth, will tell the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Climate Change that while data centres currently represented 11 per cent of grid capacity, the energy used by those existing connections will rise to almost 30 per cent of overall capacity by the end of the decade. If all other data centres proposed for Ireland are allowed, their energy use would comprise 70 per cent of capacity on the national grid. This compares with the worldwide situation where only 2 per cent of electricity is consumed by data centres. In his opening statement to the committee , Dr Bresnihan raises concerns about the continued expansion of this sector on a number of grounds. “Data centres are currently responsible for 1.58 per cent of Ireland’s carbon emissions,” according to the opening statement. A lecturer in the university’s geography department, Dr Bresnihan also says that while Ireland has committed to having 70 per cent of its electricity sourced from renewables (mainly wind) by 2030, there will be a need, especially in the short term, for other sources of energy, which is likely to be natural gas. “Achieving ambitious emissions and renewable targets by 2030 will undoubtedly be far more difficult with the addition of more data centres to the grid,” he has stated. He said that an average data centre used as much electricity as a small city like Kilkenny. He also said that an average centre was also a large consumer of water, using an estimated 500,000 litres per day. Dr Bresnihan said that Singapore had become the first country in the world to introduce a moratorium on data centres. It has said it will only lift the moratorium when renewable energy capacity has been increased plus data storage technologies have been sufficiently developed to reduce the energy burden. “From these figures it is evident that Ireland shoulders more than a fair share of the energy and water burden of global digital activities… In a context where households are facing increased energy bills and carbon taxes, the continued granting of planning permission to energy-intensive data centres is already being perceived as unfair,” he has said. In a separate submission Professor James Carton of Dublin City University makes the case for a marked increase of the use of hydrogen as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. He says DCU has modelled for the storage needed for 100 per cent renewable energy and said it concluded it was beyond the capacity of batteries, but within that of hydrogen. “Many EU countries and countries worldwide are beginning to embrace hydrogen, rolling out heavy transport, co-firing gas turbines, decarbonising industries, developing ships to move it by sea, developing platforms to produce on offshore wind turbines while also preparing the groundwork for long-term energy storage. “Ireland must follow this lead produce green hydrogen at a useful scale to deploy it in suitable mature applications such as heavy transport, industry, and data centre power generation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blame haulage industry not brexit fuel shortage says tory mp","story":"Fewer than 10,000 European lorry drivers left the UK workforce after Brexit, official statistics have revealed, despite claims Brexit is to blame for the crisis.Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that only one in five drivers to have left the profession since the referendum were EU nationals.Meanwhile, it has emerged that the haulage industry was warned as far back as 2016 that it faced a shortage of as many as 100,000 drivers as it struggled to attract new truckers to replace those retiring or leaving the industry.It comes as Michel Barnier, the former EU chief negotiator, and the Labour Party have this week sought to pin the crisis on Brexit, arguing that there is a “clear link” between the driver shortage and the UK’s decision to leave the bloc.It is estimated the UK currently needs an additional 100,000 drivers to secure its supply lines. Before the pandemic the haulage industry was short by around 60,000, a figure which has since been exacerbated as around 30,000 more vacancies were created over the last year.However, on Tuesday, Huw Merriman, the chairman of the Transport Committee, pushed back on the characterisation that Brexit is to blame and said the haulage industry had ignored the growing driver shortage for years.The Conservative MP pointed to a 2016 parliamentary report into the looming crisis that warned of driver shortages unless wages and conditions improved.The ongoing shortage erupted into a national crisis last week when news leaked that BP was warning the Government that fuel stocks in its forecourts were lower than normal due to the lack of drivers.The leak sparked panic-buying at petrol stations with drivers queuing for hours to fill up over the weekend and ministers putting the army on standby to help with fuel deliveries.On Monday, Mr Barnier argued that the fuel crisis was a “direct consequence” of the UK leaving the union.Speaking at an event at the London School of Economics to promote his new book, he said: “Part of the answer is linked, effectively, to the consequences of Brexit because the UK chose to end freedom of movement. And there is a clear link to the truck drivers.”His comments were echoed by Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, who said that Brexit was “obviously a contributory factor” to the HGV driver shortage, adding “to deny that I think flies in the face of reality”.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, downplayed suggestions on Tuesday that Brexit had been a big factor in the crisis and said the mass cancellations of HGV driver tests during the pandemic had had a far more direct impact.Figures from the Office of National Statistics, show that of the 46,000 drivers who left the haulage industry between 2016 and 2020,  only 9,000 - 19 per cent - were EU nationals.National statistics also show the percentage of EU drivers in the UK workforce has remained steady since Brexit.In 2016, EU drivers accounted for 37,000, or just 11 per cent, of the 321,000 lorry drivers in the UK. By 2021 that had marginally decreased to 10 per cent, with them now making 28,000 of the total 275,000 drivers.While the proportion of EU drivers has remained steady since Brexit, the average age of HGV drivers has been rising as more younger truckers leave the profession.ONS figures showed that in 2013, 45 per cent of drivers were over 50, but by 2020 that demographic represented more than half, 54 percent, of all truckers.Conversely, drivers aged between 35- to 49-years-old, those who could reasonably expect to spend another 10 to 20 years in the industry, shrank sharply, dwindling from 40 per cent of the overall workforce in 2013 to 29 per cent in 2020.ONS stats also show that average HGV driver pay has not kept pace with inflation since 2010.Meanwhile, figures from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) showed that fewer and fewer young people are now applying for licences.In 2013, under 29s accounted for 45 per cent of those taking their HGV licences, but by 2021 that had plummeted to just 35 per cent.On Tuesday, Mr Merriman, who voted to remain in the referendum, publicly pushed back on the idea that Brexit had caused the driver shortage, saying blame lies with the haulage industry not addressing the steady haemorrhage of drivers.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme, he said: “This is a private industry, I remember back in 2016 asking them what they were going to do to fix their industry, why is it that only one per cent of all drivers are women, why is it that only two per cent of all drivers are under 25, why is the average age 55?“Let’s now hear from the industry about what they’re going to do to get their own industry in order rather than just constantly asking the Government to step in.”The backbencher pointed to a 2016 report by the Transport select committee, in which the road haulage industry said it was already facing a shortage of 60,000 drivers, with another 40,000 due to leave in 2017.At the time, MPs called on the industry to overhaul pay and conditions as well as roadside facilities for drivers to attract more people into the profession.More from NewsPM promises families Covid inquiry chairman by ChristmasAnger on campuses as freshers given wristbands to signify Covid vaccinationClubber can \u0026#39only identify the year, not the date\u0026#39 she saw Prince Andrew dancing with accuserTony Blair’s former fundraiser accused of failing to pay £2 million to his Austrian princess ex-wifeReadmit Jeremy Corbyn as Labour MP to unite party, Sir Keir Starmer toldM25 protesters vow to continue blocking roads despite threat of jailMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron has waved flag gastronomic surrender","story":"No, it was poor, beleaguered President Macron. He was in Lyon and, with an eye on next year’s presidential election, was addressing the International Catering, Hotel and Food Trade Fair. Macron wants to galvanise chefs and others in the French hospitality industry, to make them feel proprietorial and patriotic about French cuisine, and in doing so win some votes.But beneath the rhetoric has Macron admitted something that many have long suspected? By announcing the creation of a new epicurean “centre of excellence” is he not letting slip a fact that terrifies so many in France – namely that their country is no longer the culinary champion of the world?After all, if a nation is truly great at something, it hardly needs to launch an academy to teach people how to do it. Macron’s speech was the white flag of gastronomic surrender, an admission that France’s chefs, ingredients, traditions and tastes have been overtaken.This defeat has been a long time coming. Over the past few decades, the country’s food traditions have been attacked and usurped on all sides. There’s been the advance in interest in all things Asian – think China, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, India.It is from this huge region that young cheffing talent gets much inspiration and ingredients far from putting jus, confits or cream sauces on their menus, the buzz has been for dumplings, spices, kimchi, wasabi, and fermented pastes such as gochujang or sashimi.Then there is the invasive beast of the supermarket. Pity the poor provincial French market trader selling his local and seasonal produce in the centre of a little town knowing that there’s a Lidl or Aldi offering ample parking, 24-hour convenience and pizza a couple of miles away. Not to mention the fact that even French supermarkets such as Carrefour and Monoprix these days offer a shopping experience that is more American than traditionally Gallic.Traditional France has also been left behind in some of the seismic food trends of recent years. As anyone who has ever visited an iconic French restaurant will know, vegetables are featured only as a decorative excuse on the plate a tiny slice of carrot at the outer reaches of your hare à la Royale. The plant-based revolution has left that for dust … and when the Bordeaux-based vegan restaurant ONA won a Michelin star earlier this year you could almost hear the sacré bleu uttered by the French culinary establishment.Since the 1970s, food has been democratised. Eating out is an everyday habit. And across the Channel the Brits have made a virtue of this: London, for example, has a far greater variety of cuisine at all prices than Paris – and that appeals to the modern diner.Macron’s attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted may be valiant – but he may yet find that the French culinary establishment don’t want him to “apprendre à un vieux singe à faire des grimaces”,as they’d say in a bouchon in Lyon.More from NewsPM promises families Covid inquiry chairman by ChristmasAnger on campuses as freshers given wristbands to signify Covid vaccinationClubber can \u0026#39only identify the year, not the date\u0026#39 she saw Prince Andrew dancing with accuserTony Blair’s former fundraiser accused of failing to pay £2 million to his Austrian princess ex-wifeReadmit Jeremy Corbyn as Labour MP to unite party, Sir Keir Starmer toldM25 protesters vow to continue blocking roads despite threat of jailMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayners four letter word","story":":root Angela Rayners four-letter word spelled anger, and Im glad shes not sorryThe honesty shown by Labours deputy leader impressed me enough to join the party, says Polly HudsonAngela Rayner simply tells it like it is Image: GettyopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Sep | comments So many words have been spoken, and written, about Angela Rayneraposs comment on the Tory party. When I heard what she’d said, my reaction was summed up in just one. FINALLY. And her words spurred me into action – I joined the Labour Party.Angela’s observations weren’t what we’re used to in the slick, rehearsed world of politics today. They were raw. Real. Honest. At last, someone voiced the fiery fury and outrage I’ve been feeling for so long. Somebody brimming with passion, and anger, at the way people in this country have been – are being – treated. At the injustice, the cruelty, the corruption. At the cuts that will only hurt those who need the most help. Do you agree  Join the discussion in the comment section  At the shambolic incompetence that cost needless lives at the height of the pandemic, and has plunged Britain into chaos this week, today, right at this very second. And the way none of it seems to make any dference, because they get away with it over and over again. Much has been made about Angela’s use of the word ‘“scum” but we’re talking about a party that had to be shamed into feeding hungry children by a footballer. The cap is a perfect fit.The only thing I loved more than what Angela said  Her refusal to apologise for it. At a time when cancel culture rules all, when people fall over themselves to say sorry, out of fear for the personal consequences rather than genuinely being sorry, how refreshing that someone – especially a woman – says nope, I meant that.Get all the latest news straight to your inbox. to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Her statement has proved unpopular with many, but she’s standing by it, with her head held high. I find that inspiring. Amidst all the criticism, Angela tweeted a few of the many examples of completely unacceptable things the PM has said. “People seem to be far more concerned with my choice of language than the fact Boris Johnson has made comments that are racist, homophobic and sexist,” she wrote. “I’m very happy to sit down with Boris. If he withdraws his comments and apologises, I’ll be very happy to apologise to him.” This is exactly the chutzpah I want my Labour Party to have. Precisely what I want them to be doing: standing up to the bullies.Angela Rayner isn’t perfect, but she’s open, direct and honest... coincidentally, the exact opposite adjectives you’d use to describe Boris Johnson.Her energy reminded me of that famous speech from  film Network, where the incensed news broadcaster tells viewers, “I want you to get up right now. Sit up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick your head out and yell – ‘I’m as mad as hell and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’ Things have got to change. But first, you’ve gotta get mad! You’ve got to say, ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’ Then we’ll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first, get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: ‘I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not gonna take this anymore!’” Angela Rayner is mad as hell and she’s not going to take this any more.

Labour has slammed Health Secretary Sajid Javidaposs mixed messages on Covid passports.Deputy leader Angela Rayner said: The government’s approach to Covid passports has been shambolic from the start. There has never been any clarity from ministers about what vaccine passports were supposed to achieve, how they would work and what was expected from businesses and workers. Health Minister Maggie Throup said: “Our Autumn and Winter plan puts us on a sure footing and gives the whole country the best possible chance of living with COVID- in the months ahead, without the need for unwanted social and economic restrictions. “The vaccine programme has tilted the odds in our favour in our shared fight against this virus and while we are totally confident the careful steps we are taking will help rule out the need for mandatory vaccine certicates, we need to be prepared for all scenarios.  Brits have already been braced for a dficult winter as respiratory viruses including Covid and the flu thrive in the cold seasons. Even though more than  million adults have had both of their Covid jabs, which counts for % of over-s, people are still at risk of catching the virus and transmitting it.

John McDonnell accused the Labour leader of breaking his promises to the members as the partyaposs annual conference descended into infighting.Former leader Jeremy Corbyn also lashed out at his successor who he accused of seeking to prop up those with wealth and power.Labouraposs civil war was reignited on Monday when Mr McDonald dramatically quit as Shadow Employment Rights Secretary in a row over the minimum wage. He claimed Mr Starmer had told him to block a £ minimum wage and said the leader had not honoured “our commitment to socialist policies” One of the last survivors of the Corbyn era in the shadow cabinet, Mr McDonaldaposs departure stoked acrimony and caused tensions to spill into the open. On Tuesday, Mr McDonnell lashed out at Mr Starmer for going back on pledges during his Labour leadership campaign.AskedMr Starmer was trying to move in a completely dferent direction without him, Mr McDonnell told Sky News: “If he does, I wish he’d told us that when he stood for leader” “When he stood for leader there were two basic promises - one, ‘I will unite the party’. “When he was talking about uniting the party he talked about more member engagement, not less. “The second, he put out a -point policy plan which was largely based upon the last two manestos, and that’s how he got elected leader.” He said he had “tried to” support Mr Starmer but “some of us had to speak out” over factional changes at conference. Mr Corbyn told the Mirror that Mr Starmer should stick to his commitments during a fringe event. He said: I read the  points that he put forward for the leadership and I think when you put forward something you should try and stick to it as a policy thing. But I donapost want to get involved in some personal spat with people. I want to see a dferent society, a better world and a Labour movement that can deliver that by inspiring people. The former leader insisted that Mr McDonaldaposs departure was not a plot - after some critics accused him of trying to derail the conference. Shadow Scotland Secretary Ian Murray had branded the move deliberate sabotage, saying Mr McDonald had signed off Labouraposs policy of at least a £ minimum himself. Mr Corbyn said he had series of private conversations with Mr McDonald, who is a close friend. Andy worked very closely with us in the shadow cabinet and he took what was for him a personal and very dficult and very principled decision, he said. If it had been a deep-laid Machiavellian plot to announce a resignation on a particular afternoon in Brighton, it wouldaposve leaked out weeks ago. Mr Corbyn, who lost the Labour whip in a row over anti-Semitism last year, said he believed he should be admitted back into the parliamentary party after having his membership restored. He said: I don’t think the Parliamentary Labour Party should try to gainsay what the National Executive has decided so as far as I am concerned there is no case other than I should be reinstated on the Labour whip. It comes as Mr Corbyn called on the Labour party to have a sense of humanity and self-criticism on the part they played in wars in the past. Speaking at a Labour Conference fringe event on aposHow can we end  years of the war on terror , he said:We need to look to the future where we have a foreign policy and international justice strategy based on peace or justice, on human rights and respect for people and deal with the real issues of this planet. Which are global poverty inequality, as COVID is showing us and of course, the threats of environmental destruction and climate change, that has to be the right way forward. Yesterday Mr Corbyn accused Mr Starmer of failing to challenge the wealthy and the powerful. Writing in the i newspaper, he said: So far this week, Labour’s leaders have shown they want to prop up, not challenge that wealth and power. There is another way forward, that is based on social justice, and in the policies the majority of people actually want, not what the establishment and its media mouthpieces insist they should want.

Yet in Brighton his potential successors are strutting their stuff for the moment, whenever it comes, he joins Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Milliband in the socialist Valhalla for fallen opposition leaders. Keep your friends close and a closer eye on your potential rivals is smart politics. And after an eventful few days at the seaside, Keir Starmer may need one eye open. Weaposre reviewing the form of runners in an unofficial beauty race.  Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester Mayor The King of the North swaggered into town making no secret of his hope to also rule Englandaposs South, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland too. He has the aura of a man with a little power whoaposd like more and as popular on the fringe as well as dominating a four-way conversation on the main stage after complaining that denying him a prime time solo slot was Labour cancel culture. Needs to be an MP to run. Rochdale  Marked down half a point for failing to mask naked ambition.

Urging Labour to cut the “London bashing” to win votes in the North smacked of a dig at rival Andy “Madchester” Burnham. Like Burnham, heaposd also need to be re-elected an MP to run. Must pick up speed to be a serious contender. Score:   Lisa Nandy, Shadow Foreign Secretary The Wigan warrior didnapost sparkle as brightly as previous conferences and her call for Britain to build bridges with nations in Europe and the rest of the world could also apply to her and the party when she finished a disappointing third behind Starmer and Rebecca Long Bailey in last yearaposs Labour bun fight.

Richard Burgon, Socialist Campaign Group secretary Starmer changing Labour leadership rules was specically intended to block Corbynite mini-mes like the Leeds East MP from standing never mind winning.

Score:   Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Seized her moment in the spotlight as chief bean counter with an animated speech hailed bysketch writer John Crace as less wooden than past performances, an assessment that is glowing praise indeed from the chief grump. Reeves is backtracking to the fiscal prudence of Gordon Brown after the radicalism of John McDonnell and looks and sounds confident in her brief. How she does against Rishi Sunak will determine her fate. Score: .  Wes Streeting, Shadow Secretary for Child Poverty The free school meals kids from a council flat in Londonaposs Stepney earned rave reviews on the Brighton fringe with a string of electrying appearances.

Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Sep | commentsSadiq Khan has spoken movingly about needing round the clock police protection because of “the colour of his skin and the god he worships.” The London Mayor said he was given the confidence to talk about the threats and vitriol he receives for the first time after seeing the response to Marcus Rashford and the England team speaking out about racism.Speaking at Labour Party Conference, he revealed he rejected a police protection detail when he was first elected Mayor of London, because he likes using the tube and walking around in the capital.But the “game changer”, he said, was when officers told his we and chief of staff that his family and members of staff would be at riskhe didn’t accept the -strong politan Police detail who protects him day or night. “You can’t do anything spontaneously, for obvious reasons.” he told a fringe event hosted by the New Statesman magazine. “Riding a bike to work, which is something I do often, is dferent for me than it would be for you. Using the tube, which I do is dferent for me than it is for you. “Walking my dog in the park is dferent for me than it is for you. “ He said going for a jog was also dficult, but that he always beats his security detail when he goes running.  He added: ”Itaposs hard. Itaposs really hard. Itaposs hard for my family. Having snfer dogs in your house is not fun. Not being able to answer the door is not great. Itaposs not fun. Itaposs hard. “And my staff - I have the best staff in the world - but to have to give your staff counselling because of the vitriol directed at me that theyaposve got to read from letters, emails, itaposs horrible. Itaposs tough.” He went on: The game changer for me was when the police spoke to my chief of staff and my we to try and persuade me to accept. And the point they made was I may reject it, but do I realise that because of me, those who are with me may be at risk - whether itaposs my we and kids, or whether itaposs my staff who I work with. And that was the reason why I said yes in the end, because Iaposve got a duty of care to my staff. I love my family, I love my staff too by the way.  He said it was “upsetting” to be criticised in the media for driving to a park, on police advice, to walk his dog. But he has hesitated to speak out about the abuse and threats he and his team receive, because he fears it might prevent other people of colour standing for office. “Imagine being my we or my daughters or my mum. Itaposs not nice,” he said. “And me saying it comes with the package is discouraging someone running to be the mayor. So I donapost talk about it....itaposs probably the first time Iaposve talked about it. I might get emotional.” The London Mayor said he had been given the confidence to speak out. by England’s football team speaking out against racism in the Euro  tournament. “The way Marcus Rashford, Sancho, Saka, have talked about it, and the response theyaposve received has given me so much hope. “And itaposs given me confidence to talk about it myself, not because Iaposm playing the victim card or the race card or the muslim card, but because people need to know.” He added: “Iaposm not going to allow these racists and these Islamophobes to intimidate me, and Iaposll never bow to them. “The mayor of the greatest city in the world needs protection  hours a day seven days a week because of the colour of his skin and the god he worships.

It will be written by a committee, it will have taken them months, and whole chunks will have been negotiated with dferent bits of the Labour machine. Which is why it will be as inspiring as a cup of cold sick on a drizzly day in Newport Pagnell.  Trans rights are human rights. We must build back better than the Tories destroyed. And all the ways I am not Boris Johnson, the principle one of which is that I am incapable of projecting my personality more than about six centimetres. Johnson has projected his personality across the globe. Itaposs vile, self-serving, childish, and slapdash, but basic herd behaviour makes it more interesting than someone who is thoughtful, clever, principled and careful. We all know the latter makes a better person. But we also know that leaders first have to get your attention, then keep it. Gaining your respect is a bonus, and few manage that. Labour was a party founded from movements against what was wrong. It is good at realising what is wrong, and coming up with some pretty innovative solutions. It listens, and dreams of what could be. The Conservatives, by comparison, were founded on a wish to maintain what is. It is bred in the bone to say this is working great for us, letaposs not change. Labour picks at scabs the Tories plaster over them. Labour criticises its own victories, its greatest leader, its factions multiply like mould on sweaty cheese. The Tories spend zero time on the leaders of its past. They do not wonder about Mrs Thatcher, or argue about whether Iain Duncan Smith is a human being or an angry squirrel.  They just say: We were in power, great! They ignore the times and reasons they werenapost. Labour picks the fluff from its navel, gives it a good snf, rolls it between its fingers, wonders what it is, considers showing it to other people and asking them what they think. Itaposs more likely to get sectioned than elected. Starmer should sit down with a pen and notepad and write his own speech. He has a good character and a personality that is informed, principled, and charismatic, but he has not been able to project it in a pandemic where all human interaction has boiled down to a two-dimensional computer screen. Sit with him at a table and youaposd be impressed but he has to relax more in interviews so that he can do the same when heaposs projected into millions of living rooms and car shares. Read more Whereas two dimensions rather suit Johnson, whose personality is galactic in its ambitions and whose character has not altered since he was a bawling infant demanding bitty. While he dodges his fuel crisis, the North and his own ethics commissioner, Keir has to capitalise on a cautiously reopening Britain, talk to those queuing for hours to get to the forecourts so they can work, show how he can make our lives and work valued and valuable, and do it without sleaze or scandal. He could promise to redecorate the Downing Street flat with help from Wilko, like the rest of us. So the speech has to say: I am Keir Starmer. This is me. I know you, and what you want, and hereaposs how Iaposll do it. It should not mention Johnson, who is an attention black hole, gobbling up bandwidth. It should not mention Blair, Corbyn, or anything from the past. And for the love of Pete, stay away from cervixes. Starmer is benighted by a party that canapost agree, and a machinery that grinds up true leadership and spits out a grudge-filled coalition. Heaposs tinkered with the rules, but also needs to strip out every unnecessary cog and spanner from the works. A leader has to be an autocrat. And he has to emote, project, use facial expressions. The camera loves it, because people connect with it. Until he shows us his loves and hates, his dream to replace Johnsonaposs lumbering, never-ending nightmare, heaposll only ever be a caretaker, the man keeping it ticking over until a new boss comes along. Heaposs been working on fighting an election in two years time. It could be called within months, by a maverick with a taste for risk and unerring knack for self-preservation. Starmeraposs speech has to say he knows what heaposs up against, heaposs ready now, and not only tell them itaposs time to fall in line - but to give them a faith in his abilities that means they want to march with him.

The Times shared a photograph of Rayner having a cigarette during a break in an article about Keir Starmer not backing up her “scum” comments. The Daily Mail dedicated an entire article to Rayner having a “crafty cigarette”. Of course, it isn’t unusual for the public to make attempts to discredit a working-class woman in this way. Open up Twitter and you’ll see post upon post about how Rayner isn’t “classy”, or compared with other Conservative female MPs she’s “tacky” or like “chalk and cheese”. Even the Twitter account for Leave.EU tweeted that Rayner had no “class”. All ignoring the fact that Conservative MP James Gray admitted he made a joke about delivering a bomb to the office of Labour chair Anneliese Dodds.  But I digress — as we’ve all come to learn, working-class womenare judged to a much higher standard than others. When they can’t attack their brains, people will go for the superficial. Like hair extensions , smoking, accents, semantics.They do this all while distracting from or ignoring the serious issues plaguing the working-class communities in our country. Universal Credit cuts, soaring energy prices… who cares about that when Angela Rayner called the people responsible for those things “scum”  You only have to look at the Daily Mail article that dedicated itself to Rayner’s smoking habit and calling senior Tories “aposracist, homophobic, scum”. In the same piece, a couple of paragraphs in, it was quoted that a government official said that Rayner was “talking crap”. Why is that exempt from criticism but Rayner’s comments aren’t  Why is Rayner’s “class” being called into question when someone ’s isn’t  Why can Boris Johnson make comments about single parents and hijabs or Sajid Javid make transphobic remarks, but Rayner can’t call someone “scum”   It’s called the patriarchy and its ever-present double standards. But obviously, people don’t stop there. Rather than put Rayner’s comments down to her being from the working-class — she worked as a carer before becoming an MP — they put it down to “her strategy” to appeal to the working-class. Because apparently, all the working-class care about is calling Tory officials scum and whether or Rayner takes a cigarette break or not and whether she looks tacky doing so . Rayner’s comments, her appearance and her mass appeal have everything to do with her authenticity and her bravery to call out officials like Johnson, Dominic Raaband other senior leaders. It’s to do with her empathy for the working-class — her working-class.

Teaming up with ex-burglars and unfortunate victims of theft, Safe ’s experts have used their experiences to provide expert advice on how to stop your home from being targeted – as well as what to doyou do fall victim to a burglary.Buy exterior lights One of the easiest ways to protect your house from burglars is to install outdoor security lights that are triggered by motion.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. An ex-burglar said: “I’d always skip the house with big outdoor security lights.” And Anthony Neary, managing director for Safe, further explained: “Turn on all exterior lights at night where possible. “A house in the dark could appeal to a burglar as it looks like nobody is in the property, and there could be an assumption that the owner is asleep or not at home. “Any dark or shadowed areas are ideal for a burglar to try to approach the house undetected, making security lights essential in the new season.” Get a pet According to one homeowner, there’s only one reason their house hasn’t been touched by thieves, while others on the road have been targeted – they have a Dachshund and a “Beware of the Dog” sign on their fence. Experts say having a family dog could be a huge deterrent for robbers, as they’re more likely to be caughtthe pooch barks at them. They said: “Having a dog is useful for two reasons. Firstly, burglars may be inclined to miss a propertythey see a ‘Beware Of The Dog’ sign as a big dog threatens their safety and adds a huge risk of being caught.  “Secondly, a barking dog alerts the owners that someone is approaching the property, they detect noise quicker than humans, which gives a clear advantage.” Be careful when going away Burglars often target housesthey notice the owners haven’t been home for a while – and one victim explained they were targeted when thieves spotted them loading their car for a skiing trip. To combat this, experts suggest taking luggage to your car or taxi “swtly” so that any lurking burglars have less chance of seeing you leave the property.  Ask for help from a neighbour When you do go away for an extended period of time, experts say it’s always a good idea to ask a neighbour or a friend to visit your home every few days to make sure there are no signs of the property being vacant. A Safe expert said: “Burglars can tella family has gone on holiday. From full letterboxes, to forgotten milk deliveries and left out wheely bins, the signs show that the property is vacant. “If you are going away for an extended period of time, ask a trusted neighbour or friend to maintain any elements that could be an advertisement for burglars.” Beware of repeat offenders If your house has been robbed before, an ex-burglar has claimed you’re actually more likely to be targeted again. They said: “Burglars come back to the same houses quite often. They do this because of a number of motives. “Itaposs guaranteed that the people they robbed replaced the stuff they stole the first time, and often these replacements are of better quality than the original.” Although this can be scary to think about, upgrading your home’s security is the easiest way to keep those repeat offenders at bay. Anthony explained: “As they’ve had time to assess the whole property, they know the layout of the house and can be clinical in their approach. “Ensure thatyou have been burgled, extra security measures such as CCTV, alarms and locks are in pace to prevent it happening again.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CCTVCrimeBurglary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They checked in at the easyJet desk at Bristol Airport on Friday and handed over their baggage and car seat at the check-in desk. The family were planning to drive from Lisbon across the border to western Spain to stay with Ireneaposs family for the ceremony on Saturday. Leigh and Irene had filled in their Passenger Locator Forms but did not think they needed one for two-year-old Antonio.However, at the check-in, they were given a form to fill in for the toddler and then went through security as normal, Bristol Live reports.Has something similar happened to you  Email webnews@mirror  Leigh said: We were pushing Antonio in his pushchair and when we got to the bottom of the steps to the plane, I carried him up the steps, and a guy with the ground crew took the pushchair and put it with the rest of the luggage to go on the plane. The family from Long Ashton, near Bristol, settled down for a routine flight, landed in Lisbon and thought nothing untoward had happened until they waited an hour in vain for their luggage to arrive at Lisbon Airport. When they contacted easyJet, they were left fuming as they were told the airline had taken their luggage, car seat and pushchair off the plane. Leigh and Irene were stunned when easyJet said it was because their systems had flagged that the three passengers had been denied boarding at the exact moment they were settling down on board the plane. The dad-of-one said: I phoned up easyJet and said aposweaposre in Lisbon, can you send on our baggage apos and they said aposno you werenapost on the plane, you were denied boarding, your boarding passes werenapost scanned, so we took your stuff off the planeapos.  We had no idea. Looking back, they were more concerned with making sure everyone had their Passenger Locator Forms than they were actually checking us in and scanning our boarding passes, and they said we never boarded, but we did, we flew on the plane and we’re here in Spain. Iaposve had an email from easyJet saying apossorry you didnapost get your flightapos, and then another email askingwe’ll be getting theflight. Itaposs really concerning. Leigh said he is worried about safety on planes as well because nobody checkedtheir seats were actually empty. He explained: There are Civil Aviation Authority rules about knowing exactly who is on every flight. If that plane had to make a forced landing or we all had to be evacuated or something, they wouldn’t have looked for us, they thought we weren’t on board.  The captain of that plane should not have taken off because they had a list of people they thought were on the plane and we were on the plane but not on their list. Why, when they got the order to take our stuff off the plane because they thought we werenapost on it, didnapost they check our seats  They would have found us sitting in them. Due to the incident, Leigh, Irene and little Antonio were left without their belongings, so they were forced to buy a car seat and a pushchair in Portugal. Leigh said: My we is seven months pregnant at the moment. All our stuff for the wedding, suits, dresses, presents and so on, was in our luggage so we didn’t have that for the wedding on Saturday and we have the clothes we came in. I’ve lost luggage before - once I flew back from New York and the airline managed to get it to me in Bristol the next day. This is dferent. easyJet have refused to send it to us because they said we are not out here, when we did fly on their plane. In Spain we’ve got nothing, and over the weekend they were not even saying when or eventhey will send over our luggage. Iaposve been on the phone to easyJet a lot, obviously, and one woman was questioning that we were really in Spain. She said their records showed that we had been denied boarding, and hadnapost flown, but we did - we were on that flight. Thataposs really worrying, that that could happen. Itaposs been four days now and they called again on Monday to ask what the address is weaposre staying at. So hopefully it will all be sent over, but we have plans to go to another address this week, and what do we do  Everything is wrecked, the wedding and our trip so far. EasyJet told The Mirror that the problem occurred at the gate during boarding and an investigation is ongoing. The airline said the luggage has since been delivered and the company has apologised to the family for the delay. EasyJet said in a statement: easyJet works closely with all of our airports and partners to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and crew.We have launched an investigation with our ground handling partners at Bristol Airport to understand what happened in this instance and have apologised to Mr Husband and Ms Garcia Santos for the delay in reuniting them with their luggage, which has since been delivered to them.The safety and well-being of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority.

Owners Mandie Pannell, , and her partner Thomas Mills, , are so proud of her veteran donor Weasley that heaposs been entered for a special hero award. The university nurse educator said: Weasley is absolutely a hero. He’s so good with blood donations. He looks after the dog – especially when he’s scared – and he looks after our younger cat, who we are hoping will donate when he turns one. “Weasley’s so comfortable donating and purrs so much they even find it dficult to hear his heartbeat. “I entered him for the Petplan Pet Awards, in the Hero Pet of the Year category, as I also thought it would help spread the word about animal blood donors and he’s made it to the finals. “Not enough people know about animal – and especially feline – donors. “This is England – we’re a nation of animal lovers. We do things for each other. And it’s just a nice thing to be able to help someone ’s animal out.” When Mandie and fuel delivery driver Thomas, near Potter’s Bar, Herts., met nine years ago, they already had his dog Spock.  In November , Weasley joined the family as Mandieaposs surprise birthday present for her st.She said: “He found him on the website Gumtree – you really can get anything on there.“He’s named after the Weasley family in Harry Potter – as he’s ginger and he’s trouble!” Weasley and Spock also have a very close bond. Mandie said: “From the get-go, Weasley has veered between bullying and cuddling up to Spock. “They’re like siblings – eventhey sometimes hate each other. But they can also be really sweet together.” Mandie signed the pets up as blood donors after she had to take Weasley to the vet when he limped home with a wound on his back leg in .  Mandie said: “It really upset me. We sensed that he’d attacked something and lost. He had a laceration and a bit of flesh missing from his leg.” She took Weasley to the nearby Royal Veterinary College. Mandie said: While we were waiting, I saw a sign that they were looking for animal blood donors. I’d never known this to be a thing before that.” Once Weasley recovered she sought out more information. She said: They have to be clear of any medication for eight weeks, so about three months after the injury he gave his first lot of blood. “He’s just given his th donation – as it’s every three to four months for cats. He’s a true hero.” She says she gets contacted every  weeks to bring Weasley in for a donation. Weasley gets a thorough health check by a vet, gets a patch of fur shaved off and then heaposs ready to donate. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.His owner added: I drop him off and they phone when the donation is finished. Then he gets intravenous fluids just to help him, as cats don’t recover as much as dogs, as they’re quite small. “The actual donation takes around  minutes and after three or four hours I go and pick him up.” The service also assesses the animals beforehand to ensure they are suitable to be blood donors. Mandie said: “One of the things I love about the donor service is that they are so good with animals. They assess them first and seetheir temperament is suitable and they won’t be unduly stressed. “Weasley has been so chilled – he’s an ideal candidate. “We can often hear him purring from the next room and he gets so much attention there that I think he quite likes donating!” The amount of blood donated also depends on the weight of the cat – who must weigh lb minimum. For Spock, who became a donor around the same time, the process is quicker, as dogs do not need rehydration fluids afterwards. Neither pet has ever required sedation. And Mandie is proud her pets are contributing to a vital service. She said: “The teams that do this are absolutely amazing at keeping the animals calm. “They’re also excellent at dealing with the worries of an owner – as sometimes it’s like with children, when the parents are more worried than the child. “But I knowsomething happened to one of my animals and they needed blood I’d want it to be there, so this really is important. “The idea of another pet owner not having access to the blood that could save their beloved animal just breaks my heart.” She added: “Not enough people know about cat blood donation and I saw this award as a really good way to try and bring a little bit more awareness to it. “And, of course, Weasley is a true hero, so he deserves to win. “They do have quite a few blood donor dogs, but they’re really short of cats, so maybe this will encourage more owners to put their cats forward.” Comment MORE ON PetplanCatsAnimalsGood News\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate Codrington and her partner Ian Davis have enjoyed living in their newly painted home since around August last year, up until Watford Borough Council found out about the job from a mystery complainant and took action. The pair learned from the council that they needed to have secured planning permission before painting the house and in lieu of this, were told to submit a retrospective planning application. Kate said the pair were “severely shocked” to find out the application for their Oxhey home had been refused this month. In the council decision report, the officer described the lilac colour as being “inappropriate to the period of the building which would have used stone-like colours”. Other painted neighbouring properties in the street are “finished in mostly cream and off-white shades, theWatford Observer reports .The lilac colour “harms the character and appearance” of the property and conservation area it sits in and is “unacceptable” in terms of design, the officer added. In response to the officer’s comments, Kate said the council should be focusing on “much bigger issues” such as foodbanks. One of the primary reasons the application was turned down was because it lies within a conservation area. This restricts work to properties which could normally be done without planning permission.  In a bid to change this moving forward, Kate and Ian have started a petition to abolish the conservation zone in Oxhey, which was introduced in . The petition, which has so far received  signatures, describes conservation areas as unfair, costly and an undemocratic burden on those who live within themThe idea of abolishing the status has been met with a mixed reaction from members of a local Facebook group, although the majority appear baffled by the council’s refusal.Kate said the pair initially had their house repainted as a way to “lt hearts” on a grey day. “The world needs more joy and colour. The house had been shabby for two years and it showed dirt,” she said.” We didnapost know permission was needed and I wasnapost aware about the conservation zone.” While she said the pair “love living in Oxhey”, she added that it was an architectural jumble, with little in the way of building design to be conserved. She added: We donapost know who complained. To live in a community as friendly and erse as ours and for someone to be so spiteful to complain is disappointing.” While Kate was determined that “moaners and council bureaucracy” wouldn’t ruin her mental health, she said she and Ian had been considering what action they could take about the decision. Ben Martin, head of planning and development at Watford Borough Council said planning issues ranged “hugely” in scale from the paint used on a house in the conservation area to large scale developments providing much-needed homes for Watford families. However big or small the application, we carefully consider each and every one against the planning policies and guidance that apply to that specic project to get the right outcome for our community,” he said. Protecting the town’s heritage remains a big issue for a number of residents.

The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively.

In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right.

Lily spent £. on her Nandoaposs delivery, which a Deliveroo driver brought directly to her blue Mini. Her delivery instructions read: I am in the queue for petrol in my car, my car is a blue Mini. Lily also got a visit from her aunt, who lives down the road and brought her more snacks as she waited in the queue in Kingsbury, northwest London. Lily added: I joined the queue just before lunchtime. My car was on zero and Iaposve got to do the school run. Everything in me was saying aposgo home you idiotapos as I was sat there getting so hungry. It took me an hour to get around one side of a roundabout. I sat there and I thought about what my husband was having for lunch and got really hungry. The traffic was moving so slowly so I thought I could get a Deliveroo where I was. I put the delivery pin a little bit further down the road and he just pulled up right outside my window.Lily, who works at a tech firm, documented her Nandoaposs delivery in a Twitter thread and other social media users praised Lily as an absolute hero and thanked her for brightening up their days. Helen Carr said: You are an absolute hero! Well done on the Nandoaposs, your lovely aunt, and the petrol x. Jodie agreed: Fantastic! Well done on finally getting fuel! Loved the Nandoaposs and Auntie food deliveries - absolute genius. Daniel Barker said: Lily this is spectacular. Lily said that the petrol station was absolutely mental when she finally arrived two hours after leaving her home. She could only fill up with £ of fuel due to new restrictions and even got stuck behind someone who had put the wrong fuel in their car. Lily said: Itaposs like the hunger games. The forecourts are filled with people with their fuel canisters. There are normal people marshalling others around the station. Itaposs a really charged atmosphere.

Or cry because  months into a pandemic and the misery caused by lockdowns, isolation, bereavements, job losses and other money woes, we now find ourselves unable to go out because we have no petrol.“How is le in England ” my uncle from Karachi asked the other day. “Well, we have food and fuel shortages and I had to wait a month for an emergency blood test,” I replied. “And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” How the tables have turned. Great Britain has now become a great big joke. Secretary of State for Culture Nadine Dorries can tweet all she likes about how ‘THERE IS NO FUEL SHORTAGE’ butthe pumps have run dry then more fuel her. Do you agree with Anila  Have your say in the comments below Ministers are desperately throwing out ideas to avert this crisis, such as drafting in the Army and issuing , short term visas, but why would anyone from Europe answer our SOS when they were so inhumanely treated before They fare much better in other European countries and aren’t treated like dirt.There are also plans afoot to introduce training programmes so that people here can learn to be HGV drivers even though haulage company bosses have long been warning about a shortage of workers.And surelyit was that appealing we wouldn’t have had a shortage in the first place  It feels like history is about to repeat itself. In the s and aposs my parents’ generation were told that this country needed them. War had decimated the economy and immigrants from the colonies were needed to rebuild the nation. They faced deep hostility from some native Brits who put up signs on their doors like ‘No dogs, no Irish, no Pak…’ Still, they kept the wheels of industry turning by enduring horric conditions working in the ‘dark satanic mills’ and kept the country moving by driving buses and working as conductors.  This time it is not war which has caused shortages but the utter incompetence of the Tory government who have been in power for over a decade. Brexit cost billions and yet we are all so much worse off than before. Sono-one from Europe wants to be humiliated again, where do you think the drivers will come from  I would not be surprisedpeople from the Asian subcontinent and former colonies will be expected to fill the vacancies, the absolute last thing that the diehard Brexiteers wanted in the first place. Or, just like our elders who came to drive buses, will our youngsters now be told they need to retrain as HGV drivers  Suddenly it has gone very quiet from those who were highly vocal about ‘them foreigners coming here and taking all our jobs’. It was always the jobs that no-one  wanted and now there is no-one to do them. When it comes to sorting out this mess who exactly is in the driving seat  Because it sure as hell isn’t the Tories.

The analysis was based on , survey responses between July  and July . Nearly , pupils and over , staff in primary and secondary school took part in the study.  Of these,  staff and  secondary school pupils were identied as previously having Covid-. The survey from the Office for National Statisticsestimates that about . per cent of staff and . per cent of secondary school pupils with a previously confirmed Covid- infection reported experiencing ongoing symptoms more than four weeks from the start of the infection. Among those experiencing ongoing symptoms, . per cent of staff and . per cent of secondary school pupils said their ability to carry out day-to-day activities had been signicantly reduced. The Schools Infection Study, from Public Health England , the ONS and the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine , questioned staff and pupils in schools in July.  The ONS stressed that the data presented in the study was not representative of all schools in England. Of survey respondents experiencing ongoing symptoms, about half of staffand secondary school pupilsreported that their ability to carry out general day-to-day activities reduced a little. For staff experiencing ongoing symptoms, the majority said their ability to carry out activities at work reduced a littleor not at all . Meanwhile, about one in  staffexperiencing ongoing symptoms reported that their ability to carry out activities at work had reduced either by a lot, by about half or they were unable to work because of ongoing symptoms.  The majority of staffwho experienced ongoing symptoms more than four weeks after their Covid- infection said they had not had any days absent from work as a result. About . per cent were absent for five days or less, . per cent were absent between six and  days, and . per cent had been absent from work for  days or more. Meanwhile,  per cent of secondary school pupils reported that they attended all of school as normal, despite experiencing ongoing symptoms. A third of secondary school pupils who experienced ongoing symptoms said they had attended more than half of school, . per cent attended about half, and . per cent attended less than half, the figures suggest.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “This survey data reveals the largely hidden long-term effects of Covid on both students and school and college staff. “It is pleasing to note that, despite suffering ongoing and debilitating symptoms, more than half of the staff and young people who responded to the survey had ed to the classroom within four weeks of initially testing positive.“We obviously have concerns about the number of staff reporting that their ability to perform their normal day-to-day duties had been affected by ongoing coronavirus symptoms such as tiredness and shortness of breath.“These findings again reinforce the importance of the Covid vaccination programme, including  to -year-olds, in helping to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in schools and colleges.” Comment MORE ON Office for National StatisticsEducationSchoolsSecondary schoolCoronavirusLong Covid\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Celiaaposs charity isnapost as widely known as the bigger animal charities like the RSPCA and PDSA. But her dedication and achievements have been acknowledged as Celia has won a string of accolades including The Mirroraposs Pride of Britain award in  and The Mirroraposs Animal Hero Awards in .  Celia told the Mirror that while her charity is relatively unknown their share of the workload to help injured, rescued and abandoned animals is disproportionally high and the lockdown has made this even worse. It has been terrible for animal charities. Everyone is hurting financially, she said. Animals were starving because the restaurants were shut so there was no food. I donapost think people realised how much animals were struggling during the lockdown as some animals became very injured.  There are a lot of people who are trying to contact other charities to get help and now the RSPCAaposs animal hospital in Putney has closed down people are turning to us. So people living in the areas that the hospital served now have nothing. We donapost have the name of the big charities but we sure have a big workload. Celia had a passion for looking after animals since she was very young before she attended Lucie Clayton College - a modelling school which boasts former model turned actress Joanna Lumley and Jean Shrimpton as Celiaaposs contemporaries.  After graduating, Celia caught the eye of the renowned photographer Norman Parkinson and she was catapulted to fame as a model during the swinging s where she strutted down catwalks. I was a model for  years but I never liked the catwalks, Celia said. I did it for a year and I hated it. One day Celia was ing to the flat she shared with several other young women in West Hampstead, London, when she spotted a cat sitting at the window inside a derelict house.  This cat would unknowingly change Celiaaposs le for ever. She said: I went back to the house with a girl I was flat-sharing with and we found the cat with her kittens and some had starved to death. The mum was so skinny so we rescued her. As we were leaving the building we saw a woman feeding another cat so I gave her my number in case she needed me. That woman give my number to someone  and they passed my number on and before I knew it people were calling me from all over London asking me to help with cat rescues. Celia found herself being called to so many rescues that she was cancelling modelling jobs to do them - a move that angered her agent.  My agent told me I have to concentrate on one thing modelling or animals so I gave up my job, she said. I moved to Kent and was driving to London four or five times a week to rescue cats before taking them to a private vet who was absolutely brilliant and would neuter them for £ each. Despite the low cost Celia said her vet bills began to mount up. She said: Cats were having lots of kittens that nobody wanted so half of them ended up out on the street. I did all my work through the generous vet, but it became glaring obvious that we were never going to get on top of this stray animals problem until people could afford to get their pets neutered. You wonapost see any improvement until the number of unwanted kittens being born was tackled. I opened my first clinic in  and we have saved hundreds and thousands of animals since then. Celia now runs two clinics in London, which treat cats and dogs, and a sanctuary near Hastings, East Sussex. But during the lockdown Celia was forced to scale back the treatment she offered and concentrate on rescues only which meant many animals unable to be neutered. She said: We did a lot of emergency work with strays and injured animals during he lockdown because we were allowed to but we couldnapost do anything routine. This means we are playing catch up with neutering animals. It has been an incredibly dficult  months.  Rocketing private vet fees, the closure of the RSPCA-owned animal hospital in southwest London and the lockdown has proven to be an unwelcome recipe for Celiaaposs charity as more and more desperate pet owners turn to her for help. Things have changed in the last thee or four years since so many private practices were bought out by corporate companies which charge huge fees, she said. Something that would normally be quoted for thousands of pounds privately we do for a fraction of the price but thereaposs only so much we can do because we are one small charity which is funded privately.  Even our supporters are struggling and because weaposre not incredibly well known weaposre not in a great financial position. We do get some legacies but nothing like the bigger charities. Yet more and more owners of sick pets are desperately looking for somewhere that they can get help so they come to us.Celia said despite the eye-watering prices for treatment in the private vet industry there is actually a shortage of practitioners due to Brexit.A lot have gone back to eastern Europe and a lot are doing locum work as as you get more money.  We get so many stray cats with fractures as they fall off balconies and we are referred to by private vets because they are so expensive. We have a lot of cats referred to us as they have a blocked bladder which would cost £, - £, to treat privately. We charge £ and that includes the cat staying in a clinic for three days and we typically treat  cats a week. Something needs to happen as people are now saying they wonapost have pets because vets are so expensive. Pet insurance is expensive and it often wonapost cover the things people need to claim for. A lot are being referred to us and we are doing what we can but itaposs incredibly dficult at this level as we donapost have the money. When people come to us and we help them they sayit wasnapost for us they couldnapost afford to keep pets and we canapost cover the whole country as we are just a small charity. We try and price the treatment to cover our costs but people just donapost have the money. We donapost have the money to provide the extensive service we used to do and we donapost want to be in a position where we turn animals away but what are we to do To make a donation or for more information about the work Celia does visit celiahammond.org Comment MORE ON Celia HammondCatsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Since she and Prince Harry stepped down as senior royals early last year and moved to the US, Meghan has not ed to visit.Harry has ed twice - for Prince Philipaposs funeral and for the unveiling of a statue of his mother Princess Diana. But their son Archie has also not travelled back to the UK since the move, and three-month-old daughter Lilibet, who was born in Calornia, is yet to visit Britain.There has been speculation that the Sussexes could make ato the UK to visit at Christmas or possibly to have Lilibet christened. There has also been talk that they could come to the UK next year for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June.But speaking on the Royally US podcast, royal expert and author Robert Jobson suggested: I’m not sure Meghan will ever come to Britain again, she’s not popular here now. “The idea of her standing next to the Queen, doting on the Queen, when you’ve got a book coming out in which you’re going to spill more dirty linen in public does seem a little hypocritical.

I’m sure Harry thinks he’ll be there for the th - the Platinum Jubilee. “But you’ve got to remember that within months he’s going to have a book coming out. He added: “The focus should not be on whether Meghan’s happy or not, or whether Harry’s looking the wrong way at his brother.  “And that’s exactly what will be the case, and that would be wrong in my opinion because the Queen deserves more than that. Harry and Meghan have just ed to their home in Calornia following a whirlwind three-day tour of New York City.They made a series of appearances around New York City and met with political figures, including the New York mayor Bill de Blasio and the US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield. The couple also visited children at a school in Harlem and appeared at the Global Citizen Live event in Central Park, where they called for vaccine equity when it comes to the Covid- vaccine.Meghan said: “Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine but thataposs not happening. “It is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just ten wealthy nations and not everyone , itaposs just not OK.” While Harry added: “Guys, we have what we need to vaccinate the world.” Comment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Officials say the decision to not allow patients inside was put in place because of Covid safety regulations. They said there had been an extremely high demand for AE - but have been blasted for the long wait to get seen. A parent whose daughter, , had a four-hour wait for an X-ray has described what the family went through. Maria, who did not want to give her full name, detailed how six patients were sat outside with one being sick as they waited.  It is absolutely shocking, she told the BBC. You think you may have pneumonia, youaposre coughing horribly, and youaposre in the cold - itaposs not the best place to be. When we were sent round to the Covid AE, the panorama was this horrible car park with ambulances and people, some sitting. I couldnapost even see a chair for us. They said aposyou have to wait outside, it could take lots of hoursapos. We were in disbelief, the people around us didnapost look well at all, the woman next to us was throwing up, and in front of us, ambulances were arriving. We were watching all these horrors coming in.  Hospital bosses acknowledge that staff are “tired and, in some cases, traumatised by the pandemic response and all of its impacts”.Labour MP Daniel Zeichner told the Cambridge Independent : “The pressure on hospitals has not dropped, and I have been watching the numbers closely across the summer and into autumn.“The data convinced me that we remain in a very precarious position, which is why it is so important that everyone continues to take the simple precautions that help.”With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

Jemma, who also competes in triathlons in her spare time, lives with her train service controller husband, Mark, , their children, Louis, , Magnus, four, and Bronwen, three. Speaking of her shock diagnosis, Jemma said it was Covid that “saved [her] le”. “Had I been working and not been off, I would have just carried on as normal,” she said. “I’ve been quite lucky. Jemma, who has now had three rounds of surgery to remove her cancerous tumours, succumbed to Covid- while she was training for a triathlon in October . She was “knocked sideways,” she said, struggling to get upstairs and even to breathe. A month later, she was still suffering with a sore throat and had noticed a lump in her neck, so decided to see a doctor, thinking she had Long Covid. Phoning her GP, Jemma was asked to come in for blood tests and an examination and was swtly referred for an ultrasound at Ellesmere Port Hospital four days later. Just  hours after that, her doctor called to tell her a “suspicious nodule” had been found on her thyroid, a small gland at the base of the neck that produces hormones. The doctor was also concerned by her backache and the blood she had passed in her urine. She said: “I travel a lot by car for work, so I do get water infections when I can’t get to the loo when I need to, as it puts pressure on the bladder. Driving can also give me back pain. Suggesting she could have kidney stones, which can also be linked to the thyroid, her GP sent her for a further ultrasound on her right kidney – only for a mass to be detected on the organ. Following an MRI and CT scan, Jemma was called into the hospital on New Year’s Eve, . “They told me it was suspected cancer and that they’d need to operate as soon as possible,” she said. Transferred to Merseyside’s Arrowe Park Hospital in Birkenhead, Jemma’s partial kidney removal – a procedure known as a nephrectomy – was scheduled for mid-February , but because of Covid, was delayed to March . Meanwhile, her ear, nose and throat specialist was keen to operate on her thyroid but, with her kidney being a major organ, medics agreed to prioritise this procedure first. Jemma, who had to isolate for ten days prior to and ten days after her surgery, said having her kidney out was “tough” both physically and mentally. Getting up and walking hurt, she said, and she struggled to go to the toilet so needed a catheter put in. She was also left with six scars on her abdomen. Once she was back on her feet, she went under the kne again – this time for surgery on her thyroid, as neither form of cancer was treatable in her case with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. On May , at the Countess of Chester Hospital, in Chester, Cheshire, surgeons removed half, then all of her thyroid, finding papillary thyroid cancer – the most common type – on the right side of the organ. Her second operation was performed four weeks later on June , at the same hospital, followed by checks on her lymph nodes. Now awaiting further scans on her thyroid and kidneys, which she will have every three, six and  months for the next  years, to monitor for regrowth, she also takes daily thyroid medication to replace the thyroxine hormone the organ made. “Medics will perform regular blood tests, too, which would show any regrowth or thyroid hormones occurring naturally – which I shouldn’t have, as I now don’t have the organ,” Jemma explained.  “My kidney wasn’t great news when they did the biopsy, as a little bit has been possibly left in – but I was told it is a slow-growing cancer.” Jemma said she was “still really tired” with a lot of back pain, but said that “all things considered” she was in great shape. However, another concern for Jemma is a nodule which has been spotted on her right lung. She was undergoing regular full-body scans to keep an eye on the size, and was also looking into genetic testing, to find out whether she is biologically prone to any other forms of the disease. Jemma is now readjusting to normal le – and getting back to her usual active lestyle – taking part in the Macmillan Mighty Hike last month, walking  miles across the Lake District with her husband and a close friend, to thank the Macmillan nurses who supported her throughout her treatment. “That was horrendous,” she laughed. “It was really tough, but mentally did me the world of good just being able to show myself that I could still get out there and do things.” She also hosted a Macmillan coffee morning on Saturday, September  to support the cancer charity, which is encouraging people to get together with friends and family to raise funds during the month. She had also been focusing on having some fun as a family, getting out for some bonding time and even touring London to take in the sights. Jemma’s message to anyone with similar mysterious symptoms is crystal clear - don’t ignore symptoms, hoping they will just go away. “The sooner they find these things the sooner they can deal with them,” she said. Sarah Page, from Macmillan, also stresses the need to have any troublesome symptoms checked by a doctoryou feel anything could be wrong. “It has been a dficult  months and we’ve lost time in cancer care,” she added. At Macmillan we’ve lost over a year of vital fundraising. We’re sadly down by millions, which is money desperately needed.”“ Coronavirus will leave a lasting legacy for cancer care. If we are going to be there for everyone with cancer from day one, we need your support.”Comment MORE ON TriathlonCancerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The incredible pictures of the Scottish house, which has been abandoned since , show a retro living room featuring an armchair, sofa, lamp and a fireplace. Though intact, the furniture could be seen gradually succumbing to nature, as wallpaper peeled from the walls and mould sprouted from the sofas. In another, a wall mounted shelf bursting with abandoned trinkets, including a wooden lighthouse thermometer and porcelain figurines could be seen. The photographs were taken by urban explorer No Limits Urbex from Manchester, UK, who documents their adventures at @nolimitsurbex.  They used a Nikon Coolpix p camera to capture the shots at an abandoned cottage in Inverness, Scotland. Speaking about how the project came about, the photographer behind @nolimitsurbex, said he came across the cottage after some extensive land registry research and packed his bags to make the trip soon after. Situated on a mountainside in the middle of Scotland this lovely idyllic cottage had been left to decay for the last three decades,” they said.  After the death of the last remaining family member in  the home was seized by the local authorities so it didnapost fall into disrepair and become an eyesore. The Housing Act  allows councils to take ownership of properties and intervene to stop abandoned properties from being squatted or vandalised.Other than a little bit of interior weather damage, the cottage has remained largely intact. The photographer said it had been left “littered with antique quirkiness” with everything seeming to have its own place. It had been left in a state of suspended animation with even the wedding pictures still on display,” they said. Photographers dubbed aposurban explorersapos have long been scouting out homes that have been abandoned, documenting the houses and sharing the eerie photographs online.  Earlier this year The Mirror reported on an home found abandoned in East Yorkshire, which has been unoccupied for years and features fascinating treasures inside. Frozen in time, the property, known locally as the Horsemanaposs House is in Ousefleet near Goole, could be mistaken for the setting of a Stephen King horror movie.Dozens of horse trinkets line the shelves of long forgotten rooms, along with yellowing piles of books, stained mugs, and frayed pictures of horses all over the walls, reported Yorkshire Live. In fact, there are so many images and ornaments of the animals the property is known locally as the Horsemanaposs House. The remarkable pictures were captured by another urban explorer, YouTuber Kyle Urbex, who travels around the country documenting abandoned buildings and putting them on social media. The house is full of animal-related trinkets and décor, including dozens of horse figures and photos, and a box of stuffed owls.  “Itaposs locally dubbed the Horsemanaposs House due to the vast collection of horse memorabilia such as figures. Pictures. Posters. All horse related,” Kyle said. “Inside I found everything ranging from brass clinging to the walls, horse figures on a shelf in the upper bedroom, old bread rolls scattered across the floor and other little trinkets and ornaments.” Along with the horse memorabilia and décor, Kyle also found oddities like a box of stuffed owls, a plate marking the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, a mannequin’s head with several straw hats on it and dozens of tin containers.

Albanian Koci Selamaj, , appeared at Willesden magistrates court today for a hearing which lasted approximately two minutes in front of a packed public gallery. He stood calmly with his hands clasped together, wearing grey prison-issue tracksuit and blue facemask and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. Prosecutor Umaima Peracha said the charge against the defendant is murder on September . He was not asked to formally enter a plea to a single charge of murder but was asked by District Judge Denis Brennan for an indication of his plea.  His lawyer Aidan Harvey, said: “I have indicated on the form it will be a not-guilty plea.” Mr Harvey earlier told the court that although an interpreter was in the building, his client’s English was “sufficient for today’s purposes”. The judge told Selamaj: “Your first hearing there will be a bail hearing on September  with the plea and trial preparation hearing being on October . “I will remand you in custody.”  Selamaj, who is understood to have been working as a food delivery driver in Eastbourne, was arrested in the early hours of Sunday and charged on Monday.

The exterior stairway at a Holiday Inn hotel was constructed from the wrong type of wood and had not been properly maintained. A total of  guests plunged onto the hard courtyard below and seven had to be rushed to hospital. The court was told that two of the victims suffered long-term injuries. Last week magistrates handed out fines totalling £, to the hotel owners and a management company. The prosecution was brought by Dacorum Borough Council. Cllr Julie Banks said: “I consider the safety of local residents and visitors to be an imperative. We will vigorously investigate and take appropriate enforcement action where serious safety failings lead to serious injuries or deaths. “All those involved in running businesses and operations should understand that they may face prosecution for their part in such failings, as the two companies did here. Peterborough Magistrates’ Court heard the stairs at the hotel in Hemel Hempstead, were constructed from laminated softwood. Although they were regularly used, particularly for wedding photos, they had not been maintained leaving the timber rotten. The posts holding up the stairs were in particularly bad condition. The dramatic collapse occurred in  while a wedding party at the hotel was gathering for photos. The court heard the upper flight of stairs gave way like a trapdoor. HICP Ltd, which had owned the hotel since , was ordered to pay a fine, costs and surcharge totalling more than £,. Interstate United Kingdom Management Limited, which assisted HICP in the management of the hotel, was ordered to pay penalties of almost £,. The sentencing took place on September . Rebecca Connolly, a health and safety worker at DBC, helped investigate the incident. She said: Those who operate premises, which they charge the public to use, are required by law to put in place adequate arrangements to monitor the state of those premises and to ensure necessary repair or replacement work is identied and done. External timber structures are notoriously subject to decay and regular and rigorous checks on them need to be conducted by persons competent to do those checks.

At the stroke of a pen, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to make a dramatic U-turn, offering temporary three-month visas to foreign lorry drivers and poultry workers in a bid to tackle the petrol and food shortage. Christmas is coming, you see. The Government needs to ensure we have fuel in our cars, food on our tables, booze in our shops and presents around our trees. Just like the black England footballers who came up short in this summer’s European Championship Final, immigrants are welcomed when they are useful – and discarded when we’re not. Probably, in the case of those EU drivers, on Boxing Day when they’ll start being demonised again. Trouble is, those already exiled are delivering a long, slow, lingering two fingers up to Johnson and his incompetents who are convinced they will come stampeding back into a country that doesn’t want them. The man from the Dutch road hauliers association summed it up deliciously on Radio  yesterday morning. “The EU drivers I speak to will not come on temporary visas to drag the UK out of the s*** they created for themselves,” he said. Quite right, too. Who knew that this country would eventually be forced, once again, to its knees before having to acknowledge the crucial contributions of foreigners  It’s asthe Sixties, the Seventies and the Eighties never happened. Yes, a crucial takeaway from this entire Brexit dog’s dinner is the need to appreciate the importance of British lorry drivers. For far too long they’ve been underpaid, working anti-social hours, often in awful conditions. Now, with McDonalds out of milkshake, pubs running low on beer, one in six adults unable to buy essential items of food and queues snaking around the block at petrol pumps across the land, something is finally starting to give. The politicians, the erstwhile cheerleaders – and even some broadcasters – are bending over backwards not to call it Brexit. And yes, there may well be other contributory factors. But the overriding common denominator is the xenophobia that has left this country starting to implode. It is down to the Government’s determination to detach us from our European neighboursthat we will likely have turkey shortages ahead of Christmas – while blood tests could be limited with the NHS’s biggest supplier of sample bottles running low because of “transportation challenges” and “UK border challenges”. Across this weekend we saw fights on petrol station forecourts, people taking their lives into their own hands by filling up plastic bottles with the stuffand heard fuel drivers’ tales of being followed by desperate motorists tracking their every turn. Instead of owning up to the shambles of their own making, the Government and its apologists are lashing out at Shadow Chancellor Angela Rayner for using a term used so often to describe Johnson by ordinary people – probably even by the families of his own he has walked out on - it’s a wonder his ears haven’t melted. This nightmare has been a long time coming. My own parents and relatives came here as part of a Windrush generation that helped rebuild this country in the Sixties and Seventies, yet is now being demonised. Today’s “bloody foreigners” have no intention of subjecting themselves to similar manipulation. Good for them.

We couldn’t quite believe we’d won when we were contacted! We’re pretty used to winning gin-tasting competitions - but this was out of the blue. We think our business is special because we put people, the planet and fun at the very heart of everything we do. We pay the Living Wage and make sure everyone is fully trained and gets any outside training they may need. York Gin only launched in  but has also grown rapidly. The team added: When we started, two of us were working in a cold former chicken shed, making the gin and bottling, labelling and packing everything by hand. We had a good hunch that the local market would provide some demand for a locally-made gin - in fact one of our directors, Paul, is a pub landlord, so we thought at least we’ll have one customer!The team are looking forward to using the new Square Stand Kit, adding: We are always interested in trying new solutions to tricky problems like payments. The loyalty programme Square offers looks particularly interesting.We have plans to grow - but in a controlled and sustainable manner. We have plans to open a second shop in York.

Tony added: Five years ago, we started manufacturing in a tiny  square foot rented barn building, with a lot of time spent on design and selling a couple units per month. We then doubled the size of our space. During the  lockdown to keep up with growth, we successfully partnered with some local welding schools and have now negotiated new partnerships which have given us the capacity to supply a number of garden centres in addition to our own direct sales.

Itaposs not just the endless traffic jams, dealing with other road users and the low pay, it also changes you as a person the longer you do it. I used to be quite sociable during my time in the RAF, but after I left to have a family and took up driving for a living, I became more insular and inward-looking. Often youaposd barely speak to another person all day long, and that takes its toll on you mentally. Thereaposs also the physical side of things to deal with. Most drivers have little to no access to fresh food, so your entire diet is whatever you find at the service station. Unless youaposve got your own lorry with a mini fridge, you canapost get up at am and keep food chilled all day until you can pull over to eat it. I used to suffer badly with IBS, which was exacerbated by driving  hours a day, and never got time to exercise as I was exhausted by the time I got home. Driving full-time not only puts a strain on your health, but also on your relationships and family. It was very tough on my we coping with the children at home and holding down her own job while I was out on the road.  After five or six years I took a £, pay cut to get my le back, so Iaposm now earning £, a year. It might not be as much money, but I get to see my two young girls every evening and have a better work le balance. Thereaposs been talk of some recruiters paying £, a year, but youaposd be lucky to earn that even driving flat out. Your pay ranges from minimum wage for unloading cargo to around £ an hour for the unsociable hours driving shts via an agency, but my average pay was about £ a week. You can drive anything between  to  miles a day, five or six days a week. My longest job was Lincoln to Liskeard in Cornwall, then back up to Bristol, then up to Norwich, then Edinburgh, Glasgow and back to Lincoln in five days. You can easily cross the country twice in a week.  There are good and bad jobs in driving - everyone wants the ones with the fewest drops that are closest to home, but sometimes you can be sent miles and miles away on your final sht of the week. My last place stopped paying overtime as some of the workers were taking the mick, so they just paid you for am until pm, for example, and a lot of us would work through our -minute breaks so we could beat the traffic home. Youaposre constantly stressed about timings, which is one of the biggest problems in the industry. I always took my breaks as it wasnapost worth the risk to drive while tired. The facilities for lorry drivers are grim, however. It costs us up to £ to park up for more than two hours at most service stations, and the toilets are usually far away and dirty - so drivers end up relieving themselves round the back of their lorry. Thereaposs usually rubbish dumped all over the lorry park and theyaposre not very secure - sometimes opportunistic thieves will slash the curtainto see whataposs in there, which is why youaposll see some lorries with their back doors left wide open to show theyaposre empty. Every time a vehicleaposs attacked the driver has to wait for their company to come out and fix it. The showers can be unpleasant too, with nowhere to stow your clothes while you freshen up. Sometimes thereaposs just one shower for  tired drivers, so we get used to making do. It can be a very lonely occupation, just you and your thoughts for nine, ,  hours a day. If youaposre unloading at a depot you might exchange a few words with whoeveraposs signing off your paperwork, then youaposre back behind the wheel. I realised I had to leave when I got home after a week away and my toddler daughter happily skipped out to bring my duvet inside, I just thought, aposI canapost do this any moreapos. What I do miss about driving is seeing the sights of the UK. I travelled all over and saw the beautul scenery, but Iaposm so much happier now I get to take part in family le again.

Dr Yardley, a Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University’s Centre for Applied Criminology, shares how factors in this might include biology, neighbourhood, school, health services and their relationship with their mother.She wrote: Why such an emphasis on mothers  What about the fathers  Isnapost this sexist  These are questions that I have encountered a lot over the past few months. I argue that mothers matter more in the making of murderers because of the inherently gendered nature of society. We expect mothers to be selfless nurturers and primary caregivers - expectations we take for granted and apply to all. We defer to mothers, simply assuming that they know best and are prioritising the needs of their child, protecting them from harm both within and outside of the family. As long as mum is on the scene, surely everything will be alright   Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Not in the cases that have been examined in the series - Daniel Bartlam, Fred and Rose West, Jed Allen, Harold Shipman, Dennis Nilsen, Robert Black, Joachim Knychala, Leszek Pekalski, Adam Lanza and Richard Kuklinksi. To ying degrees, whether by act or omission, the mothers of these killers began to write the script for murder.The expert goes on to ulge how the mothers of Fred West and Robert Black among others created brutal environments at home, neglecting or abusing their children. While Shipman and Lanzaaposs mothers were determined to have the best for their children, encouraging their sons to be more like others. Through hypervigilance they tried to be the good mothers that society demands, being selective in the advice that they took on board from outsiders, Dr Yardley explains. Finally, the mothers of Bartlam, Nilsen and Rose West were in denial - looking the other way, unwilling to confront or discuss behaviours that might lead to their children being seen as aposdferentapos. From these findings, Dr Yardley concluded there were three types of mothers that can make a murderer - anti-mothers, uber-mothers and passive mothers.  Anti-mothers According to the expert, this type of mother may have been a victim of abuse and neglect, the survivor of a brutal upbringing who never had a aposhealthyapos family environment. Not all women who experience this will go on to recreate their own situation, but there are some who will. They turn from victims to aggressors themselves, becoming the same type of person they had once despised. Uber-mothers The uber-mothers come from a apostraditionalapos sort of family environment, but they are very aware of societyaposs expectations and have been from an early age. They may have been the victims of discrimination or arbitrary moral framework and as such are determined their own children will not be held back in the same way. In turn, they become mother-managers, planning out their childrenaposs lives and struggling to keep them on course. Dr Yardley describes this kind of parent as the gatekeepers that hold off the outside world, protecting their child from scrutiny as their behaviour becomes increasingly deviant. Passive mothers The third type of mother on the list is scared of how society may judge her children. They have lived their own lives following rules and doing what society expects of them, being quiet, passive and ticking along. If their children begin to cross societyaposs moral and legal boundaries, the fear of labelling compels them to try and deny what is happening. Theyaposll sweep the situation under the rug, ignoring it in hopes that it is just a phase and will go away. Dr Yardley adds: Anti-mothers, uber-mothers and passive mothers thrive because of the considerable cultural value society places on privacy. How mothers bring up their children remains largely aposnone of our businessapos. Privacy can be valuable as it allows us to restrict who has access to our family places and spaces and enables us to control who knows what about our families. However, it can also be the barrier behind which violence, abuse, neglect and denial can thrive - and the making of a murderer can begin.What do you think of the expertaposs findings  Let us know in the comments below.Comment MORE ON PsychologyParentingCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The hotel replied later that day saying that they would do their best to accommodate his request - and they didnapost disappoint. When he arrived at the hotel, the lady at reception laughed when she saw his name and said so youaposre the apple boy  before telling him that five apples had been hidden in his room. After setting his bag down, he found a handwritten note on his bed, which read: Dear Thomas, home is where apples are hidden and water is in plain sight. Let me know how many apples you find. Franzi, - and so the hunt began. He found the first apple in the safe, the second under the bed covers, the third in the fridge and the fourth in a drawer in the bedside cabinet. But after searching far too long for the fth apple, he gave up. The next morning when he woke up, he continued his search, and eventually found the hidden apple in the kettle. The video has since gone viral, amassing a staggering . million views, . million likes and almost , comments from people who praised the employeeaposs efforts. One person said: Thataposs good customer service. Another wrote: Good way to get free snacks. A third put: She really went above and beyond for this one.

The video – which was filmed in Dublin – shows one man in the home slowly lowering the sofa toward the ground, Dublin Live reports.The other two men were standing on a low wall outside the house, and were using sweeping brushes to hold up the sofa so it didn’t come crashing down.

But despite the unsatisfactory ending, the video’s viewers were amazed by the strange technique. One wrote: “Masters at work, hopefully it was successful!” While another said: “It worked and saved hours because it obviously didn’t fit through a door, so they would have had to take it apart. They’re big brained.” And a third posted: “That was actually pretty fantastic.” Other people didn’t find the strategy to be that weird, as they shared similar stories of their own unique ways of getting large pieces of furniture in and out of a house with narrow doorways. Someone said: “My brother and I popped out his sitting room window out last September to swap the suites. Took  minutes and the window popped straight back in.” However, some were unimpressed, with one person writing: “At that stage itaposd nearly have been faster to carry it down the stairs.” While another complained: “It would have been easier to unscrew one of the arms off.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralTikTokUmm what Funny ha ha viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And over the decades, Monacoaposs royal family have endured a series of scandals and tragedies that defy belief. Catapulted to fame in the Fties when Prince Rainier III married Oscar-winning actress Grace Kelly, the House of Grimaldi were stunned when the Hollywood star tragically died in a car accident in . Nearly four decades later, it is now the marriage of her son, Prince Albert II, to former South African swimmer Charlene Wittstock that is grabbing headlines.Known for his hedonistic years as a playboy prince in the Nineties, Albert, , has been forced to admit he fathered two illegitimate children and rumours of discontent have swirled around the ruling leaderaposs marriage.With Princess Charlene, , now absent from Monaco for more than five months amid mysterious health problems, here is how their romance has unfolded. aposLots of people assume it is an arranged marriageapos Prince Albert and Charlene Wittstock, as she was then known, first met in  shortly after the Olympic Games in Sydney. The talented swimmer came fth in her event at the Games, and followed it up by winning the m backstroke at an event in Monaco. Albert himself is a sports fanatic and previously even took part at the Winter Olympics with the principalityaposs bob sled team. It was at that competition in  that the couple made their first official appearance, with Charlene becoming a permanent resident of Monaco the same year. Even during their early relationship, rumours swirled about Albertaposs previous relationships and he was forced to acknowledge the existence of two illegitimate children. After asking Charleneaposs dad, Michael, for her hand in marriage, Albert proposed in June  with a pear-cut engagement ring. Ahead of the marriage, however, it was speculated that the Olympian had got cold feet.  Lots of people got the impression it was an arranged marriage, it’s true, historian and author Philippe Delorme told the French magazine Madame Figaro this month. Albert chose a we who resembled his mother, and Charlene clearly felt very ill at ease in this Grace Kelly role they wanted her to play. As Karl Marx put it: History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce. In a lavish three-day event that kicked off on June , , with a concert by The Eagles, the coupled tied the knot. Onlookers were concerned at pictures of the bride in tears as her husband-to-be looked on distantly, though Charlene later insisted she was just emotional.  Days after the wedding, French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche alleged that she had tried to flee three times ahead of the big day - including once while trying on her dress and a second time at the Monaco Grand Prix. The explosive report quotes sources that confirmed an eventual arrangement was reached between the future bride and groom - later said to be that Charlene would provide Albert with a legitimate heir before being free to leave. Palace officials denied the allegations of cold feet, with a spokesperson telling People magazine: None of this is true, and we think it comes from utter jealousy. Son of Grace Kelly rocked by love child claims The couple now have two children - twins Jacques and Gabriella, six - but their time together has been plagued by sensational claims about Albertaposs other kids. In , Albert confirmed he was the biological father of Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, now , whose mother was Nicole Coste - a former flight attendant from Togo.  The following year, a DNA test confirmed he was also dad to Jazmin Grace, now  - the daughter of Tamara Rotolo, a US estate agent he met in the south of France. Neither child is in the line of succession to the Monaco throne as their parents never married. Last year, Albert was also faced with a paternity suit over a third alleged love child with a Brazilian woman, who gave birth to a daughter in .A source told Mail Online : This was before Charlene and Albert were an item, but the latest case covers a time when she was already in love with him. Charlene has had a terrible year, with one family crisis after another including Albert going down with coronavirus, and now she’s gearing herself up for this hell.Earlier this month, Nicole Coste opened up about her sonaposs relationship with Albert. Alexandre has been welcomed into the royal fold, appearing at Monacoaposs Rose Ball with the family and enjoying a lavish th birthday bash thrown by his dad. Albert made a commitment from the start to be present, and to gradually bring his son into his family, she told French magazine Paris Match. Very quickly, I was reassured when Princess Stephaniebecame Alexanderaposs godmother. Albert has honoured his promise: things are building well and running their course, which I am delighted with. However, while insisting her son had a good relationship with his step siblings, the mum-of-three also hinted at tensions with Charlene. As for Charlene, this is a subject that I cannot avoid because we are often put in parallel. I donapost like being compared. I never advertised myself as an enemy. I am a gentle woman, she said. Given our respective ties to the prince, we should have made sure to support each other cordially. In our situation, diplomacy had to prevail. But during the engagement period, I experienced things that alerted and shocked me. For example, she changed my sonaposs room, taking advantage of his fatheraposs absence to move him to the employee wing. As a mother, I cannot find words to describe these actions. Concern for princess after months away from family Last year, Charlene debuted a dramatic half-shaven haircut, which has become increasingly shorter since. Despite iding royal fans back home, she insisted her family were all supportive of her aposhalf-hawkapos buzz cut - including her husband once the surprise wore off. “Certainly, of all the members of royal families, Iaposm probably the one who has tried the most dferent hairstyles, and Iaposll continue, she told French magazine Point de Vue. “The remarks of ‘But what is she doing ’ and ‘But it’s not royal!’ - I know these all too well. “And I have nothing to say to them, except that we’re in  and that in these times which are so troubling, so dficult, there are other, much more important subjects which deserve our attention.” Since March, the princess has been in her native South Africa, sparking widespread speculation about her long absence from her husband and children. The royal has said she is being treated for an ear and throat infection she contracted in May, which has not allowed her to travel. The stay has mean she missed key events including her th wedding anniversary and her childrenapossto school. Last month, Albert and the children flew out to South Africa to reunite with Charlene, but images of the couple together failed to convince the Monegasques [Monaco residents], insisted Madame Figaro. Charlene has stated she hoped toto Monaco in October and earlier this month Albert insisted she was ready to come home. She didnapost leave Monaco in a huff! he told People. She didnapost leave because she was mad at me or at anybody … She didnapost go into exile. It was absolutely just a medical problem which had to be treated.apos Explaining that his we had planned to travel to South Africa to reassess her foundationaposs work, he admitted he probably should have addressed rumours about their marriage sooner. Of course it affects her, of course it affects me, he added. Misreading events is always detrimental... Weaposre an easy target, easily hit, because weaposre in the public eye a lot.

A spokesman said he asked Kim Boo-kyum: “Hasn’t the time come to prudently consider prohibiting dog meat consumption ”Dog meat used to be commonly eaten in summer, either roasted or in a soup called bosintang, which is believed by some to be beneficial to health in hot weather.Good move by South Korea Join the discussion in the comment section  But restaurants specialising in the dish are becoming scarce, and their customers increasingly elderly. Almost four in five South Koreans believe the slaughter and sale of dog and cat meat should be banned, a poll found this month. Just under half believed consumption of the meat should be a crime.

Local governments have been closing down dog farms and slaughterhouses. Laws have been introduced to reduce cruelty such as hanging live animals up and beating them to tenderise their meat, but such protections are unevenly enforced. Nara Kim, of Humane Society International, said: “I welcome these words from President Moon and hope it signals the beginning of the end for the brutal industry. “These dogs live a dreadful existence, locked in cages their whole lives, most in a pitul state of malnutrition, skin disease and fear, only to be painfully electrocuted often in front of each other. “It’s like a living nightmare, all to produce a meat most Koreans don’t want to eat.” Comment MORE ON AnimalsAnimal crueltyDogsSouth Korea\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The caches - earmarked for US counter-terrorism “over the horizon” attacks against al-Qaeda and Islamic State - were hidden to help the US quickly attack terrorist organisations. Both warehouse-sized stores contained hundreds of thousands of bullets, heavy weapons, missiles, survival supplies and even spare helicopters parts. Sources told The Mirror the supplies contained spares for attack choppers as they would be essential for an on-the-ground mission against networks.It means President Joe Biden ’s threat of future “over the horizon” attacks launched against terrorists without having a permanent Afghan base are battered.Are you worried about the resurgence of the Taliban  Have your say in the comment section  The discoveries by the Taliban in the towns of Mazer-e-Shar , in the north, and Herat, in the west of Afghanistan are deeply embarrassing for the Pentagon. They had been left there as a contingency against a terrorist resurgence across the region as US troops withdrew to Kabul and faced having no in-country base. It also meant a massive special forces and commando raid on terrorists would be well-supplied for weeks without having to uplt heavy equipment.

It sparked one of the biggest airlts out of a war-zone since the Vietnam war but left thousands of locals stranded in Afghanistan, facing a grim future. Taliban gunmen have launched door-to-door searches for people suspected of having worked with the west in  years of fighting. And many suspects are believed to have been killed as the new rulers of Afghanistan appear to be clamping down with their iron rule nationwide.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people. Participants will discover traditional building skills, learn how to guide visitors, or #takeover# the social media accounts for a museum: all with the aim of improving their future employability.The project, which runs until May , has three main strands of work: providing work experience placements for young people aged - who will study for a Trinity College Arts Award accredited workshops and events and a series of school visits.For more information, contact project co-ordinators Kirsty MacNabat kirsty@chartsargyllandisles.org or Pamela Campbellat pamela@chartsargyllandisles.org.Seymour Adams, Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles Board"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona celebrates double wins","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead golfer Fiona McLeod completed a unique double, winning Dunaverty Golf Club#s R.N.L.I Open Event with a net score of .Fiona#s victory added to her previous success in winning Dunty#s Holiday Open back in July with a net score of .

after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

past few days, but what is the situation in Scotland Long queues and pump closures have wreaked havoc across the UK, but the problems arent actually related to a fuel shortage \"at the source\".Heres what you need to know...Why are there fuel shortages at petrol stations There are numerous reasons for the fuel shortages at petrol stations, but the good news is that there is no fuel shortage \"at the source\" in the UK.Instead, it was alack of HVG drivers that initially meant fuel could not reach a small number of petrol stations around the UK.BP told the UK Government last week that due to a lack of lorry drivers available to deliver fuel, it would prioritise motorway services and limit fuel delivery to keep the supply chain running.As a result, fuel was not delivered to some stations, causing the closure of some pumps.This ledto long queues and then panic buying, with supermarket Sainsburys reportinga surge in demand for fuel over the weekend as people rushed to fill up there cars.According topresident of the AA Edmund King, the shortages could pass in a few dayspeople only filled their cars when they needed and avoided panic purchasing.\"The good news is you can only really fill up once ndash yoursquove got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing,\" he said.\"Itrsquos not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc.\"So, once people have filled up, they wonrsquot travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days.\"He addedthat there\"is plenty of fuel at source\", a statement which has been reiterated by UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Scotlandsdeputy first minister John Swinney.Speaking on Sunday, Shapps said there \"is no shortage of fuel\", whileSwinney said there is an \"adequate supply of fuel to meet normal demand\" in Scotland.What is the government doing to deal with the fuel shortages According to reports, the UK Government is considering easing restrictions on immigration to allow more foreign lorry drivers to come and work in the UK on a temporary basis.A shortage of HVG drivers has been causing problems in dferent sectors over the past few months, with supermarkets also hit.The reported plans have been met with mixed reaction.Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industrydescribed the expected change in rules on visas as a \"huge relief\" but said it was a \"shamethe government needed queues at pumps to move\".However, critics of the plan suggest the government cant expect workers who were forced to leave to rush back on a temporary basis.Andy Prendergast, national officer of the GMB union, told the PA news agency: \"Five years ago this country basically told European truck drivers to get on their bike.\"Now wersquore in a crisis and we are desperate to welcome them back with open arms. Itrsquos no surprise they arenrsquot queuing up to come back to the country that slung them out.\"Changing immigration rules or relaxing driversrsquo tests is not the way to solve the HGV shortage. Paying drivers what they know they are worth, and improving appalling conditions in the industry, is.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-update-today-next-announcement-watch","story":"Nicola Sturgeons weekly update on the Covid situation in Scotlandwill take place in Parliament this afternoon.It comes as children aged - receive lettersthis week inviting them to get a single dose of the Covid vaccine.Numbers in Scotland have been dropping after weeks of high case rates, which the first minister has previously said gives reason for optimism.Last week the Scottish government confirmed that Scotlands rules on internationaltravel will remain in keeping with those of Westminster.It means that from October  there will no longer be a green or amber list, and that travellers from non red-listed countries will not be required to take a test before arriving in Scotland.Heres when Nicola Sturgeons update will take place today and how to watch...When will Nicola Sturgeon speak today The first minister will give an update on the Covid situation in Scotland today at around :pm.The exact time of the speech will depend on the topical questions running to time.How can I watch Nicola Sturgeons update today The update will be broadcast live on Scottish ParliamentTVand streamed via the Scottish Governments social media pages.It will also be live tweeted on the SNPs Twitter.People can watch on BBC Scotland from :pm.What will Nicola Sturgeon say today The first minister willupdate MSPs on the latest numbers regarding Covid in Scotland, including daily case rates, deaths and hospitalisations.With children aged - being invited for vaccination, she is also likely to put out a fresh call encouraging people to take the vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"arla-increases-october-milk-price-producers","story":"Arlas on-account prices for conventional and organic milk are to increase by . euro cents from October , .But this month it will be impacted by a negative . pence per litre quarterly currency adjustment, meaning that when applied to the standard manufacturing litre, Arlarsquos milk price will increase to .ppl for conventional milk and .ppl for organic milk for Arlarsquos farmer owners, an overall . ppl increase.Arla Foods amba board director, and farmer owner, Arthur Fearnall, said: ldquoPricing for all European dairy commodities especially cheese have signicantly increased based on high demand and lower availability during August.

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"new love local

At times, such was the turmoil and ineptitude on display, you would not have left this crew in charge of a rubber duck, never mind a nuclear-powered submarine.Precision was not the point though, this being a piece of fiction. In its favour, Tom Edgersquos drama had a solid gold cast and a strongoccasionally baffling script .Above all, Vigil had pluck and ambition. While this was a tale made for the small screen, the action scenes could have passed muster in a cinema.: No Line of Duty but Jones makes impactWhen we left Amy Silvaat the end of episode it looked as though the jig was up for the DCI.Lamped by a sonar operator who turned out to be an agent for the Russkies, Amy had been stuffed in the same kind of missile casing that had been Martin Compstonrsquos home for the past five weeks. She would have been a goner in the first ten minutessomeone had not walked in on the villain just in time. A lot of that went on in the final hour.Entombed in a tube, all Amy could do was scream for help and think back to the love she had driven away, fellow copper Kirsten , and the daughter who had lost her fatherin a car accident.Eventually, Amy remembered she knew Morse code. As luck would have it, there was someone in the control room who could interpret the messageand with one bound, and a quick vomit, Amy was free to nick the villain.But she had to avoid him killing her first. The chase through the submarine was heart in the mouth stuff, the corridors bathed in red, lights fizzing and flashing.Amy, lithe and muscular, sweating for Scotland in her vest, looked positively Ripleyesque as she hunted the alien presence in her midst.Meanwhile, water was pouring into the boat courtesy of the bad guyrsquos earlier handiwork - he had been a very busy boy - and HMS Vigil was heading for Davy Jonesrsquo locker. The unluckiest submarine in the world looked to be about to meet its fate.But onboard and on shore, the women were not going to let that happen. Though men were predominant, especially at the boss level, it was women who made the key moves, much as in Line of Duty .The men squared off and honour was saved, the anti-Trident MP agreeing to keep quiet ldquothis time. Not before he had a mini rant about getting nukes out of Scotland within his letime, however.It had all been a Russian plot to make the nukes in Scotland seem unsafe and steer MPs into cancelling a replacement deterrent, which sounded a bit rum. Who was to say it would not have had the opposite effect : Was Vigil filmed on a submarine There was no time to worry about any of that because there was hair to be stroked and a relationship to repair.

The NHS is under-resourced and cannot recruit sufficient skilled staff to cope with existing backlogs, let alone the oncoming challenge of winter illnesses exacerbated by Covid. Supermarket shelves have been showing many signs of shortages affecting a iety of products for months.All of this was predicted by those who gave some thought to the potential effects of Brexit, but their views were dismissed as scaremongering by those with another agenda ndash that of extracting the UK from its ties to the EU because of an outdated and misguided notion of \"sovereignty\". Their ill-considered focus was on exaggerating the extent to which \"foreigners\" were dictating our way of le, as a result of our being part of an extendedtrading bloc. The inevitable compromises that every member country had to accept for the benefit of everyone were painted as egregious violations of our way of le.The anti-Europe faction effectively managed to gull a majority of the electorate into believing that we were less British because of the EU. By extension this implied that Germans were less German, and the French were less French by belonging to the EU. Utter nonsense of course, but it held sway in the end, and we are now suffering the consequences of this disastrous decision.It is an interesting insight into the psychology of group-think in the population that a campaign without a single economic fact to support the rhetoric of prosperity outside the EU could persuade a majority to fall in line and vote to take us out of the EU.Nor, since Brexit, have we seen any benefit to GNP in hard currency from outside the EU nor indeed any sign of the promised queue of countries ready to buy our goods and services. The US, our most prized potential trading partner outside the EU, has just relegated us to the end of the queue. The much-heralded, but essentially trling, trade deals we have managed to establish are insignicant in terms of their contribution to our prosperity.The humiliating reality is that in approaching Brexit, our UK politicians were out of their depth with respect to understanding the realities of the economic world, out of their depth in dealing with the EU, but very well versed in the practices of gulling the electorate into believing that they had their interests at heart. A compliant media, and institutions that are not fit for purpose ensured that the Brexit bandwagon was never properly scrutinised and we are now paying the price for that failure.The question now is: does the UK now have the understanding and the political will get us out of the mess Gerry Seenan, Skelmorlie.* WHY have petrol prices jumped  There is no shortage according to Boris Johnson. In North Ayrshire at the weekend it was .p a litre. Remember Mr Johnson said we were heading for the sunny uplands. Did he just forget to mention that we would be walking George Smith, Clydebank.THE SQUANDERING OF OUR WEALTHGUY Stenhouse is thankful the Scottish Government doesnrsquot have the powers to address the current energy crisis, leaving control with Westminster . Thatrsquos gone well. The Tories sold off our national energy companies to private corporations, sacricing energy security and price stability on the altar of profit for a few. They reduced then eliminated taxes on oil and gas companies, foregoing nearly pound billion in revenues, while Norway collected huge tax revenues which itrsquos using to ensure its people welfare.Then therersquos Brexit. When it left the EU energy market believing it could source cheaper energy outside, the UK made itself vulnerable to external shocks as it is no longer protected by the EUrsquos use of linked auctions to balance energy prices. The House of Lords warning in March that energy prices would rise because post-Brexit cross-border trade is less efficient fell on deaf ears.These are the reasons the UK ranks last out of  western European countries on the proportion of homes able to afford adequate heat.With just . per cent of the UK population, Scotland possesses % of the UKrsquos natural wealth including % of oil, % of gas, % of renewable energy generation and % of hydro power. Only the full powers of independence can prevent the UKrsquos ideologically-driven incompetence and greed from squandering more of our wealth.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.BE BOLD ON TAX INCREASESMAY I throw my  kilos behind the calls from Eric Melvin and Doug Maughanfor an emergency budget by the Scottish Government and an increase of at least one penny on higher rates of income tax Although I can already hear the scrape of penknives sharpening quills by the usual suspects, and claims that there will be a mass desertion of higher rate taxpayers to England, there wont be. Like me, they will know that the much higher costs of living south of the Border and the inconvenience of moving will be far outweighed by the benefits of living in a more civilised society in Scotland.Its time for the Scottish Government to be bold. Lets hope they take the opportunity of demonstrating our higher moral standards and get on with it.John Jamieson, Ayr.RAYNER MUST THINK AGAINANGELA Rayner has unwittingly offered a hostage to fortune with her use of the word \"scum\" to describe members of the governing party . She will have to carry that albatross around her neck for some time to come whenever she faces public grillings in the media.Had she made such a comment in the House of Commons, the Speaker would have demanded that she withdraw such an unparliamentary remark. Where the headlines should have concentrated on the meat of her message, that has been eclipsed by the screaming of the word \"scum\" in the ious bulletins. Not only that, but all her colleagues will now be pestered in interviews about their thoughts on her reckless comment.Ms Rayner is undoubtedly a strong and vibrant campaigner for her party with plenty of support behind her, but she may well have seriously dented her prospects of becoming an electable future Labour leader through this careless comment.Any politician worth their salt must acknowledge that political opponents have their principles, eventhey are diametrically contrary to the principles espoused by that politicians party.Clearly what she uttered at that fringe meeting would have been warmly welcomed by the zealots who cannot separate the persons ndash who deserve the dignity of human respect ndash from the policies they advocate, which emphasise the importance of the inidual to the exclusion of the communitarian spirit.She must rise above the pettiness and the hatred embodied in that remarkshe wants her party to regain its place as an electable force worthy of being the governing group in the UK.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.TIME TO TRUST THE TEACHERSCLEARLY the campaign against making le a little easier for trans people is going to rumble on . It will do until Scotland joins those nations which have reformed the process of legal recognition of a persons true sex.We saw exactly the same fear tactics used by those who opposed making the lives of youngLGBTI+ people more tolerable when the then Scottish Executive moved to abolish Section , the law banning the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools as a \"pretended family relationship\". People are naturally concerned when extreme fears are stirred up by those opposed to LGBTI+ human rights. With Section  the supposed fear was that teachers would expose tiny tots to sexually explicit material. Guess what: the fears that were stirred up proved baseless.Now we have a scare that teachers will be suedthey get something wrong in the classroom or do not promote some radical agenda. We should be reassured that our teachers will behave professionally after the reform of the Gender Recognition Act just as they did after the repeal of Section . Those opposed to the rights and welfare of LGBTI+ young people will always try to stir up unfounded fears but let us hope that Scotland as a whole will prove to be more progressive and that the wellbeing of all pupils will be supported.Brian Dempsey, Lecurer in Law, University of Dundee.Read more: This harsh brand of Conservatism is the real threat to the Union"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-grateful-peacemaking-couple-earned-place-history","story":"The late John Hume was one of the few politicians I met at Westminster whom I could count as a lasting friend. I also had the privilege of sharing time with him and Pat on numerous occasions after his retirement, when he suffered from dementia. For several years, Pat was his devoted carer and anyone who has cared for a loved one in that condition will appreciate the dedication, patience and commitment which that entails.My happiest memory of Pat and John was May , , when the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people of Ireland in a referendum. I had dinner that evening in the company of Pat and John, who introduced me to Bishop Edward Daly. That evoked terrible memories of the same priest, the younger Father Daly who, in the face of lethal gunfire, was pictured waving a blood-stained handkerchief while courageously trying to administer the last rites to one of the victims of the Bloody Sunday massacre in . That iconic image, which was seen by millions of people throughout the world, became an international symbol of the suffering of the people of Ireland.More than a quarter of a century later, on that memorable May evening, there was a hope that Ireland at last was on the cusp of a new era, where the people of Ireland would live together in peace and harmony, whatever their religion or politics.

They even put up with a terrible risk when the nuclear reactor is switched on ndash they are given iodine tablets as a precaution.

Situated just outside Irvine, the hotelrsquos , square metre Si! Spa has recently reopened following a pound million makeover.We arrived on a rainy Sunday and headed straight for the thermal suite, a stylish relaxation area that includes a sauna, steam room, rainforest shower, and vitality pool. With atmospheric lighting and my phone locked away in the changing room, I was so relaxed that I nearly missed my scheduled spa treatment ndasha massage and facial that used luxury Espa and Ishga products.Suffering from the kind of upper backache that most of the home-working kitchen table workforce will sympathise with, I hoped that a deep tissue massage would leave me feeling refreshed. That was exactly what I got, with the combination of hot stones and firm pressure banishing my backache after just half an hour. Then came a facial and therapeutic scalp ritual which left me with delightfully glowing skin.From there, we headed outside to the hotelrsquos open-air spa experience, with custom-built decking offering views over the golf course and a collection of sun loungers in case the sun made an unexpected appearance.We were delighted to have the sunken outdoor hot tub to ourselves, enjoying that sensation of feeling smug and warm within the water despite the weather being decidedly chilly. Thinking the spa experience was over we started to head back inside, but the lovely staff brought out a sorbet and a fresh fruit smoothie which we enjoyed under the glow of the in-built heaters.We then headed back to our room ndash a conveniently short walk from both the spa and restaurant ndash where we changed for dinner in the hotelrsquos Coast restaurant. Fortunately, we opted for loose-fitting options as the portions were some of the most generous I have ever been served. A starter of salt and chilli-battered chicken included six huge pieces of chicken breast, while the prawn cocktail had two dozen prawns and plenty of bread. No scrimping on portions here.For our mains we opted for a butter chicken curry , and a buttermilk chicken burger . Both were delicious.Our waiter, Frazer, was incredibly friendly and reassuringly attentive when it came to my nut allergy, which I had flagged up when we booked the trip. He had checked with the kitchen that every ingredient I was being served was nut-free, meaning I could relax into my food coma without any allergy concerns.And despite the big portions, I manged to valiantly order a dessert of Baked Alaska, made with Isle of Arran white chocolate ice cream. It was every bit as indulgent as I hoped for.Breakfast the next morning was one of the best wersquove ever tasted: creamy scrambled egg, vegetarian sausages, potato scones, beans, tomatoes and freshly-squeezed orange juice. We left feeling refreshed, recharged, and wondering how soon we could justiably book another spa break.Supporting around  local jobs, SimpsInns has invested over pound.m across its portfolio of venues around the Ayrshire coast to enhance the quality and overall visitor experience.

They can appear fragile, vulnerable even, on the edge and cut off from the mainland. But those same circumstances can also foster resilience, community strength and self-sufficiency. In past centuries, island living was often thought to be behind the times compared to the mainland ndash but now the tables have turned and many island communities are leading the way in sustainability.Living in a city, food appears in the shops and rubbish and recycling material magically disappear with the council lorries ndash itrsquos all very convenient. However this makes it easier to ignore all the players in the supply chains that bring goods to us, as well as the environmental impact of what we discard. Not so on islands.When everything you buy arrives by ferry and rubbish has to leave the same wayit is perhaps not surprising that island communities are forging new, more environmentally friendly paths ndash with active sharing economies, clean energy and inspirational community initiatives.For many Scottish islands a turning point has been community ownership. Across the country it has been shown communities able to take responsibility for managing their own assets make decisions that benefit and protect the land they steward. Islands Secretary Mairi Gougeon is keen to build on the sustainability successes of island communities in Scotlandrsquos journey to net zero.In a recent release she stated that: ldquoWe know that our islands are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change but also have huge potential and natural capital that will help us meet our net zero ambition.ldquoIsland communities are already engaged and acting to cut emissions and our commitment to make at least three of our islands carbon neutral by  will seek to build on work already underway.ldquoSupporting islands to become carbon neutral will help protect their unique heritage, culture and bioersity, while also delivering on our commitment to support island communities to flourish economically and socially.ISLE OF EIGGThe Isle of Eigg led the way in community ownership and is now often visited by researchers from around the world aiming to learn from the successes of this independent island community.The islanders bought their island in  for pound. million from the eccentric German artist Professor Murama.Ten thousand members of the general public contributed to the buyout fund, which successfully placed the ownership of the island in the hands of The Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust ndash a partnership between the residents of Eigg, The Highland Council and the Scottish Wildle Trust.In  Eigg launched an off-grid electricity system powered by wind, water and solar ndash a world first.The systems included four wind turbines, a hydro scheme on the Laig river and solar , replacing the noisy, polluting diesel generators that households previously relied on. Eigg Electric is community-owned, managed and maintained.Eigg is also supported by conservation volunteers and, despite missing them this year, , trees were planted in early .Eigg today is a dynamic and successful island. The population continues to rise, with many young people raised on the island choosing toto start businesses and bring up families. There is an impressive creative lsquocan-dorsquo spirit.Undaunted by their small size or location the island hosts music festivals, artist residencies and therersquos even a record company ndash Lost Map Records ndash run by Johnny Lynch ndash aka Pictish Trail.Eigg will soon be home to Scotlandrsquos first co-operative brewery, after The Isle of Eigg Brewery raised pound, through a membership scheme.Once operational % of the profits will also be dedicated to local small businesses start-ups and community initiatives.For Eigg, community ownership has allowed the residents to shape the way they want to look after this beautul island- theyrsquove built homes through a community construction firm, brought in speedy WiFi improving job prospects, banned visitor cars and welcomed new families to the island.ISLE OF GIGHATHE Isle of Gigha, off the west coast of Kintyre, was successfully bought by the community and handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Truston March ,  ndash and just as on Eigg the handover anniversary is now a day of celebration.The Scottish Land Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise helped raise the pound million required. Despite some financially bumpy patches over the past  years, the island is now thriving with a growing population.IGHT oversees both Gigha Green Power and Gigha Renewable Energy, which both operate wind turbines on the island.A Gigha Community Fund invests income from the renewable energy back into the community ndash funding initiatives to improve health, develop skills, relieve poverty and conserve the environment.ISLE OF RUMNeighbouring island to Eigg, Rum has been partially owned by the community since . Previously Scottish Natural Heritagewas responsible for the entire island, which meant most stable jobs were tied to the work of the organisation.Residents and the SNH agreed giving the community independence would lead to a more stable population on the island, with capacity for growth.All  adults voted in favour of the transfer, and the Isle of Rum Community Trusttook ownership of the village of Kinloch, including all of the homes, farm buildings and surrounding land.The IRCT aims to manage the community land for the benefit of the community, while protecting the natural environment of this wildle-rich island. Four new IRCT homes have now been built and others refurbished, giving this island a more sustainable future.ISLE OF ULVAUlva, off the west coast of Mull, is the newest island to achieve community ownership, completing the transfer in June . The North West Mull Community Woodland Company now owns the island, a purchase helped by a grant from the Scottish Land Fund worth pound. million and following the approval of a Community Right to Buy application.The immediate aims for Ulva are repopulation and improving the services on the island for residents and visitors. Much of the existing housing stock was extremely dilapidated now six properties are currently being renovated as well as the pier. Green energy is part of the plan too ndash Ulva is collaborating with other small islands across Europe to bid for funding to undertake a clean energy transition, and is working with an energy consultant to identy appropriate strategies for the island.Two new electric vehicles are now in operation too. At the time of the buy out the population was only five people. However an appeal for new residents in  prompted hundreds of people to apply to move to the island.A couple from Edinburgh moved to re-open the islandrsquos Boathouse cafeacute last spring, and many more potential islanders are ready to join them in future. In the s Ulva was home to more than  people and, while a much slower population growth is planned now, itrsquos clear the future is brighter than ever on Ulva."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-launches-new-improved-online-puzzles","story":"Whether you want to play on your device or with a printable version, The Herald has introduced new games To our fantastic puzzles section, including Jigsaw, Number Jig, Quick Crossword and more.Herald subscribers have exclusive access to our puzzles section, and we add more than  every week.As a subscriber, youll have access to The Heraldrsquos fun and challenging puzzle section, updated every day with quizzes, crosswords, puzzles and much more.

The impact on the unemployment rate could be +.%. In Glasgow this would equate to a loss of pound.m per annum and the loss of  jobs.Graeme Blackett of BiGGAR Economics agrees there is no question that the lack of housing is an issue for the Scottish economy but pointed out that it is a problem for every advanced economy, even those where the tourism sector is not as large as it is in Scotland.ldquoThat suggests tourism is not the main driver of the housing problem, he said. ldquoThe consensus amongst most economists is that there is not enough supply ndash we donrsquot build enough houses - so regulations are not going to solve the problem.Mr Blackett said any regulations would come with a cost.ldquoThey donrsquot exist yet so it is not possible to be certain about the effects, but we can look at how such things affect the economy to give us some sort of guidance andit puts up prices, which it is likely to do, you would expect that to reduce demand.ldquoThe other consequence you would expect to happenthere is a regulation system is that it will put off some hosts.He said some would be likely to question whether the regulation was worth spending money on while others might be put off by the ldquohassle of going through the process.ldquoIf there is a reduction in demand and a reduction in properties there will be fewer visitors staying in Airbnb which means there will be less money spent in the economy by guests and Hosts, said Mr Blackett.ldquoIf you do something that impacts on prices then it will have an economic effect. It does not really matter how much it is as any sort of cost will increase prices. Any regulation will have a cost and that will feed its way through and the question is whether people will think that cost is worth it.ldquoIt might be thata price goes up by % it will make no dference to most people but it will to some and they wonrsquot come any more so you will see the effect in terms of lower demand.Mr Blackett said people would either not come at all or would have less money to spend in local shops, restaurants and businesses because they were spending more of it on accommodation as they would be paying indirectly for the regulation.ldquoThe key point about the report is it provides some evidence of what the consequences would be of less activity, he said. ldquoIt is then up to the people who are proposing and voting on the legislation to look at the downside as well as whatever problem they hope to solve so they can balance those things and decide whether it is a sensible thing to do.Under the new proposals, short-term lets, hosts may have to pay almost pound, just to comply with new regulations, making it the most expensive short-term lets regime in Europe.Hosts might also face costly home alterations, such as replacing wooden floors with lino.ldquoContrary to popular myth, Airbnb is actually a strong advocate for sensible proportionate regulation and has entered into over  tax and regulatory agreements worldwide so this is not new to us, said Amanda Cupples, Airbnb General Manager for Northern Europe.ldquoHowever these proposals are among the strictest in the world and incredibly costly. The majority of Hosts on Airbnb in Scotland actually share their own home and the average earnings per year are around pound. However the regulations as drafted mean that whether you share your spare room for one night or your entire property, you need to apply for a licence that could cost you up to pound. This is really disproportionate. In this post-pandemic phase, a lot of Hosts on Airbnb rely on that additional income to make ends meet so we want to do the right thing by them.As well as being in favour of registration for those letting out their properties, Airbnb has a neighbourhood support hotline and a range of other tools available to local authorities and communities to help them manage tourism.*BiGGAR Economics Report ldquoScottish  Local Tourism Economic Impact Assessment, October , commissioned by Airbnb.This article is brought to you in partnership with Airbnb."},{"url":null,"title":"greenock-morton-officially-fan-owned-morton-club-together-finalise-ownership","story":"Fan membership organisation Morton Club Together , which has  members, has increased its stake in the Championship side from  per cent to a little under  per cent, thus taking majority ownership.The move concludes a process two and a half years in the making for the Greenock club, with MCT members contributing pound a month to the organisation.MCT founder Graham McLennan admitted that the road to becoming a fan-owned club has been arduous but not that it has been traversed, he predicted a brighter future for the second tier side.ldquoSince launch day, MCT has been about bringing people together, he told Mortonrsquos website.ldquoWithout our fellow MCT members and the ongoing efforts and support of so many people inside and outside MCT, the change already delivered at Morton and the opportunities created to continue to move Morton forward would simply not be possible.The @TonClubTogether takeover of Greenock Morton Football Club has been completed.We are now a community owned club!https:t.co GqxzPIpYx pic fMsBdAUABldquoI will never stop being humbled, amazed and thankful to every single person who continues to come forward to support and help MCT and Morton.ldquoWe are all in this equally and together we will continue to work hard, openly and respectfully, as we all share a love for Morton and the community within which it operates, and always will.ldquoWe could say that we are now just arriving at the starting line of a new era, with an exciting journey ahead. Of course, there are huge challenges to be addressed as we strive to achieve the best Morton possible, and power in people numbers has never been so important.ldquoBy sticking together and continuing to welcome new members into MCT, I am confident that what Morton will achieve is potentially incredible.The long-standing relationship between Golden Caskethas been brought to a close now that the takeover has been concluded, with outgoing chairman Crawford Rae ndash son of former chair Douglas ndash expressing his belief that the move to fan ownership is a momentous day for the team.ldquoA new chapter in the history of Greenock Morton Football Club officially starts today, he wrote.ldquoThe supporters have dreamt of community ownership for many years, however until MCT came along, we honestly did not see this becoming a reality.ldquoGraham McLennan founded MCT and put together a group of amazing people who between them have a huge wealth of experience. There is always strength in numbers but far greater strength is achieved with a collective goodwill which MCT delivers in abundance.ldquoThere is no better legacy for the Rae family than to afford the fans the opportunity of community ownership which is why we decided to gt MCT our majority shareholding as opposed to selling to a third party. The vision that MCT displayed to our family convinced us that community ownership was the best option for the future success of Greenock Morton Football Club and the right time for us to step aside.ldquoThe last  years have been a rollercoaster of emotions for every member of the Rae family, we have met some great characters and made many good friends along the way. We could not have done any of this without the undying support of the Morton fans who have been the backbone of our team. For their contribution we will be eternally grateful.ldquoWe have been assisted by so many fine people who have thrown their weight behind the task, giving of their time for nothing and we take this opportunity to thank them all for their tower of strength and friendship during our tenure.ldquoWe are forever Morton supporters and wish everyone great success for the future of the football club."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September ,  at : pmOrkney’s artists and craftmakers are being encouraged to apply for a funding scheme, administered by Orkney Islands Council.

She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

By gathering as much information as we can, we will be able to help people and dogs live the best lives possible together.”The online survey asks dog owners about everything from how their dog behaves and what training they do with their four-legged friend, to questions about their relationship such as do they celebrate their dog’s birthday and do they tell them they love them. It also covers people’s post-pandemic plans for their dog such as are they hoping to take them into the office with them or will they employ a dog walker,they are ing to their workplace.The survey, which can be completed online at www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk, also asks people to say how having a dog improves their le, what advice they would give to people looking to welcome a dog into their family and what one thing could Dogs Trust do to help them and their dog live happily together.Conor adds:“We always love to hear tales from owners who have adopted from us, and every single one of them has a dferent story to tell. We now want to capture the experiences of all local dog owners so we can build a picture of dog ownership today and what more Dogs Trust can do to help them and their dogs.“This will be the most comprehensive census of dogs and dog lovers ever completed and we would love iteveryone who is passionate about dogs could do their bit to help our four-legged friends of the future have the best lives possible.“What people tell us today will help us make sure we are able to do everything we can to support dogs and their owners for the next  years and more.”For more information and to take part in the National Dog Survey, visit www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk Dog owners who complete the survey will get tailored behaviour advice sent direct to them.

I know there was signicant demand earlier, the issues have been resolved and the applications are now progressing through our system.”A spokesperson for the department said that they are working hard to fix the technical issues on the website.“We always knew demand for the Spend Local card would be extremely high, which is why we are giving people four weeks to apply,” they said.“Please be patient there is plenty of time for everyone to apply, receive and use their Spend Local card.”Mr Lyons advised that “not everybody has to rush at once” to apply and that the verication messages were being sent “in a staged process just to make sure the website isn’t overwhelmed all at once”.“There is a card available for everyone that is eligible, so I would encourage people to apply for that over the coming weeks,” he told the BBC.The Belfast ’s Facebook page was inundated with comments about people experiencing dficulties operating the online system.One person said that the website had crashed as early as .am and that they had tried three times to apply and received no email response.“Another example of exemplary NI Civil Service standards in how NOT to roll out a computer system,” said one disappointed user.“Waste of time.

Good start,” said another.One of our readers said that they waited three and a half hours to receive an email and still received no response. “I then tried the NI Direct website, but it just crashed again. If we treated our customers like this, we would have no business,” they said.There were, however, a few lucky ones who managed to submit their application relatively pain-free.One said they “got it easy enough, only took a few minutes”. Emily Townsley said that at the very start, she submitted her email and  minutes later received a link but experienced a slight dficulty before finally submitting an application.“I tried to click on it and went very slow but half an hour later it went through to the application, once I filled it all out I clicked finish and it came up failed API call so I left it until pm and got another email sent to me and clicked it on and only took one minute and went through.”From successful application submission, it is anticipated that you will receive your voucher within seven to  days.The deadline for applications is October  and the cut-off for spending the card is November .A phone line is due to open in two weeks’ time, on Monday October , for those having dficulty using the online system.Iniduals can also apply on behalf of up to three people. It is open to anyone over the age of  living in Northern Ireland.Read MoreNI High Street voucher scam warningRelated topicsDepartment for the EconomyGordon LyonsSinn FéinMore On Department for the Economy PremiumYoung people ‘not equipped’ to succeed in the workplace PremiumLess than a third of Covid support grants wrongly handed out by Stormont department edNI High Street voucher scam warningEconomy Minister Gordon Lyons urged to extend Covid payment to all NI students in GB and IrelandLabour market in great shape but economist warns ‘headwinds intensying’Most ReadFuel crisis: Asda imposes £ cap at  NI filling stationsSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursWatch: Attempted theft of moped in BelfastArrest after Belfast Andersonstown Road serious crashTop VideosPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest CoronavirusRight move, now back us: Social distancing move welcomed but some feel left in ‘no-man’s land’Lisa SmythOpinionMore mixed messaging and confusion when a strong public health message is necessaryMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSwann calls for vaccine passports to be ‘on the books’ as four deaths and , cases reportedRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchLatestNo time to wait: NI Bond superfan on why he thinks the spy series needs to be shaken and stirredTape of  John Lennon interview sold at auction for £,Lashana Lynch hopes No Time To Die will inspire young women and girls of colourTaiwan’s politicians brawl after opposition rushes the podiumAlex KaneOpinionUnionist leaders must put their egos aside to maintain the Union,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

AFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueShoppers wearing protective face coverings to combat the spread of the coronavirus walk through Belfast city centre. Olivia FletcherSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailRetail bosses in Northern Ireland have largely welcomed advice from the Executive to remove social distancing requirements in shops, theatres and some other indoor venues – but some want more backing from the Executive when it comes to policing vaccination status and negative Covid tests.Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, has described the removal of the one metre social distancing requirement as a “step forward”.But while Movie House boss, Michael McAdam, is glad that cinemas will soon be able to open at full capacity, he has said it is “completely unfair” on his staff to have to police the venue using the advice given to them by the Executive.Guidance given to some indoor venues such as cinemas includes asking customers to produce proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test.He said: “I#m fearful because there’s no legal requirement to do this.”Anda customer refuses to show an employee proof of vaccination or a negative test, Michael McAdam told the Belfasthe would advise the employee to let them in because he “wouldn#t have any member put themselves in that kind of danger” and, without legal backing from the Executive, “we have no right to stop” people who refuse to give proof, he said.Mr McAdam went on to say: “It#s a very dficult one for us. Andwe were going to go down the route of passports, then we would have the strength and the knowledge and the backup of authorities. But at the present time with what#s being proposed, it leaves us with a no-man’s-land approach.”He has echoed sentiment from SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, who has said that not introducing vaccine passports for some indoor venues is “astounding and reckless”.Health Minister Robin Swann also said he did not support new proposals because the scheme was neither agreed nor ready”, and has also called for a domestic vaccine certication scheme to be put in place.But Mr Roberts said: “The situation is obviously first and foremost for the customer or the shopper to make sure they comply with all the existing regulations and that still means sanitising hands and wearing face covers. That is the current law on the current regulations, so they#ll have to continue to be observed, but I think that this takes a little bit of pressure all retailers.”The Retail NI boss, who is in England attending the Labour Party conference, said: “Where I am now in Brighton, it seems almost a dferent world away from where Belfast is, and I think there#s no reason that we can#t make progress providing it#s done in a safe way that obviously doesn’t put public health at risk.”And the head of Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland, Roger Pollen, said: “The removal of the social distancing requirement for certain indoor venues, which will enable those businesses to operate on a more normal basis, is a welcome step forward.“For some venues, such as theatres, concert halls and cinemas, this relaxation is in tandem with guidance to require proof of vaccination, a negative Covid test or proof of natural immunity.“While this is guidance, and has not been placed on a statutory footing, we recognise this as good practice. It has been demonstrated at recent large events such as Belsonic and the Balmoral Show, that putting in place such measures can enable people to come together safely and for events to pass off successfully.”With thousands of bookings at Movie House for the new James Bond film, Mr McAdam said: “For people who have booked, they don#t have to be concerned in the week ahead because social distancing as it was yesterday and as it is until Thursday will still be implemented.”Meanwhile, Julia Corkey, chief executive of ICC Belfast, Waterfront Hall and Ulster Hall, said: “We remain committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all visitors and will implement robust Covid-secure procedures to ensure this is the case. To this end, all ticketholders attending events at our venues will be required to complete a Covid Status Check on arrival at the venue.”And Brona Moffett, head of experience and enterprise development at National Museums NI, said: “We view the end of social distancing as a positive update as it will increase capacity across our sites, meaning more people can enjoy our museums.“However, safety remains paramount across each of our sites as our visitor feedback to date has given us confidence and clarity that our guests feel comfortable when enjoying our spaces. With this in mind, we’ll continue to encourage and facilitate hand sanitising, good ventilation and the use of our one-way systems where possible.”Related topicsColum EastwoodRobin SwannMore On Colum EastwoodSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsHospitality Ulster claims no consultation on SDLP vaccine passport plan, as Eastwood says he spoke to we and others PremiumSDLP delays annual conference as Covid rates remain high PremiumMy friend Pat Hume played a crucial role in peace process, says Daphne Trimble PremiumTD calls for cross-border ‘John Hume University’ in north west but Department says ‘no need’ for itMost ReadFuel crisis: Asda imposes £ cap at  NI filling stationsSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursWatch: Attempted theft of moped in BelfastArrest after Belfast Andersonstown Road serious crashTop VideosPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest CoronavirusLisa SmythOpinionMore mixed messaging and confusion when a strong public health message is necessaryMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSwann calls for vaccine passports to be ‘on the books’ as four deaths and , cases reportedRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsLatestAssembly calls for governments to probe Troubles collusion claimsNo time to wait: NI Bond superfan on why he thinks the spy series needs to be shaken and stirredNo Time To Die director says Bond film was always intended for the big screenTape of  John Lennon interview sold at auction for £,Lashana Lynch hopes No Time To Die will inspire young women and girls of colour,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PADavid YoungSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Executive has decided to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and some other indoor settings in Northern Ireland. At a meeting on Monday night, ministers decided to remove the one-metre distance requirement for the retail sector, indoor attractions and seated indoor venues.However, ministers were split on vaccine certication and over guidance to business and venue owners to mitigate the impact of allowing ato full capacity.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused the DUP and Sinn Fein of making an “astounding and reckless” decision to oppose moves to introduce certication in light of winter pressures on health services. First Minister Paul Givan tweeted: “Progress made after a constructive meeting of the Executive to remove social distancing requirements for indoor seated venues, indoor visitor attractions and retail settings.“Guidance will be provided for measures that can be taken to mitigate risk.”The measures are to take effect from pm on Thursday. Further consideration is to be given to the hospitality sector on October .The Executive said that despite the social distancing requirement being removed, “we would ask people to keep close face to face contact to a minimum at all times”.An Executive statement said: “The Executive has today considered the existing regulations and has agreed to remove the legal requirement to socially distance in retail and indoor visitor attractions.“We ask that those responsible for these venues, and those attending them, continue to utilise all other available mitigations such as hand sanitising, good ventilation, and using one way systems where possible. The wearing of a face covering remains a legal requirement in these settings.“The Executive has also decided to remove the requirement to socially distance in indoor seated venues such as theatres, concert halls and cinemas.”The advice includes the installation of screening, one-way systems and increased ventilation. Ministers will issue additional guidance to indoor seated venues advising that they introduce entry policies that require proof of either Covid- vaccination, a negative lateral flow test or evidence of a positive PCR test within the previous six months.However, ministers were split on this. The SDLP’s Nichola Mallon opposed the move to only advise that indoor seated venues ask for Covid certication or negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the last six months.Ms Mallon proposed that the steps be mandatory. She also wanted the measure beefed up to mean patrons had to show vaccine certication and a negative lateral flow test or proof of infection in the last six months.Alliance Justice Minister Naomi Long supported this but the other ministers, including Health Minister Robin Swann, voted against it.When it came to the vote on the original proposal to make the recommendations in guidance only, Ms Mallon voted against and Ms Long abstained. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood said: “It is astounding and reckless that DUP and Sinn Féin Ministers have kicked the can down the road instead of bringing certainty and clarity.“Their decision not to put vaccine certications in regulation but instead to remove social distancing requirements and advise businesses to opt in is totally irresponsible. Not only does this offer no incentive for vaccination, it puts the onus entirely on businesses themselves. This is a cop out and another failure of leadership.”Ministers will not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector until next week. Four further deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid- were reported here on Monday, along with  new confirmed cases.Related topicsSDLPSinn FéinColum EastwoodNichola MallonPaul GivanAlliance PartyNaomi LongRobin SwannMore On SDLP PremiumViewpointOpinionPacts feed into the democratic deficitCoveney set to be sent to Northern Ireland centenary church service in Armagh PremiumDUP at : Started off as a protest party before becoming part of the political establishment, but is it now turning full circle Derry GP handed -month suspension over Covid misinformation PremiumSDLP delays annual conference as Covid rates remain highMost ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursFuel crisis: Asda imposes £ cap at  NI filling stationsSocial distancing ends in shops and theatres, but ministers split over vaccine passportsWatch: Attempted theft of moped in BelfastArrest after Belfast Andersonstown Road serious crashTop VideosPlayVideo: Man smashes car with weapon in Belfast attackPlayVideo: Attempted theft of Deliveroo man#s scooter before being chased off in Belfast shopping centre car parkPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest CoronavirusRight move, now back us: Social distancing move welcomed but some feel left in ‘no-man’s land’Lisa SmythOpinionMore mixed messaging and confusion when a strong public health message is necessaryMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSwann calls for vaccine passports to be ‘on the books’ as four deaths and , cases reportedRevealed: Nearly , pupils caught Covid after ing in MarchLatestLashana Lynch hopes No Time To Die will inspire young women and girls of colourTaiwan’s politicians brawl after opposition rushes the podiumAlex KaneOpinionUnionist leaders must put their egos aside to maintain the UnionDaniel Craig gets royal send-off as No Time To Die premiere brings out the starsPhoebe Waller-Bridge shares thoughts on female Bond,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

Rosemount Resource Centre hosting a range of events in support ofInternational Older Peoplersquos Day on  October.Reporter: Nicole Lang Sept   addthis, In May this year, The Rosemont Resource Centre opened the doors of its brand-new building, funded by the Department for Communities. Since then, they have hosted a range of activities and events and provided supportive services to those who need it within the community, particularly the elderly. Jean Martin, Project Manager at the centre says the services are vital to the community, especially the elderly community, “Covid has caused a lot of social isolation within the elderly community. A lot of older people feel left behind. googletag.cmd.push “The world is changing and so much is online. We are hoping to support as many older people as we can, eventhey just need a pint of milk or a friendly face to talk to.” The centre is currently carrying out a pilot scheme called ‘Good Morning Rosemount,’ in conjunction with St Joseph’s Secondary School. The pilot scheme has ious programmes which include a Walking Group every Monday night at pm, Chair Aerobics which starts  October at am and ArtTherapy whichwill begin Thursday  October at am. The centre is also hoping to support those applying for the pound High Street Voucher Scheme who do not have the means to apply online.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

ONEILLS DERRY SFC ROUND  Slaughtneil -Swatragh - The -point winning margin saw Paul Bradleys side finish in second spot behind Lavey, with the Davitts dropping to third on score dference.With ongoing maintenance on their main pitch at Davitt Park, Swatragh have been playing on their training pitch and while it was in pristine condition, its tight confines made it dficult to find space.Swatragh were more aggressive on their press and limited Antoacutein McMullan to just one short kick-out and a  percent first-half retention rate. A possession won by Fionnbharr McGuigan was the only break won with the rest coming from frees awarded for pushes in a congested middle third.At the other end, Sean McNicholl had marginally more freedom and kicked excellently throughout, losing just two kick-outs over the hour.Kevin Madden handed Michael Friel a first start of the championship and stationed him at corner forward, where he was picked up by Brendan Rogers. Karl McKaigue went across to Francis Kearney, with Peadar Kearney on Fintan McGurk.Oisin McWilliams wore number , but started at midfield where Chrissy McKaigue lined up against him. In the reshuffle, Cahal Murray started at centre forward where he pulled to the wings and the centre of Slaughtneils defence was manned by the rotation of Patsy Bradley and Padraig Cassidy.It left Slaughtneil needing a high concentration level to balance a compact centre with Cassidy getting forward to punch holes in Swatraghs defence. Brendan Rogers also had a major impact on the game and got forward at every opportunity.At the other end, Sean Francis Quinn picked up Christopher Bradley, who played slightly ahead of Shane McGuigan and Brian Cassidy. Sean Tad Cassidy and Seaacuten Oacute Caiside were alternating on Slaughtneils right wing against James Kearney and Niall Coyle. Oacute Caiside was later forced off with a suspected torn cruciate ligament injury.On the other wing, Keelan Feeney got on enough ball to keep Sean Martin Quinn out of the game. His case wasnt helped by not having a gumshield and Barry Cassidy let him re-enter the fray with one in situ.Feeney and McGrath combined on the left wing for Shane McGuigan to get a run on Diarmuid Dillon and fist over the first score of the game and the Emmets doubled their lead with a confident Sammy Bradley point at the end of a Rogers foray upfield.Midway through the first-half, a McMullan kick-out was punched back into the Slaughtneil defence where Chrissy McKaigue saw black for taking down the galloping Oisin McWilliams.Three minutes later a Diarmuid Dillon body check on Brian Cassidy also saw him in the sin-bin and it opened the game up.A close-range Meehaul McGrath goal after the water break put Slaughtneil - to - ahead. After Rogers and Padraig Cassidy ran at the Swatragh defence, McGrath was calm enough to sidestep in a crowded penalty area before slotting to the net.Slaughtneils game of closing down the midfield involved players dropping off to the closest man, but when Sean Cassidy lost his footing Sean Francis Quinn came forward to kick a point with the outside of his right boot.Peadar Kearney, who escaped an earlier yellow card, was walking a fine line after another foul on Fintan McGurk who was Swatraghs most potent forward. James Kearney missed the free, but when Conor McAtamney won the next kick-out, McGurk went through to make it a three-point game, - to -.The Swa then had a goal chance, started by Francis Kearney and involving McGurk, that saw Kearneys low shot blocked by the feet of Rogers. Oisin McWilliams and Francis Kearneyalso missed chances to eat into the lead before half-time.Friel started the second-half at centre-forward and after an early Christopher Bradley wide, Francis Kearney hit Swatraghs only point of the second-half from a free.Seven minutes into the half, a well-worked move involving Rogers, McGrath and Sammy Bradley saw Shane McGuigan in on goal, where he was fouled and referee Cassidy awarded a penalty. Sean McNicholl saved McGuigans first attempt, but only into the Slaughtneil man path and he finished the rebound to the net.McNicholl worked the kick-out short and an Oisin McWilliams run up the right flank pulled Slaughtneil out of position and when the ball was squared, Cahal Murray palmed to the net at the far post, making the score - to - in the visitors favour after  minutes.Swatragh had a spell with the McWilliams twins inside, but Murrays goal was their last score of the game. With limited space, the diagonal ball wasnt an option and anytime it was played in straight, Rogers was able to come from behind to turnover the ball.McMullan was able to poke some of his kick-outs to Feeney and slowly but surely Slaughtneil got a firm grip on the game.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Sept   addthis, The Churches Trust celebrated four years of their flagship youth project ‘Community of Homes’ this week with the launch of a very colourful ‘Creativity and Wellbeing’ book. The book depics the wonderful work of the young people involved and showing how creative pathways contributed to personal development in what has been trying times over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push Held at St. Columb’s Park House, the Mayor, Graham Warke, representatives from Department for Communities, Derry and Strabane District Council, local community groups and schools who took part, all listened intently as Churches Trust CEO, Fiona Fagan praised the young people who took part in the project and described the four year journey as ‘one that has been enriching for all involved.’ ‘This successful programme of creativity and well-being is a celebration of four years hard work by these young people especially through the dficult Covid period. It is also testament to their resilience as we, hopefully, come out of the pandemic and see brighter days ahead,’ commented Ms. Fagan. The project was funded by Department for Communities within their ‘Uniting Communities’ programme which funds projects that promote good relations and reconciliation through sports and creativity by addressing barriers to community participation. Churches Trust worked in collaboration with The Art Smyth, Ardnashee School and College, St. Joseph’s Boys School, and Lisneal and St. Mary’s Colleges. The celebratory event was funded by the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council through the Community Relations and Cultural Diversity grants programme. Fiona also thanked core funders Community Relations Council, Derry City and Strabane District Council, and Inner City Trust. Speaking after last week’s event, Kathryn Hill, Director of Active Communities in the Department for Communities commented:     “I was delighted to have been invited along today to join in celebrating the launch of the Churches Trust’s Community of Homes, Creativity and Wellbeing book. “The Department has funded the Community of Homes project in recent years though our Together: Building a United Community Uniting Opportunities grant scheme, a good relations programme delivered through the medium of sport, physical and creative activity. “This project has engaged young people in a unique range of creative activities that brings communities together, addresses barriers to participation and increases social skills. “I want to thank Fiona and the Churches Trust for successfully delivering this project and most importantly the young people that have taken part.” Showcase Wednesday’s book launch also included the showcasing of seven youth projects involving over  young people each year from local schools, churches and communities. Many of the youth project are structured using the creative pathways: all projects are underpinned by good relations, personal development and skills development. Projects range from ongoing one-to-one mentoring programmes, to summer camps, to small groups working on themed ad hoc projects and to larger groups who engage in three-six month programmes. Speakers at the event included the Mayor, Graham Warke Kathryn Hill, Department for Communities, artist Sinead Smyth, Faustina Starrett, North West Regional College, and the Churches Trust’s own Catherine Coyle who delivered an address on the success of the four year programme.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council were last night meeting to discuss the future of Portstewart Town Hall after an audit earlier this year raised questions over its ownership. googletag.cmd.push In April, the Council reported that the NI Audit Office was unable to raty its   accounts, citing ownership issues over three buildings in the Borough. “In recent days, we have been made aware that Councils financial statements include signicant buildings that the Council has no proof and title to,” said an Audit Office statement read at a meeting. Council agreed at a Land and Property Services Committee meeting in February to hand the building back to its historic landowners the Montagu Estate, and had taken legal advice on the issue. A special meeting due to take place tonight will see the public excluded from viewing proceedings, with a decision taken to hold the meeting privately in committee. The decision has disappointed local residents group Portstewart Community Association, who have launched an online petition to persuade the Council to pause all legal action. “We have been challenging the decision taken by councillors to hand Portstewart Town Hall back to the Montague Estate, who have claimed historical ownership of the building,” they said. “We are disappointed that the council do not appear to have challenged this claim, despite the council being in possession of Portstewart Town Hall since .     “Following a request from Portstewart Community Association, the Council is meeting on Monday  September to discuss the matter of Portstewart Town Hall. “Unfortunately, this meeting is being held in committee, meaning that we, the public, will be unable to listen to or participate in this meeting. “We are again asking councillors to vote to pause all legal proceedings in relation to Portstewart Town Hall. “Without this vote, the legal proceedings will continue as per the previous Council decision, and the Town Hall will be lost to the people of Portstewart.” The petition has been signed by  people to date, with the Council due to meet this evening at .pm.  Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.    Sinn Feacutein councillor denied permission to speak after fool comment  A point of order was called by DUP councillors Adrian McQuillan and William Duddy.    No budget yet agreed for Councils proposed air show in   Discussion on the event prompted heated exchanges during the Leisure and Development Committee.

However, Mr Durkan noted his disappointment that the Bill as it currently stands fails to protect people vulnerable to gambling related harm. He has demanded regulation both North and South to protect , problem gamblers. googletag.cmd.push Speaking ahead of the Second Stage of the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill, the Foyle MLA said: “Gambling addiction has been a scourge within our communities. “It has destroyed iniduals and their families with its far-reaching implications – not just the financial impact but the toll this addiction has on people’s mental health, wellbeing and the hold it can take over lives. “While I welcome steps taken to address gambling related harm within the gambling legislation, it’s clear that it falls short of what is needed and does little to protect vulnerable people here. “The North has the highest rates of problem gamblers across the islands – it is critical that gambling laws now are as robust as they need to be.” Mr Durkan also hit out at Sinn Feacutein for not pushing the same line in the North as they have done in the Republic. He added: “This issue is not isolated to the North but rather is a problem for the whole of this island. “I note with interest that Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeys own party has contributed to a similar debate in the Daacuteil calling for all the bells and whistles we would like to have seen within this legislation in a  counties ‘Gambling Strategy’: a gambling regulator, online regulation and self-exclusion regulation.     “My question is, why has Minister Hargey opted to deviate from Sinn Feacutein policy here in the North  Surely, we should be pushing for an all-island strategy. We desperately need regulation both North and South. “The Minister and by extension the Executive cannot run the risk of missing the opportunity now to implement a fit for purpose gambling strategy when given the chance.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Mid Ulster District Council have called on Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon to withdraw a Planning Advice Noticeissued last month. Chair and Deputy Chair of the Councils Planning Committee, Cllrs Kyle Black and Sean McPeake, have written to DfI after aspecial meeting of the Planning Committee agreed that the new ‘Planning Advice Note for Development in the Countryside’ would have serious ramications for rural communities and the Council’s ability to make planning decisions which accommodate rural dwellings. googletag.cmd.push The issue centres on a new definition of buildings which can be taken into consideration when assessing a planning application for development on a farm and proposes that a group of buildings which include a house and domestic garage should not be included. The new policy advice would, according to the Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Kyle Black, be so restrictive as to prevent many people from getting a perfectly sustainable rural dwelling: “In Mid Ulster, the proportion of new dwellings allowed in the countryside is lower than the proportion of people living in the countryside, he said. “There is no need, therefore, to place any additional limitations on development in rural areas. “In fact, I would argue that there is a need to explore policy to provide additional sustainable opportunities for Mid Ulster’s existing rural dwellers. “This policy would effectively tie our hands when it comes to making decisions tailored to, and based on, the needs of local people, which is what the transfer of planning powers to local council was all about”.     Deputy Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Sean McPeake, said the area had the space required. “While other councils may face pressures in terms of accommodating rural development, we in Mid Ulster have the capacity to absorb new dwellings, he said. “To address the issue with a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate, reasonable or fair. “We are also concerned that the guidance could prejudice our ability to progress our Draft Local Development Plan which has been, rightly, developed to ensure that we take account of the very specic planning needs of our rural communities”. A letter has been issued to the Minister detailing the Committee’s objections and asking her to withdraw the planning advice guidance.

The representative for the Sperrin ward was commenting ahead of Thursdays meeting of Derry  Strabane Council where Sinn Feacutein intend to table a motion calling for social care reform. googletag.cmd.push Ms Boyle said that staff shortages and the need for fairer wages that cover travel costs and a lack of pathways for career progression were putting additional pressure on staff and patients. Cllr. Boyle said: “No one doubts there are massive pressures and challenges facing our social care system which is impacting on the ability to deliver high quality domiciliary care within the community. “That was true before the pandemic but has been greatly exacerbated over the past  months. “There are major problems over a lack of workforce planning, leading to staff shortages and high vacancy rates which in turn puts additional pressure on staff, service users and their families. “There is a clear need to improve the terms and conditions of domiciliary care staff, including rates of pay, covering travel costs, and providing career progression pathways. “All that is vitalwe are to ensure that the social care system is fit for purpose now and into the future so that those who need care are properly looked after and staff are properly valued. “To that end, I hope that all parties can support my motion at the full council meeting as it will call on the Western Health and Social Care Trust to provide us with a detailed briefing on the current position regarding social care.     “We are also calling on the Minister of Health to outline his plans to reform adult social care, including a detailed report into the true cost of delivering all aspects of the necessary changes.” In response, Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed his intention to launch a public consultation on reforming adult social care. The consultation will begin later this year. The Minister stated: “I am on record as describing Northern Ireland’s social care system as not fit for purpose. “This was also a central conclusion of the independent Power to People review commissioned by the Department of Health and published in late . “We need to increase the quantity of social care to meet growing demand, we need to improve the quality of social care so that people can live with dignity and independence and we need a fair and equitable answer to the questions of who pays and what and when they pay. “We also need to do right by those hard working and dedicated people who work in this sector, often for minimum wage and in some cases, in real terms, even less than minimum wage. “These are not new challenges though the need to address them becomes more pressing with every day. Solving them will not be easy or cheap which is why they have unfortunately been kicked down the road time after time. That has to stop. “I will be launching a public consultation on reforming social care in Northern Ireland later this year. Options to be addressed in this consultation will include introducing a cap on care costs incurred by iniduals, but this cannot be looked at in isolation from the need to signicantly increase investment. “Reforming social care is one of the biggest and most important issues facing Government. I am looking forward to a wide ranging and informed public discussion on how best to get it right.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

In his answer to my written question, health minister Swann revealedthat people in Derry are at a signicant disadvantage compared to people in other areas in the North when it comes to accessing this essential healthcare service. “While I am pleased the Western Trust was able to start accepting new clients from July this year, I am very concerned at the impact of waiting for access toa full range of contraceptive options. “These need to be accessible to all who need them, when they need them. “I have also written to Health Minister Swann to ask whether his department has any strategy in place to tackle this issue and whether he will commit to making the necessary funding available to ensure there are enough staff to meet demand and reduce waiting times for an appointment. While I realise the Western Trust is dealing with a range of dficult challenges, including staff shortages, it must recognise that access to contraception can be essential in avoiding unintended pregnancies and the personal crisis this can cause.     “Not only do my constituents deserve improved access to the full range of healthcare services, but increased investment in contraception has been demonstrated to save public money in the long term.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out  About at foam party in Dormans Bar, Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSerious sexual assault on woman in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Of Saturdays parade, the PSNI said that a robust evidence-gathering operation was in place and we will now review the footage gathered.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.

The  Johnnies will explain and demysty each topic and the world it occupies, providing real insights for viewers at home by deconstructing the skills required to make it in this unfamiliar territory themselves. In taking on TikTok, the lads meet with some of the top TikTokkers in Ireland like Lauren Whelan whose TikToks have been viewed over  million times. They also learn some valuable TikTok tips from Dublin comedian Killian Sundermann. Killian’s bizarre interactions with hedges have amassed millions of views. Meanwhile, Matty the Viking from Wicklow has made a living from training and chopping wood in a nearby forest, prompting Johnny B to try his hand at chopping wood with the usual hilarious results. They also meet experts in social media and try to discover the magic formula to ensure your TikTok goes viral. Armed with this knowledge, the lads set out to become TikTok famous, with the aim of getting a million views whilst raising funds for their local GAA club. To do this they need to be able to dance - which they can’t - so who better to call upon than professional dancer Karen Byrne of Dancing With The Stars fame to help them out for their big TikTok takeover...      In another episode, the  Johnnies take on urban art. This episode stems from the  Johnnies meeting with Peter Tunney, who runs the Wynwood Walls project in Miami, who appeared on their showThe  Johnnies Take on America last year. Inspired by his art, the lads wonderthey could help create a special mural in their native Tipperary, and so ensues a whirlwind tour of Ireland where they take inspiration from urban art festival Waterford Walls who specialise in large scale street art, take a lesson from childhood legend Don Conroy, meet some final year art students and put on their very first art exhibition! In another episode, the pair attempt to find a sport to represent Ireland in. And in true  Johnniesstyle, they won’t be taking the most well-trodden route. First up it’s a cricket lesson from Irish International legend Kevin O’Brien. The lads then head off-piste to Kilternan, where they get to grips with the ski slopes. Over the course of this episode, they also try their hand at clay pigeon shooting and find themselves in uncharted waters at the National Aquatic Centre but will they take the plunge off a -metre ing board  Finally, the lads are taken on by a Cork American football team and manage to make the trials for the Irish Wolfhounds. In the final episode in the series, the  Johnnies take on E-Gaming. Gaming and e-sports are growing at a tremendous rate with gaming now an entertainment phenomenon grossing more than the biggest movies and consuming more leisure time from the average household than Netflix. In this episode, the lads want to find out more about this ever-evolving subculture of competitive gaming and e-sports. They meet top gamers, streamers and Twitchers, as well as the Munster Rugby e-sports team, play FIFA with the FAI and compete in an e-sports tournament, rounding up some hurling legends to help them on their way. The lads then try to further assimilate into the gaming world, designing and attempting to sell their own game, “Grand Theft Chicken Roll”.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre has fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, councillors hope the complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.News of the shock decision to abort the Dunleath Park scheme was confirmed at a meeting in the town on Monday night when it was revealed that for legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the Charities Board when the lease was first drawn up.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A popular Ballynahinch newsagent has this week been forced out of business by burglars who ransacked his store.On Monday the shutters were pulled down on Ricersquos newsagents at High Street and are unlikely to be opened again by the current owner, Mr Eamonn Rice, who said the attack, the third in three years, has left him ldquomentally and physically wrecked.Thieves smashed their way into the store some time between Sunday night and the early hours of Monday morning and after stealing a large amount of property they completely destroyed anything in sight with crow bars and sledge hammers.Police believe the attack was carried out by professionals who are more than likely from outside the area, probably Belfast, and would have needed ready transport to escape with the goods.Yesterday Mr Rice as adamant that he did not want to have anything more to do with the shop saying that he could not go on working there after the heartless attack.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh pensioner, who has been stripped of his -minute-a-day home help, has accused health officials of abandoning him.Seventy eight year-old John Heaney, who can only walk with the aid of walking sticks, says he is ldquogutted his home help service has been axed and claims the decision came out of the blue.Mr Heaney, from Grove Park, said the first he knew about the decision to remove his daily home help cam when the woman who has been attending him for the past number of years informed him two weeks ago she would not be back.He said he now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free travel for the elderly scheme during a meeting with Strangford MP Iris Robinson.Down councillor Peter Craig and Strangford MLA Kieran McCarthy have been at the forefront of the free travel for pensioners campaign.Describing the ferry crossing as a ldquovital service, Mr Campbell said he ldquofirmly believed free fares should be offered to senior citizens, in keeping with the Department for Regional Developmentrsquos policy to target concessions at users of public transport.The travel scheme will only be available to passengers over  years-old who are travelling by foot and will not be

determinelegislation exists which prohibits sand and shingle being taken from the beach.NEWCASTLE mdash A telecommunications company which sparked controversy in Newcastle in recent weeks has taken steps towards healing damaged relations with local people.BT Cellnet representatives last week dismantled a mast at the Castlewellan Road in the town in an effort to appease the action group, Residents Against Masts , which was established to fight against the structure.The pressure group was formed last Monday night, just hours before the mast was erected against the wishes of local people who believe that it may put the health of children at risk.Following repeated calls by residents, BT Cellnet officials removed the -metre lamp post just two days later.The removal of the equipment has been hailed as a breakthrough by members of the RAM who have vowed to continue to fight against similar proposals in the town.A BT Cellnet spokesman this week confirmed that the mast had been taken down as a ldquogesture, but added that this was a ldquotemporary move.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Work to provide a new storm drain at a housing estate on the outskirts of Castlewellan is due to to start shortly.South Down MP Eddie McGrady has been lobbying the Housing Executive to ensure the drain is provided at the JFK estate in Burrendbridge as soon as possible.The MP said money for the

week.He said at a time when a number of groups are aiming to raise the profile of Ardglass, along comes a group which targets a toilet block.ldquoThese people have no understanding about the impact

played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Actors.jpg","title":"Local actors Shine in short movie filmed around East Down  ","story":"LOCAL actors have been lighting up the big screen in a short film that has recently scooped a notable cinematic award.lsquoShinersquo wrapped up filming last November after cast and crew spent months shooting in a host of local areas such as Bright and Kilmore, and now it has been crowned the lsquoBest Online Short Filmrsquo at the Dublin Underground Film Cinema Festival.The movie has also been listed as a semi-finalist at this monthrsquos Cannes World Film Festival, whereits success is to continue, will make it through to next yearrsquos final.The dramatic tale tells the story of Nick, a young man who lacks confidence in expressing his dreams to his traditional family, and who is tasked with balancing his work le with helping his father on their family farm.Part-time director, writer and actor Declan Curran from Attical, drafted in favours from family members and friends to help bring his debut production to le.The film was an unfunded, therefore it was created with a very limited number of cast and crew.Declandescribed filming in his unclersquos ldquohundreds of years-old cottage in Bright as an ldquoouter body experience, but it was just one of the many things included in the -minute long flick which was close to his heart.ldquoI couldnrsquot be more grateful to my family and friends for their commitment, time and effort of the course of making this film, he said.ldquoI would never have been able to make this dream of mine a reality without them, therersquos loads of personal touches included in the film.The upcoming talent had the help of Bright natives Jimmy and John McIlmailwho star in roles as lsquoFather Hughesrsquo and lsquoJohnnyrsquo.Speaking about Jimmyrsquos role as the priest, Declan says despite his great uncle being completely new to the acting world, ldquothere was no better man for the job.ldquoI actually had Jimmy in mind when I wrote the character of Father Hughes, so it just made sense to me that he was the one to portray him, he said.ldquoThe priest appears in a bus with myself [Nick] during the film, and I actually was wearing my late granddads cap in that scene while my mother Dolores made the priest collar Jimmy was wearing, so it was very family orientated.ldquoDue to Covid- we faced a dficult year in filming, so we had to try find ways around things for shooting. For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

Please try again later.Submitting...While the proposal was backed by Alliance minister Naomi Long, it was voted down by the other Executive ministers, including Mr Swann.Those ministers instead voted to issue guidance to the venues, which include theatres and indoor concert venues, recommending the use of proof of vaccine as one entry requirement.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the decision as “astounding and reckless”.The health minister said he did not back the proposal to make passports mandatory for indoor seated venues because such a scheme was “neither agreed nor ready”.He said the Executive would have been “ridiculed”it had told businesses fearful about the end of the furlough scheme that ministers had decided to mandate a vaccine passport system that was not ready to use.The issue is set to come to a head again next week when ministers consider whether to remove the one-metre social distancing requirement for hospitality venues.The DUP has consistently voiced concern about any move to introduce vaccine passports, citing potential human rights and equality issues.It has also emerged that Mr Swann wrote to all ministers on Saturday expressing frustration that the Executive Office’s Covid- task force had still not produced a policy paper on the issue, five months after he asked for the work to be done.In the letter, seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann wrote: “I would ask as a matter of urgency that the TEO paper on domestic use certication be brought to the Executive without further delay.”In a statement yesterday, he added: “I want a domestic vaccine certication scheme to be in place, on the books, available for use as soon as necessary.“It is regrettable that the Executive has yet to agree a policy position on this. I wrote to Executive ministers as far back as April  asking for this matter to be taken forward by TEOthrough the creation of a cross-departmental working group.“We have waited for the Covid Task Force to pick up the ball and run with this. It is central to the task force’s entire purpose – charting a pathway out of restrictions.”Mr Swann said a passport system could be voluntary in the first instance with the option to make it mandatorythat was necessary.“If we can get a domestic scheme agreed – with the necessary regulations and technology in place – it gives us both options and opportunities, new tools to userequired,” he said.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularFormer IRA ‘folk hero’ is ‘hardly fitting face for Amnesty International campaign’ say unionistsThe unionist parties come together to reject the Northern Ireland Protocol, and call for its replacement with arrangements that respect NI’s place in UKCovid NI:  NI postcodes with the highest number of positive Covid test results in the last seven daysEx UDR soldier: I would never have missed the fine th anniversary tribute parade in Lisburn to an almost forgotten armyThe DUP support for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea in  was a catastrophic error — one of the worst unionist mis-judgements of recent historyMost PopularDublin UVF bomb victim condemns SDLP and Alliance Party over TUV appointments billBrothers’ ‘emotional’ meeting with RUC man they saw ‘killed’ as children in  by IRA sniperUNCUT: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s full letter about  Agreement to top US Democrat Nancy PelosiOwen Polley: Britain should stand up without fear to President Joe Biden over Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland High Street Voucher Scheme: Almost , apply for £ spending card                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The process is really quick and simple. If you are eligible you could have a new boiler which will reduce your energy bills.\"Am I eligible If you are a homeowner who is receiving benefits, itrsquos likely there will be a grant available for you to receive a new eco-friendly gas boiler. Not only is this completely free, but yoursquoll be saving money off your energy bills.\"At First Choice Energy we are passionate about creating a more sustainable world by improving energy systems for homeowners,\" saidAaron.\"Wersquore extremely proud to be certied ECO installers helping UK residents live in a more energy-efficient home. All whilst making our environment more sustainable and eco-friendly. We ask customers to fill in an eligibility questionnaire, and our team will discuss the best options for you. We install energy-efficient boilers, which will help you save money on your energy bills whilst achieving our goal to reduce carbon emissions in the UK.\"Check your eligibility and start the simple process by clicking hereWho is First Choice Energy Limited First Choice Energy Limited is based in Dafen Industrial Park, Llanelli.It is passionate about creating a more sustainable world by improving energy systems for homeowners in Wales and is extremely proud to be certied ECO installers helping residents live in more energy-efficient homes - while making our environment more sustainable and eco-friendly.Director Aaron Davies took on the business from his father, who has been in the trade for nearly  years and is still very much hands-on with the team.First Choice Energy Limited is a registered on the Gas Safe Registered Engineers list, it is endorsed by Trustmark Government Endorsed Quality and is Blue Flame approved.What benefits are considered Eligibility for a free boiler grant will depend on several factors. Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
