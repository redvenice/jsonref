If this boss is happy then everyone else is allowed to be happy.An emotional bomb, and definitely shouldn’t be managing people.A sexual harassment case waiting to happen.A walking, talking sleaze ball, and has the stupidity to think that no-one else has clocked on to their inappropriate behaviour.Always overheard commenting on the physical appearance of colleagues.AKA the scary boss.The type of boss that enjoys embarrassing a member of their team in front of everyone else, and hurls personal insults.Basically, the type of boss that will be pulled up for a tribunal hearing at some point soon.Extremely proud of the team, always shouting about what the team have accomplished, and always signs off expenses without a second glance.This one has no boundaries at all whatsoever.Most likely to be spotted calling colleagues on weekends and during their periods of annual leave, because apparently no-one is allowed any time off.This is the rarest boss of them all. A boss who is genuinely dedicated to their team, and is concerned about your personal development and happiness at work.Finding this sort of boss is like snagging a free Nando’s.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2. The photographer scans the computer booths for the best viewpoint as Mr Markle heads to the front counter to pay to get online  3. Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4. In this grainy image, the figure of Mr Markle sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen can just about be made out, while behind him Rayner uses his long lens to capture pictures he later sells for sizeable fees          5. Rayner trains his lens on Mr Markle, who is in the corner of the cafe, reading stories about Harry and Meghan but looking at the screen at an odd angle          ... to produce this lucrative shot which was flogged to the world\u0027s unsuspecting mediaKensington Palace officials did the same a few weeks before. An official letter, written by Prince Harry’s communications secretary Jason Knauf, described how Mr Markle had been ‘followed and harassed’ by photographers and journalists. The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

The 50,000-tonne aircraft carrier is the first to be built and designed entirely in China and is set to become the Navy\u0027s seccond carrier by 2020          The runway on the new vessel models the skip slope design of its predecessor. Though China still lags behind the United States in terms of military might, the Communist government is increasing the country\u0027s dominance in Asia, where only Japan seriously rivals it          The vessel - temporarily named Type 001A - was sent out for sea trials at 7am today as President Xi Jinping pushes ahead with modernisation in the country\u0027s Navy. Experts say that it still won\u0027t be enough to seriously challenge the dominance of the USA within the next 12 yearsCurrently the country only has a retrofitted Soviet-era aircraft carrier called the Liaoning, which was launched in 2012. But CNN reports the new vessel still won\u0027t be enough to rival the United States, but will boost the navy\u0027s standing in Asia.  Sam Roggeveen, senior fellow at Sydney\u0027s Lowy Institute, said: \u0027This is, in and of itself, not designed to be some frontal challenge to US power in the Asia Pacific, because it simply isn\u0027t in the class of America\u0027s aircraft carriers.\u0027          China only has one aircraft carrier (pictured, the ship at its 2007 launch), which is called the Liaoning. It is a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel, showing the marked difference between the communist country\u0027s capabilities as compared with that of the US           The new aircraft carrier weighs 50,000 tonnes and analysis of recent satellite images suggest that modifications have been made for the ship to transport an additional eight aircraft. Unlike the nuclear-powered carriers the United States fields, the Chinese rely on less innovative means of propulsion More than 1,000 feet in length and 246 feet wide, the new ship uses conventional propulsion as opposed to nuclear and recent analysis of satellite images suggests modifications have been made to hold up to eight additional aircraft.Its predecessor was intended more as a training base, but the new ship is likely to be deployed for combat, putting China alongside the US, the UK, Russia and France in its global capability.  Trump\u0027s armada: Huge task force of 12 warships sets sail for...Red alert in the English Channel: Royal Navy\u0027s HMS St Albans...Having a BLAST! Booms ring out across London as HMS Belfast...Share this articleBut it is still the US that fields more aircraft carriers than any other country. As of this year it fields 11 nuclear-powered carriers with \u0027catapult\u0027 technology, in which pistons or electromagnetic rails speed aircraft up as they leave the runway. This gives them an advantage over the Chinese planes, which rely on their own power and the ski-jump designs on both carriers.          China has sent its first home-built aircraft carrier for sea trials as the Communist government attempts to assert its military might on the world stage. Unable to use electromagnetic rails to speed aircraft up as they leave the runway, the ship instead relies on a ski-jump design          The ship is China\u0027s latest attempt to assert its military might and follows a surge of investment from 2010 to 2017, when the Navy\u0027s ship complement increased from 210 to 320. The country is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters  Once this latest addition passes sea trials, it will need to be further vetted before it is deemed combat-ready. And plenty can still go wrong during the current trial, as the UK\u0027s HMS Queen Elizabeth proved last year when a leak left it in need of repair.And the US Navy\u0027s newest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - has been blighted by glitches despite it being the world\u0027s most expensive at $13 billion. The 100,000-tonne vessel\u0027s catapult launcher, the equipment for catching planes upon landing and its radar were all found to be faulty.  Although China is far from catching up with the US, its military budget this year rose by eight per cent as the military pushes for modernisation. The Navy\u0027s ship complement increased from 210 to 320 between 2010 and 2017, with 2016 alone seeing an increase of 18.  American sea power is expected to continue dominating over the next 10 years, but China is fast developing capabilities to maintain presence in distant waters.  Last week US intelligence suggested there is a high probability that the Chinese fired missiles to three artificial islands in military drills.    China\u0027s first homegrown aircraft carrier heads out for sea trial - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/01/4C28951B00000578-0-image-a-9_1526171811008.jpg","title":"For Futures Sake FFS university group writes MPs stop Brexit","story":"    For Our Future\u0027s Sake is a new collective that represents 60 student unions from different universities across the country.

Pompeo said that Trump and Kim Jong-un would meet in Singapore on June 12 to \u0027see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people\u0027 of denuclearization of the Korean PeninsulaThe nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month, first as CIA director and more recently in his capacity as secretary of state, providing him with greater insight into the 33-year-old head of the hermit nation than any other American, aside from basketball player Dennis Rodman.Pompeo says it is his belief that Kim, who took over from his father in 2011, \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before.\u0027If we are going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take a truly measures to achieve it,\u0027 he said.As the secretary of state, Pompeo said it\u0027s his job to lay the groundwork for a thawing of tensions.\u0027I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives,\u0027 he said.As for his own talks with Kim, Pompeo said, \u0027The conversations are professional...He knows his brief, he knows what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it. \u0027He does follow the Western press. He will probably watch the show at some point,\u0027 Pompeo told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. \u0027He\u0027s paying attention to things the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team, we’ll be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u0027s just possible we might pull off an historic undertaking.\u0027          The nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month. He said Kim \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before\u0027Any deal with North Korea will only be possible if the foreign government that has an economy crashing under the weight of international sanctions feels its financially worth it.Pompeo on Friday said Pyongyang could look forward to a \u0027future brimming with peace and prosperity\u0027 if it gives up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.The lifting of sanctions would allow American companies to enter into contracts with North Korea to rebuild the county\u0027s national infrastructure. Once it\u0027s off the blacklist, Pyongyang could also be eligible for international aid.Sen. Lindsey Graham on CBS on Sunday said, \u0027If you could really get North Korea to give up their nuclear program than I think there\u0027d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. \u0027Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way. When it comes to North Korea, I think there’d be a lot of congressional support,\u0027 he said.Bolton on CNN\u0027s \u0027State of the Union\u0027 slapped down the idea of aid to North Korea, however. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t look for economic aid from us,\u0027 he asserted. \u0027I think what the prospect for North Korea is to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does.\u0027Pompeo told Fox that he was talking about private-sector investments when he made the remark. \u0027Not the U.S. taxpayer, private-sector Americans helping build the energy grid,\u0027 he said. \u0027They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea, to work with them to develop infrastructure. All the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027Even if Trump and Kim agree on the contours of a deal during their Singapore summit, it would most likely need the support of Congress. Former President Barack Obama bypassed lawmakers in 2015 when his administration entered into a nuclear agreement with Tehran to the fury of Republicans who said that only Congress has the authority to approve treaty documents.Bolton on Sunday indicated that the Republican administration was considering proceeding the same way now that Trump is the one in office. \u0027Well it’s entirely possible we’d proceed that way, we’re still thinking about the different alternatives, I wouldn’t want to foreclose the president’s options,\u0027 he said of congressional approval. He admitted in the next breath though that \u0027it’s been one of the criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal to be sure...that a deal of that level of consequence was not given to the Senate as many people think the Constitution provided.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/17/4C2E79F100000578-0-image-a-41_1526230355849.jpg","title":"Mushroom hunters two headed fawn Minnesota forest","story":"    Wild Images In Motion Taxidermy positioned the conjoined fawns on a bed of greenery \u0027There are a few reported cases of two-headed ungulate fetuses, but nothing delivered to term.

Conservation charity Plantlife says ‘nitrogen-guzzling’ plants are crowding out species depended upon by wildlife. These include red clover and white campion, which are important to Britain’s threatened population of beesThere are also concerns that over-zealous council workers are cutting flowers down before they can seed and leaving behind grass from mowing which makes the soil more nitrogen-rich.The ‘dirty dozen’ nitrogen-guzzling plants named by Plantlife are the stinging nettle, bramble, rough meadow-grass, ash, ivy, hawthorn, cow parsley, Yorkshire fog, hazel, blackthorn, sycamore and creeping buttercup.The most rapid decline is being seen in red clover and lady’s bedstraw and the charity says better management of road verges could have spectacular results for wild flowers and wildlife, delivering an estimated 400 billion more blooms.Victims of the changing road verge also include bugle, tormentil and greater knapweed.Dr Dines said: ‘The destructive impact of air pollution on human health is well documented but how pollution affects plant life remains under-appreciated.’ ‘Vehicle exhausts can result in up to 2.5 kg of nitrogen per mile per year being dumped on our road verges - a rate that only a fraction of our wild flowers can cope with.’ More than 24,600 people have signed the charity’s petition calling for council management to better benefit flowers and wildlife."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/23/4C259C1200000578-0-1_Photographer_Jeff_Rayner_camera_slung_over_his_shoulder_arrive-a-6_1526250102531.jpg","title":"Meghans father deeply embarrassed apologise paparazzi photo storm","story":"Thomas Markle\u0027s son (left), Thomas Jr (right), has said his father plans to apologise to Meghan Markle for the stunt that has left him and his family \u0027deeply embarrassed\u0027          Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          ... to produce this lucrative shot which was flogged to the world\u0027s unsuspecting mediaYet Thomas Jr said his father will apologise to both Miss Markle and Prince Harry privately for the pictures - but jumped to his father\u0027s defence saying that the family have been under intense pressure since the royal couple\u0027s engagement. The palace refused to comment on the allegations, but it is understood there is no change to plans for Mr Markle to walk the bride down the aisle of St George’s Chapel on Saturday.All rise for Lord Sugar: Tower Bridge opens to let...Lords in ‘cynical and sad’ new attack on press freedom:...Stocking up for the trip?

The U.S. says sanctions will remain in place until the North compliesJohn Bolton, the president\u0027s national security adviser, described the types of steps that North Korea would need to take as part of a denuclearization process, including the potential involvement of a processing center in Tennessee.\u0027The implementation of the decision means getting rid of all the nuclear weapons, dismantling them, taking them to Oak Ridge, Tennessee,\u0027 Bolton said in an interview with ABC\u0027s This Week. \u0027It means getting rid of the uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities,\u0027 adding the process would also need to address North Korea\u0027s ballistic missiles. \u0027I don\u0027t think anybody believes you\u0027re going to sign the complete ending of the nuclear program in one day.

He described the possibility of American agriculture being used to \u0027support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, pictured, said North Korea could reap financial rewards if Kim Jong-un was willing to fully dismantle his nuclear weapons programmeSouth Korea has said Kim has shown an interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons in return for economic benefits.

In return, the U.S. is willing to help the impoverished nation strengthen its economy.Pompeo was asked on Fox News Sunday whether the U.S. was in effect telling Kim he could stay in power if he met the U.S. demands. Pompeo said: \u0027We will have to provide security assurances, to be sure.\u0027          Failing to destroy the accumulated knowledge would permit the North to carry out further research in secret and resume a nuclear weapons programme at short noticeThe top U.S. diplomat did not elaborate, but his comment could refer to the type of assurances North Korea has sought in the past.A statement issued during international negotiations with North Korea in 2005 over its nuclear weapons development said the \u0027United States affirmed that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and has no intention to attack or invade (North Korea) with nuclear or conventional weapons.\u0027The North has said it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.\u0027Make no mistake about it, America\u0027s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into L.A. or Denver or to the very place we\u0027re sitting here this morning,\u0027 Pompeo said from Washington. \u0027That\u0027s our objective, that\u0027s the end state the president has laid out and that\u0027s the mission that he sent me on this past week, to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.\u0027Pressed in a separate interview on whether the U.S. would seek regime change, Pompeo said \u0027only time will tell how these negotiations will proceed.\u0027US pressures North Korea to ship nuclear weapons overseas before sanctions lifted, according to reports"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/07/4C17204A00000578-5725545-image-a-5_1526277656899.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle spend unmarried weekend Cotswolds","story":"Embrace embellishment like Meghan in Ralph \u0026amp RussoThe royal engagement photographs released late in 2017 caused quite the stir with Meghan Markle in a show-stopping dress by Ralph \u0026amp Russo.From the autumn\u0026#x2Fwinter \u0026#3916 couture collection, this gorgeous gown features a tulle skirt complete with a sheer bodice decorated with intricate leaf embellishment.

Jamie Oliver has not appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time since he debuted on it in 2010BY SEBASTIAN MURPHY-BATES FOR MAILONLINE Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has dropped off the wealth list as his restaurant chain continues to struggle.It is the first time the chef from Essex has been missing from the list since he debuted on it in 2010.His Italian restaurant empire has racked up debts of £71.5million and its staff are owed £2.2million. In January Oliver announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Italian eateries after his food magazine, Jamie, went under last year. The restaurant closures put more than 200 jobs at risk, after creditors pushed through a restructuring plan devised by the chef. A Company Voluntary Arrangement will allow the Italian chain to secure rent reductions on the remaining estate and exit unprofitable stores.  When he closed six restaurants last year, Oliver blamed a combination of rising Brexit cost pressures and tough trading.           The celebrity chef\u0027s restaurant chain has been blighted by problems, which Oliver blamed on BrexitHis chain was stung by the collapse of the pound - which ramped up the cost of buying ingredients from Italy - as well as staff costs and lower footfall. Last month the chef said he could \u0027happily f****** retire\u0027 within the next 12 years as he bemoaned the fact that people blame him for taking away their turkey twizzlers.He told Balance magazine: \u0027I still get “Where’s my Turkey Twizzlers?”.

Pompeo said that Trump and Kim Jong-un would meet in Singapore on June 12 to \u0027see if there is sufficient overlap so that we can achieve the ultimate objective for the American people\u0027 of denuclearization of the Korean PeninsulaThe nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month, first as CIA director and more recently in his capacity as secretary of state, providing him with greater insight into the 33-year-old head of the hermit nation than any other American, aside from basketball player Dennis Rodman.Pompeo says it is his belief that Kim, who took over from his father in 2011, \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before.\u0027If we are going to get to this historic outcome, both sides have to be prepared to take a truly measures to achieve it,\u0027 he said.As the secretary of state, Pompeo said it\u0027s his job to lay the groundwork for a thawing of tensions.\u0027I think we now understand that there is the potential that there are shared objectives,\u0027 he said.As for his own talks with Kim, Pompeo said, \u0027The conversations are professional...He knows his brief, he knows what he is trying to achieve for the North Korean people. He is able to deal with complexity when the conversation requires it. \u0027He does follow the Western press. He will probably watch the show at some point,\u0027 Pompeo told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. \u0027He\u0027s paying attention to things the world is saying. He too is preparing for June 12th. He and his team, we’ll be working with them to put our two leaders in a position where it\u0027s just possible we might pull off an historic undertaking.\u0027          The nation\u0027s top diplomat met with Kim on two occasions over the course of the month. He said Kim \u0027understands\u0027 that in order to strike a deal with the U.S. \u0027this is going to have to be different and big and special, and something that has never been undertaken before\u0027Any deal with North Korea will only be possible if the foreign government that has an economy crashing under the weight of international sanctions feels its financially worth it.Pompeo on Friday said Pyongyang could look forward to a \u0027future brimming with peace and prosperity\u0027 if it gives up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.The lifting of sanctions would allow American companies to enter into contracts with North Korea to rebuild the county\u0027s national infrastructure. Once it\u0027s off the blacklist, Pyongyang could also be eligible for international aid.Sen. Lindsey Graham on CBS on Sunday said, \u0027If you could really get North Korea to give up their nuclear program than I think there\u0027d be a lot of support in Congress to give North Korea a better life. \u0027Provide aid, relieve sanctions with one condition: that you give up your nuclear weapons program in a verifiable way. When it comes to North Korea, I think there’d be a lot of congressional support,\u0027 he said.Bolton on CNN\u0027s \u0027State of the Union\u0027 slapped down the idea of aid to North Korea, however. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t look for economic aid from us,\u0027 he asserted. \u0027I think what the prospect for North Korea is to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does.\u0027Pompeo told Fox that he was talking about private-sector investments when he made the remark. \u0027Not the U.S. taxpayer, private-sector Americans helping build the energy grid,\u0027 he said. \u0027They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea, to work with them to develop infrastructure. All the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027Even if Trump and Kim agree on the contours of a deal during their Singapore summit, it would most likely need the support of Congress. Former President Barack Obama bypassed lawmakers in 2015 when his administration entered into a nuclear agreement with Tehran to the fury of Republicans who said that only Congress has the authority to approve treaty documents.Bolton on Sunday indicated that the Republican administration was considering proceeding the same way now that Trump is the one in office. \u0027Well it’s entirely possible we’d proceed that way, we’re still thinking about the different alternatives, I wouldn’t want to foreclose the president’s options,\u0027 he said of congressional approval. He admitted in the next breath though that \u0027it’s been one of the criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal to be sure...that a deal of that level of consequence was not given to the Senate as many people think the Constitution provided.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/08/4C2B36EF00000578-5724007-Then_Poppy_with_her_puppies_in_2017_The_Irish_Setter_shocked_her-a-5_1526281734979.jpg","title":"Adorable puppies litter 15 reunite mother Poppy birthday party","story":"    Poppy\u0027s puppies play together in Galashiels, ScotlandAdorable puppies have been reunited with their mum one year after fifteen of them were born in one litter.Irish Setter Poppy was surrounded by her puppies this weekend after her owner Lisa Wardle managed to set up a reunion with 11 of them.The tiny dogs spent their first birthday with their mother when Lisa, 40, planned a party.The record for the most puppies for a Setter to give birth to is 16.Mother-of-three Lisa, from Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said: \u0027We didn\u0027t intend to keep any but we ended up with two.\u0027We kept Patch, the only one with a white flash on his head, and another boy called Negan - who is named after the Walking Dead character.\u0027Our daughter Abi took a girl pup called Letty.\u0027It didn\u0027t work out quite how we planned but I wouldn\u0027t be without them - I would have kept all 15 if I had been allowed.\u0027The owners of Patch, Negan, Letty, Forest, Bracken, Cesar, Cooper, Kerry, Poppy Jn, Effie, Cody, Rosa, Rogan, Mia and Rusy have kept in touch via social media.Lisa set up Poppy\u0027s famous 15 Redheads - a group on Facebook - so the owners of the tiny dogs can stay in touch as they grow.

I think what the prospect for North Korea is to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does.\u0027\u0027The prospect for North Korea is unbelievably strong if they\u0027ll commit to denuclearization. That\u0027s what the president is going to say,\u0027 he said. Washington\u0027s demand for the removal of North Korea\u0027s nuclear weapons was set as part of preparatory talks before the Singapore summit. The has US stated that sanctions will remain in place until the North complies.   It\u0027s not know what Pyongyang\u0027s reaction has been althoug there have been reports that the regime is resisting requests that it destroy all its nuclear weapons data and send an estimated 10,000 nuclear scientists abroad according to the Daily Telegraph.One particular worry is that if North Korea does not destroy its knowledge on nuclear weaponry, it could carry out research in secret and resume a nuclear weapons programme at short notice enabling the country to sell the data to other nations or terrorist groups.Pompeo said private-sector Americans could help rebuild North Korea\u0027s energy grid and develop the country\u0027s infrastructure. He described the possibility of American agriculture being used to \u0027support North Korea so they can eat meat and have healthy lives.\u0027  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, pictured, said North Korea could reap financial rewards if Kim Jong-un was willing to fully dismantle his nuclear weapons programmeSouth Korea has said Kim has shown an interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons in return for economic benefits. But it remains unclear if Kim would ever fully relinquish the weapons he probably views as his only guarantee of survival.  The United States is also offering \u0027security assurances\u0027 to North Korea if they\u0027re able to forge an agreement. Pompeo met with Kim last week in North Korea, helping set the stage for Trump\u0027s historic meeting with Kim in Singapore on June 12.Trump has set an ambitious goal for North Korea to get rid of its nuclear weapons in a permanent and verifiable way. In return, the U.S. is willing to help the impoverished nation strengthen its economy.Pompeo was asked on Fox News Sunday whether the U.S. was in effect telling Kim he could stay in power if he met the U.S. demands. Pompeo said: \u0027We will have to provide security assurances, to be sure.\u0027          Failing to destroy the accumulated knowledge would permit the North to carry out further research in secret and resume a nuclear weapons programme at short noticeThe top U.S. diplomat did not elaborate, but his comment could refer to the type of assurances North Korea has sought in the past.A statement issued during international negotiations with North Korea in 2005 over its nuclear weapons development said the \u0027United States affirmed that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and has no intention to attack or invade (North Korea) with nuclear or conventional weapons.\u0027The North has said it needs nuclear weapons to counter what it believes is a U.S. effort to strangle its economy and overthrow the Kim government.\u0027Make no mistake about it, America\u0027s interest here is preventing the risk that North Korea will launch a nuclear weapon into L.A. or Denver or to the very place we\u0027re sitting here this morning,\u0027 Pompeo said from Washington. \u0027That\u0027s our objective, that\u0027s the end state the president has laid out and that\u0027s the mission that he sent me on this past week, to put us on the trajectory to go achieve that.\u0027Pressed in a separate interview on whether the U.S. would seek regime change, Pompeo said \u0027only time will tell how these negotiations will proceed.\u0027US pressures North Korea to ship nuclear weapons overseas before sanctions lifted, according to reports"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/01/4C32F18900000578-0-image-m-77_1526256856376.jpg","title":"Is Britains politest cat Pet feline uses door knocker ask let in","story":"    Footage has captured a very polite cat in Bootle, Merseyside, using the door knocker in order to ask to be let in The incredible clip was captured by motorist Dan Richardson, who had pulled over on the side of the road.He admitted that he had to do a second take after seeing the cat using the door knocker, just like a human.Twiglet the Cambridge Jack Russell who helps students...You must be clucking joking!

Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle, it emerged on Sunday  Thomas Markle\u0027s son (left), Thomas Jr (right), has said his father plans to apologise to Meghan Markle for the stunt that has left him and his family \u0027deeply embarrassed\u0027Privately there was some concern last night over Mr Markle’s ability to cope with the pressure of this week’s royal wedding.It is understood that he has long ‘struggled’ to handle the immense global interest in his daughter’s romance. And he is said to be feeling ‘significant stress’ about this week’s events, which will see him travel to the UK, take tea with the Queen and meet up with Meghan’s mother, his ex-wife Doria Ragland.Samantha Markle, who is estranged from her Suits star sibling, has previously called for Prince Harry to ‘man up’.There has been a bitter row because Meghan and Harry haven\u0027t invited her and her brother.  She accused the Queen’s grandson of rank hypocrisy in offering ‘shout outs about humanitarianism’ while allowing ‘Meg to ignore the Markles’.‘Someone must point out that the ‘Emperor is not wearing any clothes’,’ the 53-year-old raged.The royal bride to be has suffered a number of embarrassments at the hands of her dysfunctional family yesterday.Her estranged half-brother branded her a ‘phoney Diana’ and wrote an open letter to Harry saying it\u0027s not \u0027too late\u0027 for him to call off the wedding.             Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead            The Royal Kitchen at Windsor Castle has begun preparations for the wedding banquet    Pictured the Royal Palaces Head chef Mark Flanagan (right) and the Royal Palaces Pastry chef Selwyn Stoby (left)Still, Harry and Meghan hope that it will make the occasion less fussy and allow them to move around the room greeting as many guests as possible.Guests will also feast on canapes during the lunchtime reception, which will last around two and a half hours and includes speeches and cutting of the cake. Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/11/4C36198C00000578-5726213-image-a-13_1526292465220.jpg","title":"Heroic pilot lands plane passengers cockpit window suddenly SHATTERS 32 000ft","story":"The plane is seen missing a cockpit windshield after it landed in Chengdu, China, this morning (left).

But the figures do not reflect the impact of the company’s recent above-inflation price hike, which takes effect at the end of this month.Nevertheless, Centrica said it was on track to hit its targets for 2018, including holding idends at 12p per share.The company said it was making “good progress” on its £1.25bn-a-year cost-cutting programme. About 1,000 of 4,000 planned job cuts will have taken effect by the year’s end.The number of connected home customers – those using its Hive smart home devices – is set to reach 1 million this week. Its decentralised energy business has also seen growth.Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said the impact of the government’s price cap on standard variable tariffs (SVTs) remains uncertain, but the company expects the measure to be in place by the end of the year.The company now has 3.7 million customers on SVTs, down from 4.3 million at the end of 2017. It expects to cut that further, to about 3 million by the time such tariffs are capped.Analysts said there had been good progress on shifting people off the tariffs and on to better-value fixed deals.

The idea was that the state, massive and overblown as it apparently was after years of Labour profligacy, was taking up too much space in people’s lives. Move the government out of the way and communities would step in to fill the gaps, giving it some of that old British blitz spirit, reinvigorating civil society along the way.As with many Tory policies, this was based on the fantasies of people whose only interaction with the realities of the private rental market was checking the yields on their property portfolios. It’s a philosophy that contains a toxic mix of soft-focus nostalgia for a time that never was, and quasi-religious moralising that sees poverty not as a scourge to be eradicated but a tool for disciplining society’s undeserving into better behaviour.Predictably, this experiment in social engineering did not reveal a hidden population of people with the time and money to spare who had just been held back by the stifling provision of basic public services. The gaps left by the slash-and-burn policies of the Cameron-era coalition were filled not by an army of cheerful local volunteers, but by predators who saw other people’s vulnerability as an opportunity for profit.As Jennifer Williams reported in the Manchester Evening News, the city’s homelessness crisis has provided a rich opportunity for unscrupulous landlords offering “temporary housing” facilities that are often neither temporary nor really housing, except in the broadest possible interpretation, with people living for years in squalid, dangerous buildings. Vulnerable people are given a stark choice – live in a rundown, dirty, unmaintained and insecure environment, or risk life on the streets. The charitable organisation Justlife estimates that there are tens of thousands of households in the UK living in unsupported temporary accommodation, over and above the official homelessness figures.As the big society gave way to the hostile environment, so too did the dangers to which migrants were exposed. In their Women Living in a Hostile Environment report, the End Violence Against Women Coalition says: “The impact of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) conditions on migrant women who have suffered domestic abuse and are financially or otherwise dependent on their spouse or partner has been devastating.” Unable to go to the police or seek public support for fear of falling foul of the Home Office’s opaque rules and obsession with deportation targets, women find themselves dependent on and unable to leave abusive partners.From loan sharks to exploitative employers, rogue landlords to domestic abusers, rolling back basic public services has created opportunities for the unscrupulous to take advantage of those with nowhere else to turn. The big society has become the predatory society.The existence of a forgotten and neglected underclass of people is not something unique to the Conservatives’ time in office. Vulnerable people and those who prey on them are not new. The safety nets in the UK have often been badly maintained and easy to slip through, but the Tory solution has been to blame the safety net itself rather than its design, and then to work to make it even worse.The right wing will argue that this is a negative view of humanity, that they, and they alone, believe that people are noble of spirit and capable of rising above their circumstances. Rather than telling people to rely on “handouts” we should be encouraging them to pull their socks up and get on their bikes. But poverty is a social phenomenon, and public services were the tools that we built to enable people to rise above it. Being poor is exhausting and stressful, and running the gauntlet of a predatory society is a full-time job in itself.At the sharp end of a brutal and precarious society, people do not have the time or resources to perform the role of “we were poor but we were happy” peasants for the edification of privately schooled landowners looking to justify their monopolistic hoarding of the nation’s wealth. Those who find themselves in this situation are regarded as unworthy and undeserving and therefore eminently ignorable – and it’s easy to do when the people tearing up the safety nets are also writing the rules about what counts as deserving. As the late Terry Pratchett observed: “While it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be living in a slum, for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got you invited to the very best social occasions.”Tory policy can – and should – be reversed, but to truly make a difference we have to see through the bankrupt ideology that tries to reimagine letting economic predators off the leash as being socially progressive. Rather than sanctions or deportation targets, we should be setting the target that everyone should have access to a life worthy of living. There should always be an alternative to the loan shark and the slumlord, but it won’t just appear because rightwing theorists say it should. The work has to be put in to make sure everyone has somewhere to turn other than the predators in our society. If not, then what is to stop them taking advantage?• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59b064c533c435042099b4304f315e1b472fa87e/0_64_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9daa592ebf5867f68cc1ffe6c1bcef2c","title":"palestinians israel nakba day gazans","story":"We Gazans may be penned in like animals – but on Nakba day we will show the world our humanity is unbrokenOn the first Friday of the Great March of Return I went to the border between Gaza and Israel with my two youngest children, Yasser and Jaffa. Yes, I named my only daughter after the city I was meant to be born in. This is a bit of a tradition among Palestinians, especially if the place name is a particularly graceful-sounding one. The two of them waved Palestinian flags in their little fists as they walked. Looking directly at the perimeter fence, Yasser asked: “Dad, is Jaffa behind that fence?” My daughter was unfazed by this ambiguity. As I gazed at one of the Israeli snipers, crouched by his gun on the man-made dune that acts as a border, I imagined we were both locked in a staring competition. My kids pose no threat to you, I tried to say with my eyes. We’re more than 300 metres away. My kids have no weapons, no stones they’re not here to fight. It’s a fantasy, of course. Later that day, and in the weeks that followed, Israeli soldiers used extreme force to clear the area: teargas dropped by drones, mortars, live ammunition.The Great March of Return, the peaceful show of resistance by Gazans at this border over the last seven weeks, will culminate on Tuesday on the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba and Israelis mark as the birth of the state of Israel. The border protests have attracted a lot of attention. Dozens have been killed – including kids barely into their teens, and journalists – and thousands more injured any international concern presumably is out of fear of military escalation in the wider region. While this fear is legitimate, it also exposes a profound misunderstanding of the protest.The word nakba, meaning “catastrophe”, refers to the moment in 1948 when more than 700,000 Palestinians were driven out of their towns and villages – the majority of which were destroyed – in what became the declaration of the Israeli state. For us, 1948 was year zero in the collective, inescapable nightmare that all Palestinians have lived through ever since. All that followed – the displacement, the poverty, the wars, the curfews, the interrogations, the incarcerations, the intifadas, the hunger, the lack of basic provisions (medicines, electricity, clean water, drainage), the restrictions on travel ... every horror that has befallen Palestinians – began in that moment.I could have been born in one of my grandfathers’ villas on the southern beach of the city of Jaffa. Instead, I was born in a squalid, overcrowded refugee camp to the north of Gaza City. My European friends often say: “So what! Many more people were displaced during the two world wars and went on to build prosperous, new lives for themselves.” This is true, but at least those conflicts were settled, entire economies were rebuilt. What was left of Palestine was never allowed this happy ending. Most European countries, and of course the US, refused to even recognise Palestine as a state. What chance did it have? Even Britain, which devoted its policies in post-1917 Palestine to replacing Palestinians with Jewish emigrants – thus violating their own mandate to prepare the country for independence – recognises Israel and still refuses to recognise Palestine without conditions.My family’s home town wasn’t entirely lost to me, growing up. The camp I lived in – Jabaliya – was (and still is) ided into neighbourhoods named after the towns and villages their occupants hailed from. So I grew up in the Jaffa neighbourhood, listening to tales of fishing adventures and stories set in orange orchards – memories of life in one of Palestine’s most vivid cities during the first half the 20th century. I always had the feeling that the tellers of these stories were in actual, physical pain as they narrated I imagined them with some covered wound, which quietly bled as they spoke. It was not that they were still living in the past, nor that the past haunted them. It was that they had been abandoned by the past, they had lost it somehow, and needed to reassure themselves that it had ever happened at all.My grandmother Eisha was one of these storytellers. When she was forced to swap her spacious house on the beach for a small, white tent on the hot sands of Gaza, she also had to walk over 100 kilometres for the privilege. Whenever I listened to one of her stories, I felt it was my duty to keep retelling her stories, and to tell them the way she did. Thus, at the age of 12 my first attempts at writing began. I jotted down a version of the story she always told about visiting her doctor in Jaffa. Then I realised there were other stories I could also share and elaborate upon. As a result of the Nakba, my own family is scattered across Gaza and Jordan, as well as Jaffa, where a few relatives managed to remain. The reunification of the family became the goal of my writing: in spirit at least. While Eisha healed the family’s wounds through testimony and remembrance, my mission was to irrigate the present with hope. I write to keep the life of this family moving forwards. But that’s a very personal way of surviving. Each Palestinian has their own private strategy to keep themselves and their loved ones going. The Great March of Return has been one of the rare occasions when people have found a collective strategy for this survival.Of course the protesters know that no one will be returning anywhere at the end of this march. Of course they have no plans (or means) to remove the fence. And of course this protest isn’t an attempt to somehow remove or negate the state of Israel. Any suggestion that these are the aims or expectations is ridiculous. The protesters merely want their voices to be heard they merely want the Nakba, and its decades of repercussions, to be included in the rest of the world’s narrative, rather than dismissed. It is only the hope of becoming a fully recognised state one day (with all its accompanying freedoms) that has kept Palestinians alive these last 70 years – alive through wars, blockades, endless indignities and uncertainties. Those 70 years have turned the Gaza Strip into a prison where everyone is serving a life sentence and everyone’s children will serve a life sentence too and their children’s children, and so on.The protest’s message is simple: We cannot live like this for ever even after 100 years Palestinians will still be born with inalienable human rights, however much the Israelis want to stamp them into the dirt. Israel cannot expect to enjoy peace, stability or prosperity while we are still penned in like animals on a factory farm. The fence is not only a physical border between two nations. It is also a conceptual, discriminatory line between two worlds, two realities. The misery of one world is the happiness of the other the dreams of the former are buried beneath seven decades of sand in the latter.On the first day of the great march, I laughed at the sight of teenage boys tearing up photos of Donald Trump. America has supplied Israel with weapons ever since its inception as a state, and Palestinians know all too well the role Washington has played in strengthening and maintaining the occupation. But what’s different about Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is that it is entirely psychological it has no consequences other than as a provocation. It’s unfortunate that in the century since the Balfour declaration the international community has never once been able to acknowledge the needs of the Palestinian people, and merely treated them as enemies of the Jewish faith. Palestinians have always been able to distinguish between people of the Jewish faith, and the state and government of Israel it’s just a shame that, when it comes to criticisms of the latter, the wider international community has never been able to make this distinction – and in doing so, has continued to fail the ethics, norms and laws that it set up.By trampling over any vestige of a Palestinian narrative in how the world views Jerusalem, Trump has just hung a lantern on the international community’s hypocrisy towards Palestine. By hanging a lantern on it, the playbook goes, you can get away with it, you lay the ground for greater crimes to come.So what next? The Great March of Return might end tomorrow, but the questions it raises will not only remain but continue to pile pressure on Palestine’s prison perimeters. If nothing changes, it is hard to imagine what new direction this desperate nation will take, after a century of political abandonment, 70 years of displacement and – for Gazans in particular – 11 long years of blockade.• Atef Abu Saif is a political scientist and the author of The Drone Eats With Me: Diaries from a City Under Fire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad91f7c52cfeb31ac395dabf11307d0afe52c4d/79_119_4491_2695/master/4491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0371fcb3008e28beb399f687d9953c92","title":"stormzy political pop star grime theresa may grenfell","story":"The grime artist, who called out Theresa May over Grenfell, couldn’t be more different to pious celebrities like Bono and GeldofImagine a Venn diagram consisting of three interconnected rings: the musician, the celebrity, and the well-meaning, liberally minded inidual. Right in the middle of the overlap lies your irritation. You know what I mean. The combination of entitlement and earnestness can be wince-inducing, as the rest of us tough it out in the world of non-chauffeur-driven cars and economy air travel.I’m not talking about celebrities in general or doe-eyed pop stars inviting us to pledge cash for worthy causes, but those rare and few super-philanthropists who seem to make charity work more of their business than it should be, evolving into pseudo-politicians in the process. Bono is the most glaring example, the celebrity humanitarian U2 frontman whose undeniably impressive charitable activity somehow tends to generate eyerolls as much as tugged heartstrings. You’ve probably heard the one about him clapping while telling a festival audience that a child in Africa is dying with each clap, and a heckler shouting back: “Stop fucking clapping then!”Then there’s Bob Geldof, the Live Aid frontman, who told the TV audience to “Give us the money now. Give me the money now” – and cemented his position as a punky politician.But is the humanitarian-popstar-political-influencer a dying breed? I don’t think so. And that’s because of Stormzy.At 24, the grime superstar is a bona fide millennial, but has nothing of the snowflake about him. His militancy goes beyond simple posturing. Political ire is part of his persona. In 2016 he fired tweets at the Conservative candidate for mayor, Zac Goldsmith, and he showed vocal support for Jeremy Corbyn in the run-up to 2017’s general election.But it’s his advocacy on behalf of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire that has seen him embody a new paradigm. Friday’s U-turn by Theresa May’s government, and the decision to broaden the panel overseeing the public inquiry into the tragedy, is a huge moment for the survivors and all those bereaved and made homeless in June last year. They have been campaigning for a panel, instead of a judge-led inquiry, for many months.But Stormzy also played a part, attacking May as a “criminal” from the stage in his performance at the Brit awards in February, and helping to generate support for the petition calling for the panel so that it passed the 100,000-signature mark, ensuring a debate in parliament, due to be held on Monday. As Stormzy tweeted when the target was reached: “Job done”.But Stormzy has none of the implicit condescension of those superstar humanitarians of yesteryear. Your Bonos and Geldofs targeted the loftiest charitable goals of global poverty, perhaps reinforcing a somewhat reductive view of “other” places by reinforcing generations-deep perceptions of “third world” nations as broken.Stormzy, though, seems to act out of an impulse to do good in his immediate surroundings. When he took the first lap in 2017’s Grenfell charity single, crafting an opening verse that was both elegiac and poignant, it felt like honest pain from someone far closer to the trauma he sought to salve. The opening line – “Yeah. I don’t know where to begin” – seemed to sum up the nation’s bewilderment, before defiance crept in: “I will start by saying I refuse to forget you.”There’s an earnest quality to this response that creates warmth, just as Ariana Grande did when she pulled together the One Love tribute concert in the wake of the Manchester terror attack. Like Stormzy, Grande belongs to a new generation of pop stars who can offer ballast to young fans in uncertain times. The difference is that Stormzy retains an underdog edge.For black millennials in urban areas, he might be the definitive spokesperson. His success, and the wider success of grime, represents empowerment and equality in a way that established, mainstream – and yes, white – pop never can. Stormzy seems to know this and, like all good politicians, campaigns along these lines. The video to “Blinded by Your Grace” is a celebration of modern multiculturalism. It puts Stormzy at the centre of a united community, drawing together people of different ages, genders and ethnicities and binning the frequent macho posturing of traditional grime for something closer to a Kumbaya.In 2011, Lethal Bizzle stated that up-and-coming grime stars are “the real prime ministers of this country”, with reference to the spirit of protest embedded within the genre. Stormzy is far from an archetypal politician, but his influence is far-reaching. Ultimately, his support is testament to a generation of young people who don’t need to be told how to wring their hands. A generation seeking integrity, authenticity and passion. A generation for whom above-the-line politics is to be held at arm’s length, but political indignation is something to hold on to.• Jeffrey Boakye is author of Hold Tight: Black Masculinity, Millennials, and the Meaning of Grime.

If that film hinted at a timelessness in its careworn, leisurely paced portrayal of a family of beekeepers, Rohrwacher’s fascinating follow-up goes one further and tinkers with the very notion of time itself.With Happy as Lazzaro, Rohrwacher has crafted a magic-realist fable that doubles as an origin myth for a modern Italy subsumed by corruption and decline. As with The Wonders, it is shot on Super 16mm, lending the film a grainy sepia tinge that initially evokes warmth and nostalgia but in time resembles something more like decay.The setting again is rural Italy, this time a crumbling village with the less-than-apt title of Inviolata. Its inhabitants are an extended family of not terribly motivated sharecroppers under the aegis of a local tobacco magnate, the Marchesa ­Alfonsina de Luna. At first sight the villagers seem to hail from the 19th century, given their antiquated habits and outfits, but the odd modern flourish such as a baseball cap or Walkman suggests otherwise. Either way, there’s a sense of this being a community unmoored from present-day concerns, a feeling intensified by the slow, sun-scorched first hour. Sharecropping, it turns out, was outlawed in the 1980s. The Marchesa has neglected to inform her charges of that detail (a plot point inspired by a real-life incident), arguing that exploitation is something that everyone does, and reason that if she is exploiting the peasants then they in turn must be exploiting someone else. That someone, it turns out is Lazzaro, a peasant boy with an otherworldly vacancy reminiscent of Chance, the simple-minded Peter Sellers character in Being There. Lazzaro is mercilessly but affectionately teased by the rest of the peasants, who have him carry out duties no one wants to do, such as picking giant cabbages and guarding the chicken coop from wolves.One day the Marchesa arrives for one of her periodic visits to the village, bringing along her son Tancredi, a callow youth with bleached hair and a miniature dog he carries under one arm. Tancredi takes a liking to Lazzaro, though more in the manner of a pet than a friend, and recruits him to help with a wheeze he is planning to spring on the Marchesa, whom Tancredi intensely dislikes. Tancredi plans to fake his own kidnapping, hiding out in the wilderness around the village listening to his Walkman while he waits for his mother to cough up the million lire his ransom note has demanded.Things don’t go according to plan, and the film undergoes a dizzying temporal and tonal shift, one which – without giving the game away – leaves Lazzaro an even more unmoored figure than he was before. The golden Italian countryside gives way to scuffed urban sprawl, the figures he encounters are more unscrupulous than before, and the inequity seen in miniature in Inviolita is suddenly writ large.Lazzaro reacts to all this with the same blank implacability as he does everything, and remains a mystery to the end. To some, he’s a ghost to others, a saint to Tancredi, a good-luck charm. Often he just seems to be a victim, a placeholder for some pastoral vision of Italy that has been trampled underfoot by modernity. More than anything else, he is a figure as elusive as this beguiling, half-remembered dream of a film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d980902e926aa8fccccb3aea86394ef0db16b25c/0_0_2705_4134/master/2705.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8e9336621dd2cda368c12d10a324a386 960w","title":"gigi buffon david de gea keepers football undervalued","story":"Goalkeepers are transferred for less and paid less. Is it time football finally valued them relative to outfield players?So arrivederci then, Gianluigi Buffon. Assuming there is no careering handbrake turn away from retirement, the match against Verona on Sunday will prove his last. It seems vaguely astonishing that he made his debut in 1995 – a teenage action hero clad in pink and black for Parma, fearlessly facing down George Weah, Roberto Baggio and the rest of Milan’s all-stars. Nearly 900 games later, he will hang up his Puma One Grips having averaged a trophy for each year of his career.And along with a World Cup, Uefa Cup, five Italian Cups, six Italian Super Cups, a European Under-21 title and multiple Scudetti, Buffon holds another honour. For he remains the only keeper in the 50 biggest transfers in history according to Transfermarkt (which tracks deals in Euros) – even though his €52m move to Juventus took place 17 years ago.Back in 2001 that price seemed crazy. Now it looks like one of the bargains of the century. Yet few clubs have dared follow the Old Lady’s lead. Incredibly, Transfermarkt lists only 11 keepers who have cost more than €15m (£13.2m). In a world where Theo Walcott and Guido Carrillo both cost £20m that seems bizarre. But according to Nick Harris’s excellent Sporting Intelligence website it illustrates a wider trend. His numbers show that keepers are also paid less than defenders, midfielders and strikers – and have become less valued relative to outfield players too.It seems obvious that some keepers are massively undervalued. The question is can we prove it?Ted Knutson, who worked on player recruitment at Brentford and the Danish club FC Midtjylland and heads the football consultancy StatsBomb, believes so. As he explained during a presentation at South Bank University last week, keepers are often harder to evaluate than other positions. They need to sweep up, distribute the ball accurately and start attacks as well as keep clean sheets. Yet the data isn’t always there to properly assess their strengths and weaknesses.Save percentage, for instance, matters little if every shot goes down a keeper’s throat. And while looking at how a keeper performs compared with the expected goals (xG) they are predicted to concede is more robust, it doesn’t take into account defensive pressure or the power of a shot.Knutson recalled a chat with Bob Bradley, the former coach of Swansea, while interviewing him for the Midtjylland manager’s job. While amenable to using data, Bradley pointed out an obvious flaw with xG. “You can’t tell me that if I have two men on a guy having a header from six yards out that is a good chance,” he said. “I know for a fact it is a very hard to score.”Knutson conceded he had a point. “But I have to look across 30 leagues across the world to find undervalued players,” he replied. “And I cannot duplicate your eyes across 20,000 players and multiple seasons.”Now, however, Knutson believes he has a more reliable way of assessing chances and keepers. A key breakthrough is that the velocity of every Premier League shot can now be tracked (unsurprisingly Riyad Mahrez and Harry Kane lead the way in attempts from distance) – and his data also shows the exact position of each player when the ball was hit, and whether the keeper was moving, set, or on the ground.This gives the scout or analyst a wealth of information. It means they can assess a keeper’s reaction time how good their positioning is compared with other keepers across multiple leagues and, ultimately, how good their saves are. It could, suggested Knutson, be a game changer.Using this data, his StatsBomb colleague Derrick Yam then ranked keepers in the Premier League in 2017-18. Unsurprisingly David de Gea was right up there, conceding eight goals fewer than an average keeper would based on the shots he has faced. Arsenal’s Petr Cech ranked last, having conceded six goals more than expected (Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet was not far behind).We all know De Gea is far better than Cech. Yet having such numbers gives us a much better idea of their respective worth. As Knutson says: “Conceding eight goals less a year than average is a massive amount. Flip it around and say an average striker scores 10 goals a year and is worth £20m. Depending on age and other factors, an extra eight league goals could make a striker three times as valuable.”And if De Gea’s exceptional performances are repeatable across multiple seasons – and the evidence suggests they are – he and other top young keepers should be worth a minimum of £50m or £60m.Longevity should be another factor in their favour. We know that players decline physically as they wade into their 30s. Yet keepers appear to cast off their powers at a slower rate, and what they lose in reactions they often make up for by reading the game better.Certainly no one at Juventus will be counting the cost of signing Buffon all those years ago. Especially after he paraded a seventh successive Scudetto in front of an adoring Curva Sud Scirea on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c7e69502f0ddb7fdf985a38e08c61cbf954e09/280_271_3015_1809/master/3015.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615f57b24d5309f45da759f8f0abf53b","title":"juventus extend my7h a success to celebrate or a cause for lament","story":"The all-conquering Old Lady has no plans to abdicate her throne even with the inevitable summer changes aheadLast May, the commemorative T-shirts celebrated a “Le6end”. This year, Juventus went with “My7h”. Even as players popped champagne corks for the second time in four days at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, it was tempting to imagine a marketing team somewhere starting to plan out the slogans and hashtags for the next round of celebrations in 12 months’ time.Seven consecutive Scudetti. No club had even won six in a row before the Bianconeri embarked on their present run. Across Europe’s top five leagues, only Lyon, at the start of this century, have enjoyed such an uninterrupted spell of domestic dominance. Even then, they did not pair Ligue 1 success with cup triumphs. Juve’s 0-0 draw with Roma on Sunday sealed an unprecedented fourth straight Serie A and Coppa Italia double.Whether that is an achievement to celebrate, or a cause for lament might depend on your perspective. The front page of La Repubblica’s sport section on Monday reminded us: “Hegemonies do not help a system to grow.”Beneath that headline, Angelo Carotenuto drew links between the advent of pay TV and a diminished competitiveness: accusing clubs of prioritising comfortable economics over competitive championships. Even in Spain, he noted, where a duopoly exists, other clubs have found success on the European stage.There is merit to such arguments, and it is true that too few Italian clubs have shown the ambition Juventus did in building their own ground at the start of this decade, as well as adapting in other ways to the modern commercial environment. Since moving into what is now the Allianz Stadium, Juventus have won the league every year and increased their annual revenues almost three-fold.And yet, in this specific season, is it fair to put the Old Lady’s success down to a lack of competition? Napoli’s title challenge fell apart at the crucial moment, but with a victory over Sampdoria they nevertheless reached 88 points: a club record in Serie A. If they win at home to Crotone on the final weekend, they will become the first team to fail to win the Scudetto with more than 90.Juventus are simply too strong, too unerringly consistent. Finances have skewed the playing field, but we ought not let that obscure the fact that what they have achieved is astonishing. The wealthiest clubs will prevail most of the time in football, but it is simply not true that they always do – see Monaco and Leicester.Perhaps, if Juventus were still performing as poorly in Europe, their achievements might yet be easier to dismiss. But this team has been to two of the past three Champions League finals and was eliminated this year by a last-minute goal away at the Bernabéu.It is the resilience of this team that marks it apart. Juventus had been atrocious in the first leg against Madrid, yet somehow attacked the return game with the conviction of a side that still believed it could find a way through.Domestically, they always do. Juventus were four points behind Napoli when they travelled there in December. The Partenopei were playing the better football. Massimiliano Allegri had his team dig in and grind out an uninspiring but nerveless 1-0 victory.Similarly, when Napoli beat them in Turin and seemed to blow the title race wide open, Juventus refused to yield. From 2-1 down to Inter in the 87th minute at San Siro one week later, they emerged with a win.Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri defined that as the moment when the race ended. His team had been watching at their hotel in Florence. Deflated, they slumped to a 3-0 defeat against Fiorentina. It was an almost identical scenario to the one in March, when Juventus stole an injury-time win out of nowhere at Lazio, before Napoli imploded against Roma.Since 2014, Juventus have bid farewell to Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal, Paul Pogba, Carlos Tevez, Álvaro Morata and Leonardo Bonucci, to name but a few. Allegri has adapted and reinvented each season, never seeming to rush in the new arrivals but typically getting the most out of them by the end.He never even found a settled formation this time around. In 37 league games, Juventus have used 36 different line-ups. Along the way, Allegri found ways to integrate Federico Bernardeschi, Mattia De Sciglio and Wojciech Szczesny. He took a slowly-slowly approach with Douglas Costa, and now has him looking like this team’s brightest star.“I will need to speak to the directors,” said Allegri when asked if he planned to stay, amid reports linking him with Chelsea and Arsenal. “Tomorrow I’m going to the seaside but if they don’t send me away then I will be back next year … Some people will leave, some will arrive. Whatever happens we want more victories.”Among those departing will be Gigi Buffon, barring any late reversal of his decision to retire. This was the goalkeeper’s ninth Serie A title – excluding those revoked as a result of Calciopoli – a record no other player can equal. Yet the fact that he did not play on Sunday, leaving space for Szczesny, was a reminder of how this team has worked to plan ahead throughout this era of dominance.Juventus’s summer transfer campaign is already well under way, with Emre Can expected to arrive from Liverpool, along with Mattia Caldara and Leonardo Spinazzola from Atalanta. More will follow. Nowhere is it written that this run must end at seven. The Old Lady has no plans to abdicate her throne.• Roma will also return to the Champions League, but we don’t know which team will join them. At least Lazio had the twin excuses of playing against a Crotone side fighting for survival, and without Ciro Immobile and Luis Alberto. Inter were beaten 2-1 at home by Sassuolo. Nevertheless, they can take fourth if they win at Lazio.• Milan and Atalanta will take the final Europa League spots, barring a defeat for the latter, and a seven-goal swing to Fiorentina. The Viola lost their cool on what was supposed to be a day to celebrate Davide Astori, losing 1-0 at home to Cagliari (whom the defender also represented) in a game that ended with scuffles on the pitch and both Fiorentina midfielder Jordan Veretout and manager Stefano Pioli sent off.• Cagliari’s win lifted them out of the relegation zone and, combined with victories for Udinese and Chievo, dumped Crotone back into 18th spot.• Sampdoria’s game at home to Napoli was halted for several minutes in response to discriminatory chants from the home support towards people from Naples. Samp’s owner, Massimo Ferrero, even walked out to plead with fans and appeared to be heeded, although only after being abused himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83b31d1790a6da2bfb42286e86e019f28f3c2d67/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8629370d6fd78e17a57701ac722add31","title":"riotous final day captures the paradoxes of bundesliga 2017 18","story":"There has been plenty of entertainment but it has been an unusual and not always satisfying season in GermanyThe clock, since you asked, kept on ticking. As the curtain fell on Hamburger SV’s unbroken presence in top flight since the Bundesliga’s formation in 1963, it was alone in maintaining steady hands (give or take it being digital). With the home side’s winning position futile, as Wolfsburg completed an eventually emphatic victory over Köln 170km to the south, any façade of holding it together began to crack.Pyrotechnics rained down from the ultras in the Nordtribüne and a heavy police presence took over the pitch in lines, with horses and dogs for company. Some of those waiting to see if the famous timepiece – adding every extra second to HSV’s ever-present tenure – would stop must have struggled to see it through thick plumes of black smoke.“It could,” wrote a seething Hamburger Morgenpost, “have been a very dignified descent from the Bundesliga. HSV wanted to leave the main stage of German football with their heads held high, but then the arsonists in Volkspark took over the command and destroyed this beautiful scene.” The newspaper’s ire had been shared by many of the other fans in the Volkspark, who whistled and chanted “Wir sind Hamburger und ihr nicht” at the ultras.On the pitch the players waited 15 minutes for the field to be cleared of objects, stewards, police and animals, desperate to complete the final few seconds of stoppage time. Tatsuya Ito, who had been one of HSV’s beacons of hope in the game, couldn’t hold back the tears any longer. Borussia Mönchengladbach, knowing their chance of snatching a European place had gone, could have done without their quarter-hour of purgatory too.It’s the hope, as they say, that kills you, and by this point all hope had been and gone. They had been ready for relegation for a couple of months, as we said in this column a few weeks back, clearing the decks in getting rid of chairman Heribert Bruchhagen and sporting director Jens Todt, and promoting reserve coach Christian Titz to seemingly do a glorified relegation stocktake. Titz actually inspired a thrilling run that was just too little, too late. The paradox of the club hitting a record low just as they completed a fourth Bundesliga win in six was not lost on people. “Right now,” Titz told Sky after the dust settled, “I feel a lot of disappointment, because I believed until the very end that us winning could be enough.”To channel this sort of response from a limited group of players – quite how limited was underlined by Bobby Wood’s thoroughly avoidable, yet almost laudable second-half red card for a second booking – was really something. With captain Gotoku Sakai emotionally pledging to stay at full-time, both automatically relegated clubs – extraordinarily - have a positive energy to them. The pair are representative of an unusual, and not always satisfying, Bundesliga season. There has been plenty of entertainment,the 36 goals rattled in on the final day showing that. Yet on a Saturday when even champions Bayern Munich, led in their title celebrations by Manuel Neuer (who’s still yet to play since September) and finished 21 points clear , managed to put a dampener on their own party by losing 4-1 at home to Stuttgart, acknowledging that there have been better seasons in the competition’s recent history quality-wise was inescapable.That was equally apparent in one of the day’s most meaningful fixtures, between Hoffenheim and Borussia Dortmund. Julian Nagelsmann and his players deserve enormous credit for surpassing even last season’s excellence, after their 3-1 win assured third place and Champions League qualification. The enormity of their achievements visibly hit the players, with Nadiem Amiri and Kevin Akpoguma among those collapsing in tears at full-time at an emotional Rhein-Neckar Arena. It was plain, however, that they got there at least partly through the shortcomings of others. One only had to look at their opponents. Dortmund squeezed into the top four too, by a whisker, having been left sweating by a defensive horror show. It was, as goalscorer Marco Reus told the cameras after the game, “symbolic of our whole season”.The restructure is already under way, with Matthias Sammer and Sebastian Kehl included and Lucien Favre expected to join from Nice. Departing coach Peter Stöger – unlike goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who made a brief pre-retirement cameo in stoppage time to a big reception – may not be remembered as a Dortmund great, but there appears to be a degree of appreciation for him among supporters, with respect for his working manner, if not always for the quality of football his team produced. The Austrian inherited a team in eighth place and delivered them into the top four. That wasn’t a given. He is set to receive a €2m bonus for reaching the Champions League at the end of his 154 days in charge. So poor Leverkusen, having come so far under Heiko Herrlich and developed into one of the best teams to watch in the league, fell agonisingly short on goal difference after ending up level on points with Hoffenheim and Dortmund.The retiring Stefan Kießling saw a penalty, which he spotted up, rescinded by VAR when they were three up against Hannover, which could have made it even tighter, and Die Werkself subsequently let in a pair of late goals. In reality, losses to Dortmund and Stuttgart then a failure to win in Bremen leading up to this cost them, rather than the final day.With national debate about German clubs’ perceived underachievement in European competitions, many supporters and commentators hope 2018-19 sees an improvement in standards – a banquet of some substance, rather than a fast food fix.• Hats off to Stuttgart, then, who will qualify for the Europa League if Bayern win the DfB Pokal final against future coach Niko Kovac’s Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Coach Tayfun Korkut said he would enjoy the final “with a glass of red wine”, and without tension, as he well deserves. After his appointment in place of the popular Hannes Wolf was widely criticised, Stuttgart took more points in the Rückrunde than any other team apart from Bayern.• The suspicion before the final day that HSV might have a chance was largely informed by the potential for Wolfsburg combusting at the moment of truth. Instead, Bruno Labbadia’s side stepped up from the moment Josuha Guilavogui’s fine strike gave them the lead 40 seconds in. They also recovered well from Jonas Hector’s equaliser to win 4-1, setting them up for Thursday’s play-off first leg against Holstein Kiel, who were in the third tier this time last year.• Leipzig also got off to a flier, with Dayot Upamecano giving them a lead inside 90 seconds at a Hertha Berlin who seemed dazzled by the visit of Ryan Reynolds. The real star of the show as the side qualified for Europe was Ademola Lookman, who scored and set up two more in a 6-2 victory.

The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40.It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0daf9254a0056460ba557b350845ea71a740149e/0_1679_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7f8bcba6ea1690e2edfa05c6555dbc","title":"anna jones recipe cooking lettuce","story":"Give salads a new dimension by charring leaves or simmering them into a spring soupI’m not sure who came up with the idea of cooking lettuce, but they should be applauded because, however ridiculous it may seem, a cooked lettuce will almost always triumph. There is without question a place for a cool, crisp and raw salad leaf, but on these half-summer, half-winter days of spring, I need some persuasion to eat a lettuce: these two recipes have my arm twisted.Caesar salad: the clean crunch of cos lettuce, the serious hit of flavour from the garlic-kissed dressing, the burnished golden-brown of a crouton. This version is a bit different: a quick char brings sweetness to the little lettuces, and tahini and garlic give a little punch to a dressing I make on repeat.6 little gems or 3 cos lettuces2 slices sourdough1 tbsp olive oil Salt and black pepperZest of 1 unwaxed lemon40g parmesan (I use a vegetarian one)For the dressing½ garlic clove4 tbsp light tahini2 tbsp Greek yoghurt1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1½ lemons2 tsp dijon mustard1 dash of soy sauce or tamariHeat a griddle pan over a high heat and heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Cut the lettuces in half lengthways, and then again into quarters.Tear the bread into bite-size pieces, put on to a baking tray, drizzle generously with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper, then put into the oven to toast until lightly golden – about five to 10 minutes.Meanwhile, griddle the little gems for a couple of minutes on each side, until deep char marks form and they collapse a little. Lay the charred lettuces on a platter, season with a little salt and set aside.Next, make the dressing: finely grate the garlic into a food processor, add all the other ingredients with six tablespoons of water, and blitz smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon, salt, pepper and soy to taste.When the croutons are ready, take them out of the oven and sprinkle with the lemon zest and some parmesan, then put them back in the oven for another minute or two.To serve, toss the charred lettuce in a few tablespoons of the dressing, then put it on to a platter, scatter with the croutons and grate over the rest of the parmesan. Serve with some more dressing and a good grind of black pepper.A stellar early summer soup, as good hot as it is cold. You can, of course, use frozen peas, too: just cook them for a few minutes less.1 tbsp olive oil1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 stick celery, finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and finely slicedSalt and black pepper, to taste1 litre vegetable stock500g fresh peas, shelled2 heads of romaine lettuce, washed and roughly sliced1 small bunch parsley1 small bunch tarragonLemon juice, to taste (optional)To serveGreek yoghurt (optional)Olive oilFresh peas2-3 radishes, finely slicedPea shoots, to garnishHeat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion, celery and garlic and a good pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and sweet: this should take about five to seven minutes.Next, add the stock taste and add salt if needed, then bring to a simmer and cook for five minutes.Add the peas and cook until soft and sweet – about five minutes – before adding the lettuce. Push the lettuce under the liquid as much as you can, cover and simmer for another two minutes, giving the lettuce time to wilt, then turn off the heat and add the herbs.Use a hand blender or a jug blender to whizz the soup until it’s as smooth as you like it, thinning with a little more hot stock, if you like. Taste and add more salt and pepper – or even a squeeze of lemon if you think it needs some sharpness.Either return the soup to the pan to keep warm, or let it cool, then chill for a few hours until it’s cold. If serving chilled, check the seasoning again before serving, because it may need more salt.I like to serve mine topped with a swirl of yoghurt, a few drops of olive oil, a few more fresh peas, sliced radishes and a tangle of pea shoots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4688e3f54a96fac4e92b9825170791681e713afd/0_0_6015_3608/master/6015.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d11a35bcb2a82f9d5da09d6cd21ae47c","title":"nigel slater salad recipes for early summer","story":"Zesty noodle salad with sprouted beans, and papaya with passion fruit and ginger – luscious and refreshing dishes best eaten outdoorsAs the days warm up, I find myself in need of recipes that involve slightly less time spent at a hot stove. The sort of unhurried cooking that fits comfortably into summer living, when there seems to be less time to cook and when the great outdoors beckons. There is not one of this month’s collection of recipes we haven’t eaten outdoors, mostly at the table but a couple eaten on our laps sitting on the kitchen steps.Use whatever noodles you have around for this crisp, light salad. I have suggested brown rice noodles but only because that is what I had in the house. The dressing is at its most refreshing when sharp, sweet and hot, but tweak it to your liking, adding more palm sugar or lime juice as you wish.For the dressinglimes juice of 2 light soy sauce 2 tsppalm sugar 2 tspsmall hot red or green chilli 1garlic 2 small young clovesRinse the mung beans under icy-cold running water and drain. Scrub the carrot, slice thinly lengthways, then into matchstick-size strips. Pour boiling water over the noodles and leave to soak for 10 minutes till swollen and tender. (Check the cooking instructions on the packet depending on the noodles you are using.)Lightly peel the cucumber, then slice in half from stalk to tip, scrape out the seeds and core with a teaspoon and discard them. Cut the cucumber into pencil-thick slices. Remove the leaves from the coriander, leave any small ones whole, and roughly chop the larger ones. Do the same with the mint leaves. Shred the pak choi.Toss the mung beans, carrot, cucumber, pak choy and herbs together. Drain the noodles and toss with the vegetables and herbs.Make the dressing: mix together the juice of the limes, the light soy and sugar. Finely chop the red chilli and add to the dressing. Peel, smash, then finely chop the garlic. Toss the dressing, vegetables, herbs and noodles together. Finally, coarsely chop the peanuts and scatter over the salad.Classic flavours here – mushrooms with garlic and tarragon, but served as a salad rather than in the traditional manner. You could happily serve this to start a summer lunch, but I like to put them on the table with cold roast beef.Serves 4 as a side saladwhite chestnut mushrooms 200gtarragon 10ggarlic 3 small clovesolive oil 6 tbsplemon juice of 1 largepea shoots 4 loose handfulsyoung salad leaves a couple of handfulsFinely slice the mushrooms, about the thickness of a pound coin, then put them in a shallow mixing bowl. Pull the leaves from the tarragon stems. Finely slice the garlic.Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a low to medium heat, add the sliced garlic and fry for three or four minutes till pale gold and deeply fragrant. Keep the heat low to moderate, and remove from the heat as soon as the oil is infused with the garlic. While the oil is still warm, pour over the sliced mushrooms, add the tarragon and toss the garlic, tarragon and mushrooms gently together.Squeeze the lemon juice over the mushrooms, cover with cling-film and set aside in a cool place for 30 minutes to an hour, until the mushrooms are soft and almost translucent. Rinse and dry the pea shoots and leaves, then pile them on a serving dish. Spoon the mushrooms on top and serve.This is my go-to salad. A rearrangement of classic ingredients into a great bowl of food I am happy to eat on any occasion. Even for breakfast. The point is that the ingredients are all those I have in the house anyway. And if there is no pancetta, streaky bacon will do.Serves 2-4For the dressingegg yolks 2olive oil 4 tbspdijon mustard 1 tbsp lemon juice of ½For the saladsmall gem lettuces 2pancetta 50g, thinly slicedanchovy fillets 3chopped parsley 2 heaped tbspfresh white bread 50gbutter 40ggrated parmesan 2 tbspPut the egg yolks into a salad bowl then gradually add the olive oil a few drops at a time, beating constantly with a balloon whisk, then stir in the mustard and lemon juice.Trim the lettuce and separate into inidual leaves. Wash in iced water and dry in a salad spinner.Grill the pancetta or fry in a dry, shallow pan until crisp and drain on kitchen paper. Finely chop the anchovy fillets and mix with the parsley.Make crumbs from the bread, either by hand or in a food processor. Melt the butter in a shallow pan, add the crumbs then let them colour lightly over a moderate heat. Keep them moving so they don’t burn. When they are crisp and golden, stir in the chopped anchovy, parsley and grated parmesan.Put the lettuce leaves into the dressing then add the crisp pancetta and the toasted crumbs, toss gently and serve.Asparagus is never better than when glistening in a fine layer of fat – be it melted butter, Hollandaise sauce or dipped into a lightly boiled egg. I suggest wrapping it in lardo, which softens under the heat basting the spears as it melts. If this gently aromatic product evades you, pancetta cut in very fine slices will work too.Bring a pan of water to the boil. Trim the asparagus. Lightly salt the water then gently lower in the asparagus and leave to cook for about 9 minutes, testing regularly for tenderness. The exact time will depend on the thickness of your asparagus.Heat the oven grill. Slice the baguette in half lengthways, then into four pieces, moisten the surface of each with a little olive oil, then toast under the grill till pale gold in colour.Drain the asparagus, then loosely wrap the spears in clusters of three in a couple of slices of the lardo or pancetta. Place the spears on the toasted bread and return to the grill until the lardo is translucent and sizzling.Trickle over a little more of the olive oil and serve immediately.Papaya – fragrant, soothing and luscious when fully ripe – is something I usually keep for breakfast in summer. Its true flavour shines in the company of lime or sharp orange juice or, best of all, passion fruit. Ginger and mint put a spring in its step too.Serves 4passion fruit 4papaya 2 small or ½ a very large one (about 800g)vanilla pod ½ginger a thumb-sized piece small mint leaves a fewSlice each passion fruit in half then scrape their pulp, juice and seeds into a small, fine sieve or tea strainer suspended over a small bowl. Using a teaspoon, push everything through the sieve until only the dry seeds remain. (I like to reserve a few of the juicer seeds to finish the dish with – I find the contrast of soft fruit and crunchy seeds pleasing.)Peel the papaya, slice in half and discard the seeds. Slice the fruit thinly, each piece about the thickness of a pound coin. Lay them in a shallow layer in a large, shallow dish or deep plate.Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways, scrape out the black paste with the point of the knife, then stir it into the passion fruit juice. Peel the ginger and grate it finely to a soft, wet paste, then stir some of it into the passion fruit juice, tasting as you go. It should be sweet-sharp and slightly spicy. Add more ginger as you wish. I find about 2 teaspoons perfect.Spoon the passion fruit and ginger dressing over the slices of papaya, together with any reserved passion-fruit seeds, cover loosely with clingfilm and chill for a good hour before serving. As you bring the dish to the table, refresh the papaya with any juice that may have pooled around the fruit, and scatter over a few young, fresh mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68848834eed98422f2546a6789f8ebd0c2ead6ee/0_154_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d0f8b4e0836428d18bcc2a5abbb115","title":"seven ways to deal with hay fever","story":"Try to stay indoors as much as you can on high-pollen days. In particular, avoid outdoor activity between 10am and 4pm, the peak time for pollen dissemination. The best time to be outside is after rain, which helps to clear pollen from the air. If you are outside on high-pollen days, taking precautions such as putting petroleum jelly around your nostrils to trap pollen and wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop it getting into your eyes can help.Wash your hands often. On high-pollen days, make sure you shower and wash your hair when you get home home, since pollen can collect on your skin, hair and clothes throughout the day. Make sure you wash bed sheets weekly in hot water.Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible to prevent pollen from settling in your home and consider buying a dehumidifier to keep the indoor air as dry as possible. Portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can help keep your bedroom pollen-free, while many experts suggest using a vacuum cleaner with an inbuilt HEPA filter. In the car, try to use air conditioning rather than opening the window on hot days, particularly when the pollen count is high.Avoid hanging laundry outside to dry, since your clothes can trap pollens. Gardening chores such as mowing the lawn and weeding can trigger hay fever attacks, so consider wearing a filter mask while doing such activities.Dairy products and sugary foods can exacerbate common hay fever symptoms such as nasal congestion, because they increase the production of mucus in the respiratory tract. Try alternatives to dairy such as almond milk and rice milk and try to supplement your diet with foods that have natural antihistamine properties such as broccoli, asparagus, onions, garlic, cherries, pineapple and kiwi fruit.Antihistamines are the most common hay fever medications. While they are associated with side-effects such as drowsiness, more modern antihistamines such as cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine are less likely to make you sleepy. You may need to try several types to find which works best for you consult a pharmacist for advice. If you see that high pollen counts are forecast, start taking medication before your symptoms begin.Herbal remedies such as licorice tea, nettle tea and ginger and honey may help relieve symptoms such as congestion and itchiness, since they help to reduce respiratory tract inflammation. The tea should be steeped for at least eight minutes to ensure that the crucial ingredients are present in a higher concentration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a12da554894d91e31d43b1488dd6057ba58dda/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e533ade59ef45e5da66b1ae58d7d3792","title":"tried everything to cure premature ejaculation","story":"I have had this problem for 12 years and nothing I have tried – from medication to yoga and therapy – has helped. It is ruining my relationships with womenI am 27 years old and have been battling premature ejaculation since I first had sex at 15. It was one of the main causes of my seven-year relationship breaking up, and has left me feeling insecure about my relationships with women. I have tried everything from medication (paroxetine) to yoga (vinyasa yoga to control breathing, as well as tantric yoga) to seeing sex therapists and changing my diet. Nothing seems to work. Sex is a huge part of a relationship and is one of the main ways to express your love, but I have faced nothing but frustration in this aspect of my relationship with women.It is usually possible to learn to delay ejaculation by identifying one’s point of “ejaculatory inevitability”, then practising the art of taking a controlled pause before it overtakes. It is best to first try this “stop-start” technique during masturbation. Once a man is able to halt his race to ejaculation during self-pleasuring, he can try to achieve it during manual or oral stimulation by a partner, or during intercourse – ideally beginning with what is, for him, the least exciting.This latter part of the protocol is best tried with an understanding and willing partner. And on this note, it is worth remembering that not all women enjoy prolonged intercourse in fact, some much prefer to have a short period of thrusting – especially those who mainly reach orgasm through manual or oral stimulation. In fact, if you learn to pleasure partners to orgasm without engaging your penis – before or after you have ejaculated – they will be highly satisfied and are unlikely to complain about shorter intercourse.You seem to have erroneously come to simply labeled yourself as an “early ejaculator”’ when you are a man with a wide range of attributes that must make you desirable to a partner and worthy of love. Try, therefore, to gain a broader perspective regarding all your positive qualities, and appreciate what you can contribute to a relationship.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@the (please don’t send attachments).

It remains superb.Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink.But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man.The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago.It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require.There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets. Now Lord Carmont, a judge who handed down punishment like an outraged god, is remembered with longing. He is accorded the honour of having diminished razor slashing. The knife has taken its place and the convenient broken bottle remains.Extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c2e276009409df9ebe385ff76d717751938b04b/127_441_5615_3369/master/5615.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03497d90759d502318f73c98782c31c2","title":"hmrc spending on debt collectors up by more than 500 in three years","story":"2017 figure of £39.1m suggests it may be stepping up pressure on those who cannot pay tax billsUsing a private debt collection agency is one of several ways HMRC chases outstanding taxes – it has a relationship with 12 different agencies that can pursue debtors on its behalf – and its strategy may be working: in October 2017, HMRC declared that unpaid tax was at a “record low” as a result of a crackdown on avoidance, evasion and noncompliance.However, the department has also come under fire for using debt collectors to pursue people whose tax credits were overpaid.UHY Hacker Young said the sharp rise in spending on private-sector debt collectors “could suggest HMRC may be stepping up the pressure on people who can’t pay their tax bills as it continues its dash for cash”.It added that the taxman had little day-to-day control over these firms, whose attitude towards debt collecting “could be seen as more aggressive than that of HMRC”.The UK’s “tax gap” – the difference between the amount of tax that should be paid and how much is actually collected – was estimated to be £34bn in 2015-16, HMRC said last October. Inidual consumers accounted for £3.6bn of this.An HMRC spokesman said it had used debt collection agencies for a number of years as an “effective and efficient” way to collect tax.He added: “They operate under strict codes of conduct to pursue debt and we expect them to uphold those codes at all times.“Where someone thinks they will have problems paying the amount due, they should get in touch straight away. All requests for further time to pay an amount due are considered inidually based on the facts of the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae347ba8fd932e1103473f31e8a96c7174edb6aa/0_142_8824_5295/master/8824.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c303aef398a5680f897728161131622","title":"lifestyle club london members fees rights","story":"It was when Paolo Sanchez* needed to find affordable accommodation in London that he was lured by a Facebook ad offering a large, attractive room for a reasonable rate. Cleaning, utilities, broadband and council tax were thrown in. He applied, and moved into a eight-bedroom house-share in Hackney for £900 a month. Only then did he realise what he had let himself in for.“The agent can come and go without notice and make a judgment on how tidy it is and, if they don’t like it, can fine all the occupants,” he says. “Three times people have been in our property. Most worrying, they can terminate the contract at any point giving us seven days to move out.”The company, Lifestyle Club London, is a lettings agency calling itself a “membership club”. Those who sign up are, it claims, able to make the property they choose a principal residence for as long as they wish, or move between any other of its properties with 24 hours’ notice.Instead of a deposit, it requires a nonrefundable £200 joining fee and a refundable membership fee, worth one month’s rent, which is, essentially, a deposit. “Members” then pay a monthly rate. The company compares itself to gig-economy firms such as Airbnb and Uber, which skirt around the usual rules to offer flexibility.The catch is hidden in the terms and conditions, which make extraordinary reading. Tenants, or “members”, must maintain and replace white goods at their own expense and leave them in situ when they leave. If they require extra furniture they must pay half the cost and leave it for club use. Club staff are entitled to inspect rooms unannounced at any time and if “gross breaches” are identified the membership fee is withheld. “Gross breaches” can include the inevitable consequences of a large household. Sanchez, 22, and his eight housemates were fined £90 for leaving dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and £225 for removing graphic print-outs taped to the fridge warning of penalties for drug taking and dirty kitchens.“We’re struggling to understand our position,” he says. “They have the power to create new fines essentially from nothing, and when one of the housemates moved out, the club refused to return his £600 deposit. We fear they intend to do that with all of us.”Ever since the 1977 Protection from Eviction Act, landlords and lettings agents have sought ways around laws enshrining the rights of tenants. Many blur the legal distinction between “assured shorthold tenants”, who have exclusive rights to the accommodation and cannot be evicted without a court order, and “licensees” who typically occupy a hostel run by a registered social landlord, a holiday let or spare bedroom in a family home. They have fewer legal rights and can be evicted without a court order.Lifestyle Club London appears to be an example of a lettings agent exploiting a legal grey area. Set up last August by 30-year-old Estonian Tiina Lehtla with capital assets of just £1, it seeks to imply its “members” are licensees, rather than tenants. Its Companies House registration – Lifestyle Club LSC Ltd – says it operates “housing association” real estate. But it is not a registered housing association and its website invites private landlords to add properties to its portfolio.The penalties, right to unannounced access, “membership fee” and “monthly contributions” rather than rent create the impression residents do not have exclusive rights over the rooms they rent. At a stroke, this removes any of the rights of an assured shorthold tenancy, such as government-backed deposit protection and protection from eviction.According to Robert Bolwell, a specialist in landlord and tenant law with Dutton Gregory LLP: “Even if someone renting a room does not have a formal tenancy agreement, since Lifestyle Club LSC is not a registered social landlord, it is difficult to see how the company can avoid the provisions of the Protection from Eviction Act and simply terminate their right to accommodation. The courts have long said that one should not look at labels when determining the nature of a contract. If the arrangement looks like a tenancy and smells like a tenancy, you may well have a ‘tenancy’, no matter what a landlord decides to call the arrangement.”Lifestyle Club London trades from an address in the London borough of Islington. Last August, Islington trading standards successfully prosecuted a lettings agent, Green Live, for stating two of its tenants were “licensees” and refusing to register their deposits with a protected scheme, or allow them to challenge an eviction notice.In what is thought to be the first case of its kind in the country, the agent was fined £11,000 under the Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 for issuing two sham licences. Trading standards says it is aware of Lifestyle Club London, but declines to confirm whether it is investigating.Lifestyle Club London says that the flexibility it offers members outweighs what it admits are “disadvantages”. “It is true that under our agreements you are not under statutory protections, but on the other side you have much more flexibility.“You can upgrade, downgrade, move in and out or relocate between club properties on your own terms and with very short notice without having the liability of a tenancy agreement. We simply came up with a new concept which some might call questionable but, likewise, so could the practices of Airbnb and Uber.”It claims that members share properties with a resident landlord, which makes them licensees. Sanchez says there is not one in his house. Moreover, he says his requests to transfer to another club property have been stalled and there are no properties listed on the website or anywhere else, for “members” to choose from.According to housing charity Shelter, Sanchez’s predicament is symptomatic of an overheated property market and official inertia has left young people on tight budgets particularly vulnerable.Lifestyle Club London may not be breaking the law but mayor Sadiq Khan has committed to cracking down on lettings agents who do, last year releasing a “rogue landlord and agent checker” to name and shame private landlords and letting agents who have been prosecuted or fined.Legislation in 2014 made it mandatory for lettings agents and property management firms to register with an approved arbitration scheme. Lifestyle Club London directs complainants to the Shared Accommodation Providers Association, a dormant company whose phone number and email address are out of service.However, it’s also signed up to the officially approved Property Redress Scheme (PRS) which can expel members who do not comply with its rulings when a complaint is upheld. But it does not check their terms and conditions comply with its code of practice before accepting their membership. An expelled company can no longer trade legitimately.Sanchez and his housemates can complain to PRS, but ultimately their contract would have to be tested in court. As he says: “Lifestyle Club holds all the cards. I’m actually happy with the accommodation, but the instability is very worrying.“Many of us are students and to lose our home and a month’s rent would leave us struggling to survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59efa73ccc96d3ba12554f2da4c10fd6dbf03a2f/0_113_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a0a87f2c4280b76fa763c83015b125b","title":"biopic grime pioneer wiley development director adam smith","story":"Trespass Against Us director Adam Smith will direct story of the Bow MC who rose to the top of the chartsWiley, the east London MC and one of the key pioneers of grime, is to be the subject of a biopic, according to Variety.Adam Smith will direct the feature. His previous directorial credits include the Michael Fassbender film Trespass Against Us, the Chemical Brothers documentary Don’t Think and episodes of Doctor Who, Little Dorrit and Skins. The film will tell Wiley’s story from his youth in Bow, east London, as part of the Pay As U Go garage crew, before creating his harsh, innovative “eskibeat” production style that became synonymous with grime. He then crossed over into pop, scoring chart-topping singles both solo and with the group Roll Deep, nurturing a new generation of MCs before returning to his grime roots.“This is my life, my highs and lows, but it’s not really all about me,” Wiley said. “When I make music, help the scene or even do something like this, it’s like I’m not alone any more. It’s for people who grew up like me. I’m doing it to help people who are lost like me.”Smith also directed the video for Wiley’s debut solo single, 2004’s Wot U Call It?, and said: “Meeting Wiley and seeing what he and his friends were creating was a huge inspiration to me. Making a film about this incredible talent and his story 15 years later is very exciting.”The script is being written by poet, playwright and librettist Sabrina Mahfouz, who said on Twitter: “This is DREAMS on multiple levels so if u go to east London today u will see my smile stretch central line lengths.” No casting details have been announced.The biopic will be produced by Pulse Films, which is developing other music-film projects, including a documentary version of Lizzy Goodman’s account of New York’s early-00s garage rock scene, Meet Me in the Bathroom, and has produced documentaries with Katy Perry, LCD Soundsystem, Arcade Fire, Nick Cave and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/367f96bdfb0fdf9666033827c066ef93b0a0a04d/0_98_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbce66d74006a832956952710cb36fbe","title":"share your tributes and memories of tessa jowell","story":"How did the politician and cancer research campaigner, who died on Saturday, touch your life?Dame Tessa Jowell, who died on Saturday at the age of 70, has been described as the “people politician” by many paying tribute to her life and career.Figures from across the political spectrum praised her work on Sure Start, a flagship scheme to support children in the early years, her success in bringing the Olympic Games to London and her later campaigning on cancer research.The government announced on Sunday an increase in funding for brain cancer research in tribute to Jowell, who was recently called “an inspiration” for her speeches after being diagnosed.We would like to hear from readers whose lives she touched through her career or personal life, and to highlight some of your memories as part of our coverage.Did you meet Jowell in a personal or professional capacity?

If we did it like that we could get on and do it. It can’t work in the long term, you can’t expect developers to continue to produce for the population’s social needs at this level. It should come from general taxation.”Madelin’s suggestion will raise eyebrows in the notoriously profit-driven property industry as it implies increased taxes on its profits. But he is a respected figure who led the regeneration of King’s Cross in London as well as Brindley place in Birmingham and his remarks reflect growing frustration that the system is not only failing to deliver enough cheap housing, it is also a drag on development.He made his proposal as British Land submitted one of the UK’s largest planning applications for a £3bn regeneration of Surrey Quays in east London, with 3,000 homes, up to six skyscrapers and several new corporate headquarters on a site stretching across 53 acres – similar in size to the regeneration of King’s Cross. It is located about 20 minutes’ walk from the City of London, between Shoreditch and Peckham, two rapidly gentrifying areas, on the London overground line. Some 35,000 people already live in the Rotherhithe peninsula, where the development will take place.The total number built, including with state funding, fell from 61,090 in 2011 to 41,530 in 2017.Madelin believes that by avoiding the current haggling between council officers and developers about how much they should contribute to affordable homes, the government could regain control of how much and when much-needed affordable housing could be built.“I find it nonsensical that we go through these viability assessments,” he said. ‘If you have a shortage of cars then you wouldn’t get motor manufacturers to subsidise people who can’t afford a decent car.”The Surrey Quays site is at present occupied by swaths of surface car parking, a 1980s shopping centre and the disused Daily Mail printworks which is currently acting as a 3,000-capacity electronic dance music venue.The planning application features towers rising up to 46 storeys which will have striking views of the Shard, the City and Canary Wharf, all of which are within two miles. Canada Water, an enclosed former dock will be the centre of about 120 acres of open space which will feature walking trails including one, potentially, that winds up and over the exterior of a new entertainment venue. Madelin said he hoped to inspire people to engage in the Italian pastime of “passegiatta” – promenading, a pursuit not normally linked with the Rotherhithe peninsula."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfac9079add8a210c487509a47b996b0630bf82/0_124_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efd49719519f831196c07691614add4f","title":"county cricket surrey v yorkshire somerset v hants and more live","story":"Ooops, after a period of steadiness, Ireland lose 2 for 1.

Before the start Jack Leach, potential matchwinner here today, potential Test player next week, was in the nets, practising his batting. Jason Kerr, the first team coach was hurling balls with the dog ball thrower. Leach was struck on the left hand, clearly in considerable pain and promptly departed to the pavilion. The home supporters are anxiously waiting to see whether he takes the field in a few minutes. Will let you know.Hello! Welcome to the final day of this round of Championship games - the last for a while. Of course the sun is out, the elderflower nearly in bloom and the season off to a flyer. Four games remain in play today:Surrey v Yorkshire: Surrey 414 Yorkshire 229 and 142 for 5 (Bairstow 25, Leaning 13 Virdi 3-52) trail Surrey by 43 runs.All eyes are on Jonny Bairstow after reports that Ed Smith has his eye on handing the gloves to Ben Foakes and moving YJB up the order, which may have contributed to Bairstow’s furious hitting in the first innings. But he’ll do well to extricate Yorkshire from this mess. Yesterday there were three wickets for off-spinner Amar Virdi including Joe Root for 23, who had been out earlier the same day for 14 – both times to 19 year olds. Sam Curran was awarded his county cap after taking 6-54 in Yorkshire’s first innings, becoming the fourth youngest Surrey player to be capped, and the fourth youngest to 100 wickets after Waqar Younis, Martin Bicknell and Jack CrawfordSomerset v Hampshire: Somerset 506 Hampshire 231 and 178 for 2 (Vince 63, Amla 86) trail Somerset by 97 runsThis could be a thriller, watching Vince - in his last innings before the Test team is chosen - and Amla try to bat out the day.  Middlesex v Gloucestershire: Middlesex 455-8 dec Gloucestershire 210 and 66 for 2 (Roderick 6, Bracey 5)trail Middlesex by 179 runs.Gloucestershire will do very well to escape here and Derbyshire v Durham: Derbyshire 427 and 1-0 (Slater 0, Reece 1) Durham 520. Derbyshire trail Durham by 92 runswhich has draw written all over it.A thriller at New Road where Essex came from behind to win by 32 runs, with Worcester now cut adrift at the bottom of the table. Lancashire beat Nottinghamshire by an innings and 67 runs to register their first win of the season, with nine wickets for Graham Onions and six for Jimmy Anderson. In Division two, Warwickshire beat Northants by six wickets, thanks to a century from Will Rhodes, and already look a pretty safe bet to bounce back to Division one at the end of the season. Northants can already taste the grain of the wooden spoon . And in two relatively low scoring games, Leicestershire beat Glamorgan by three, yes three, runs for their third Championship win since 2012, and Kent beat Sussex by 58 and kicked them out of second place. Matt Henry took ten wickets in the match. In other news: Ireland are following on in their first Test against Pakistan at Malahide where the weather is an unhelpful grey today and where Mick Jagger was spotted yesterday. Jos Buttler hit an unbeaten 94 for Rajasthan Royals – his fifth consecutive IPL fifty since being promoted to open, which equals Virender Sehwag record.

I mention this not only because I am a virtue-signalling monster but also because one of the young women asked something that brought me up short: “How should we react, as young feminists, to older women who don’t seem to support us?”I sat there and goldfished for a moment, keenly aware that these freshly minted teenage minds sat among their esteemed “older women” teachers. But this is one of the issues I have been grappling with in my debut play, 3Women, which is about three generations of the same family, aged 18, 40, and 65. They come together in an increasingly claustrophobic hotel suite the night before a wedding, ostensibly to enjoy some family bonding time. As more wine is ordered and drunk, the gloves come off, and there are old scores to settle.The drama and comedy of three women getting tipsy and having it out is immensely enjoyable and satisfying to write. But I also wanted the characters – Eleanor, Suzanne and Laurie – to talk about feminism, from a baby boomer’s proud memories of her suffragette grandmother, via the Generation X-era of self-knowledge, self-determination, therapy and healing, to now, with the millennials’ gender fluidity and their future facing dreams of artificial wombs and true equality for all permutations of humanity.So, in answer to the question regarding older women, my immediate response was: “Have a little empathy.” The women of Eleanor’s generation propelled feminism at an incredible pace through the postwar decades, and yet have not always been able to benefit personally and professionally in the ways I have, and those born after me. They were the architects of social change, but they couldn’t live in the house they built because they were still expected to conform to social stereotypes their mothers had to submit to. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be sometimes, even for the most generous of spirit. Let’s listen to those women. In fact, let’s all listen to each other, across the generations. We all have our stories to tell. If we fight, we can’t progress. And there are many vested interests in keeping us fighting.3Women is a play I have been wanting to write for several years, but as is often the way, other projects came up. I got pregnant and had a baby, and then there are all the other little pressures that life throws at you. Suddenly, last September, I had a strong desire to write it, and write it quickly. And the timing was right. Because the past year has been an immensely inspiring time for me, and for many other women. For the first time ever, I properly reported an incident of sexual harassment. I told a man in the street who demanded a smile that I didn’t feel like it at that precise second. I cut my own hair. (That was a mistake, in hindsight, and a nice man called Engin sorted it out for me. Thanks, Engin – you did what you could.)People keep asking me three things about 3Women. Is it autobiographical? (It’s not.) Is it part of the #MeToo movement? (It’s not about sexual assault, but I am very happy to be part of the broader tapestry of women finding their voices and using them, loudly.) What is the message? I’m not sure how I feel about messages in writing, and there are no thinly veiled agendas here. But there is a backlog of women’s stories to be told, and I am glad to be one of those with the opportunity to address the imbalance. Women don’t want to replace men – we just want equal airtime.But to do that, we must take ownership of our lives – and it’s never too late. In 3Women, all three characters are starting a new chapter – higher education, marriage, a move to another country – because they believe it will make them happy. And, amazingly, the pursuit of happiness is still considered brave, selfish, or even subversive, especially for women. But this is a moment for roaring, for taking what we want, not for being meek and mild. It shouldn’t be an act of courage to have the life you want. It should be easy. It should be normal. It doesn’t have to be this hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/275b2f8fdbad5de34f52278426cbe0c53f1d784d/533_685_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a5eb90b1954828cd6c8f8bf6a32242","title":"behind scenes baftas 2018 in pictures","story":"Photographer Sarah Lee joins the stars backstage at the Royal Festival Hall, London, for the Virgin TV British Academy Television Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67d49e2d0e72b64983770b0ff62ae35becfe2805/60_656_8036_4821/master/8036.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab8b9d16cb73d932dd283d3abac795fd","title":"unseen photographs of civil rights conflict in birmingham alabama 1963","story":"In spring 1963, African American civil rights activists in Alabama started the Birmingham campaign, a series of sit-ins, boycotts and marches against segregation laws.

Winning the largest number of seats does not automatically guarantee that, however. The other winning blocs would have to agree on the nomination.Sadr and Amiri both came in first in four of the 10 provinces where votes were counted, but the cleric’s bloc won significantly more votes in the capital, Baghdad, which has the highest number of seats.Security and commission sources had earlier said Abadi was leading in the election, which was held on Saturday and is the first since the defeat of Islamic State in the country.The commission did not announce how many seats each bloc had gained and said it would do so after announcing the results from the remaining provinces. A document provided to Reuters by a candidate in Baghdad that was also circulating among journalists and analysts showed results from all 18 provinces. Reuters calculations based on the document showed Sadr had won the nationwide popular vote with more than 1.3m votes and gained 54 of parliament’s 329 seats. He was followed by Amiri with more than 1.2m votes, translating into 47 seats, and Abadi with more than 1m votes and 42 seats.Sadr is one of the few Shia leaders to have distanced himself from Iran and Tehran has publicly stated it would not allow his bloc to govern. He portrays himself as an Iraqi nationalist and last year met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who is staunchly opposed to Iran. In a 2010 election, vice-president Ayad Allawi’s group won the largest number of seats, albeit with a narrow margin, but he was blocked from becoming prime minister, for which he blamed Tehran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42d4d5c98e00d9dded721e6b43d348dc8552c38/0_151_3300_1981/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0022a4dbe981f02ec4984038327f015","title":"former malaysian pm najib razak accused of blocking 1mdb investigation","story":"Ex-head of anti-corruption office claims Najib Razak prevented inquiry into embezzlement of fundsThe former director of Malaysia’s anti-corruption office has lodged a complaint against the former prime minister, Najib Razak, alleging he personally blocked an investigation into the $3.2bn 1MDB scandal.Abdul Razak Idris has claimed that Najib, with the help of other civil servants, prevented a full investigation into the billions embezzled from the government fund overseen by Najib. Najib allegedly transferred $681m of the fund into his own bank account, funding lavish shopping sprees for his wife. He has denied all wrongdoing.An investigation of Najib during his time in office cleared him of all wrongdoing, but it was widely seen as a farce and vital documents were concealed or restricted under the official secrets act. The newly-elected prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, on Monday said the that the attorney general responsible has been told to go on leave pending an investigation of his role in allegedly covering up the scandal.“There have been a lot of complaints against the AG but no formal reports. On that basis, we give him a holiday ... once investigations are carried out, then we can suspend him and prevent him from leaving the country,” Mahathir told a news conference.Anger over 1MDB helped his alliance score a stunning election victory last week, ending the 60-year rule of Najib’s coalition.Abdul Razak’s report appears to confirm the allegations that Najib used his power to blockade a full inquiry into the embezzled funds.“I am making this report so investigations on corruption cases, money laundering and such involving KWAP and 1MDB money can be reopened or continued,” said Abdul Razak on Monday.He said he was only reporting the complaint now because when Najib was in power nothing would have been done about it. However, he still expressed fear about turning against his former boss. “Some are also worried about me for boldly coming out to lodge a report but it’s all right,” he said as he entered the anti-corruption headquarters. “I’m already 69 years old. If I die, I die for the country.”Abdul Razak also called on Najib to declare all his assets, including unexplained property.Mahathir has said if Najib was implicated in any wrongdoing he must “face the consequences”.The former prime minister and his wife were put on an immigration blacklist over the weekend to make sure they did not attempt to flee the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe1c0e4e173f2ac7e3428b93d99e5ce2dcded5a/43_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4787b184c02ea8bacc20e987b0205e4e","title":"is your boss secretly or not so secretly watching you","story":"From microchip implants to wristband trackers and sensors that can detect fatigue and depression, new technology is enabling employers to watch staff in more and more intrusive ways. How worried should we be?Last year an American company microchipped dozens of its workers. In a “chip party” that made headlines around the world, employees lined up to have a device the size of a grain of rice implanted under the skin between their thumb and forefinger. At first, Todd Westby, the CEO of Three Square Market, thought only about five or six people – him and a couple of directors, some of the people who worked in the IT department – would volunteer. But of the 90 people who work at the headquarters, 72 are now chipped Westby has a chip in each hand. They can be used to open security doors, log on to computers and make payments at the company’s vending machines.Can he see it taking off at lots of other companies? “Not necessarily,” he says. Or at least not yet. It’s partly a generational thing, he believes. “You may never want to be chipped but if you’re a millennial, you have no problems. They think it’s cool.” There are other uses for it – two months ago, the company (whose core business is selling vending machines and kiosks) started chipping people with dementia in Puerto Rico. If someone wanders off and gets lost, police can scan the chip “and they will know all their medical information, what drugs they can and can’t have, they’ll know their identity.” So far, Three Square Market has chipped 100 people, but plans to do 10,000.The company has just launched a mobile phone app that pairs the chip with the phone’s GPS, enabling the implantee’s location to be tracked. Last week, it started using it with people released from prison on probation, as a replacement for ankle tags, which Westby describes as “intimidating and degrading”. Could he ever see the company using GPS to track its chipped employees? “No,” he says. “There’s no reason to.”Not all firms would agree. Tech companies are coming up with ever more bizarre and intrusive ways to monitor workforces. Last week the Times reported that some Chinese companies are using sensors in helmets and hats to scan workers’ brainwaves and detect fatigue, stress and even emotions such as anger. It added that one electrical company uses brainwave scans to decide how many breaks workers get, and for how long. The technology is used on high-speed train drivers to “detect fatigue and attention loss”. While this sort of technology may have legitimate safety applications – a similar project was carried out with Crossrail workers using wristbands that sensed fatigue – it’s not hard to see how it could creep into other areas.In February, it was reported that Amazon had been granted patents for a wristband that not only tracked workers’ locations in the warehouse as they “picked” items to be dispatched, but could “read” their hand movements, buzzing or emitting a pulse to alert them when they were reaching for the wrong item. In the filing, Amazon describes it as being able to “monitor performance of the placing of the incoming inventory item into the identified storage location by the inventory system worker”.There are tech companies selling products that can take regular screenshots of employees’ work, monitor keystrokes and web usage, and even photograph them at their desks using their computers’ webcams. Working from home offers no protection, as all this can be done remotely. Software can monitor social media usage, analyse language or be installed on employees’ phones to monitor encrypted apps such as WhatsApp. Employees can be fitted with badges that not only track their location, but also monitor their tone of voice, how often they speak in meetings and who they speak to and for how long.Employees have always been watched at work, and technology has always been used to do it. But where it was once a factory foreman with a stopwatch, or workers having to physically clock in and out, now “all of that physical stuff has gone into digital technology”, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School. “It captures things that you weren’t able to capture in the past, like how many keystrokes are people taking, what are they looking at on their screen while they’re at work, what kind of language are they using. And surveillance follows you outside the workplace now.”How much of this is legal? In the UK, employers are allowed to monitor which websites you look at while at work, says Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law Solicitors who specialises in employment law. “However, the device they monitor must be partly or wholly provided by work. Employers must also give prior warning if they are going to monitor your online activity, and should make you aware of the relevant social media policy.” It is also legal to monitor keystrokes, though again employees must be told they will be watched. “In companies where this system is in place, it is not uncommon for employers to speak to employees if they feel that their number of keystrokes is low,” says Landau. “It is worth noting that a high number of keystrokes does not necessarily mean high levels of productivity and vice versa.”Employers could theoretically use your computer’s webcam to see when you’re at your desk but “there should be a justification for such monitoring, and you should be informed of it beforehand. You should also be informed what the pictures will be used for, and how they will be stored.” As for GPS tracking, “a company may track any vehicles that they supply to their staff. However, the data they collect must only be used for the management purposes of the company. Any GPS device is not allowed to be turned on if the employee is using the vehicle for personal reasons outside of work.”Amazon says its scanning devices “are common across the warehouse and logistics sector as well as in supermarkets, department stores and other businesses, and are designed to assist our people in performing their roles”, while the company “ensures all of its associates have easy access to toilet facilities, which are just a short walk from where they are working”. It adds: “Associates are allowed to use the toilet whenever needed. We do not monitor toilet breaks.”Some of Bloodworth’s colleagues, he says, were angry about the level of monitoring – “but it was more cynicism and resignation. Most of the people I met hadn’t been in the job very long or were looking for other jobs. Every job was temporary and it was a workforce completely in flux.” Has Bloodworth seen the future? Will we all be monitored like this by our bosses in years to come? Possibly, he says. “One of the things that has arisen in response to the book is that people say work is going to be automated anyway, or workers need to be more flexible, as if this is the way of the future and it’s inevitable, which I think is quite dangerous. Amazon can get away with this because of political choices and because the trade union movement is quite weak. I think other businesses will look at Amazon, see they have had success with this business model – and seek to replicate it.”For his book Working the Phones, Jamie Woodcock, a sociologist of work at the Oxford Internet Institute, spent six months working in a call centre. You get a sense of the monitoring, he says, “from the moment you walk in. You have TV screens that have everyone’s relative performance to each other displayed. Managers collect data on almost every single part of what you do. Every single phone call I ever made was digitally recorded and stored. In terms of monitoring, it’s like being able to call back every single thing somebody has made on an assembly line and retrospectively judge it for quality. We all make mistakes and we all have bad days, but this kind of monitoring can be made retrospectively to sack people and is used to give people a sense that they could lose their jobs at any moment.”Monitoring is built into many of the jobs that form the so-called “gig economy”. It’s not easy to object to the constant surveillance when you’re desperate for work. What has surprised Spicer is how willingly people in better-paid jobs have taken to it. “Prisoners in the past were forced to wear tracking bands but now we willingly put on step trackers or other kinds of tracking devices given to us by our employers, and in some cases we pay for the privilege.” Companies such as IBM, BP, Bank of America, Target and Barclays have offered their employees Fitbit activity trackers.It is part, Spicer says, of “this whole idea of wanting to improve or optimise yourself. A lot of technology is designed to not just feed back data about your performance to your boss, but also give it to you. I guess they’re also seen as cool or fashionable, so it’s not surprising they’re taken up so readily.”Spicer has watched the shift away from “monitoring something like emails to monitoring people’s bodies – the rise of bio-tracking basically. The monitoring of your vital signs, emotions, moods.” Of Three Square Market’s practice of chipping employees, he says: “You can imagine that slowly extending. You could imagine things like employers asking to have your DNA in the future, and other kinds of data.”Surveillance can have positive applications. It’s necessary (and legally required) in the financial industry to prevent insider trading. It could be used to prevent harassment and bullying, and to root out bias and discrimination. One interesting study last year monitored emails and productivity, and used sensors to track behaviour and interaction with management, and found that men and women behaved almost identically at work. The findings challenged the belief that the reason women are not promoted to senior levels is that they are less proactive or have fewer interactions with leaders, and simply need to “lean in”.Still, says, Woodcock, “we need to have a conversation in society about whether work should be somewhere that you’re surveilled”. That need is perhaps most urgent where low-paid, insecure jobs are concerned. “If you work in the gig economy, you have a smartphone,” Woodcock points out, and that smartphone can be used to track you. “I think because many of these workplaces don’t have traditional forms of organisation or trade unions, management are able to introduce these things with relatively little collective resistance.”The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is well aware of the issues of monitoring and data collection. James Farrar is the chair of its United Private Hire Drivers branch, and the Uber driver who won a legal battle against the company last year for drivers’ rights. “They do collect an awful lot of information,” he says. “One of the things they will report to you on a daily basis is how good your acceleration and braking has been. You get a rating. The question is: why are they collecting that information?” Uber also monitors “unusual movements” of the phone when someone is driving (implying it knows if someone is using their phone while at the wheel) and, of course, tracks cars and drivers by GPS.Not all surveillance is bad, says Farrar. In some ways, he would like more. He was assaulted by a passenger and is calling for CCTV in all vehicles, partly for the safety of drivers. “There is a role for surveillance technology,” he says. Ironically, when Farrar went for a meeting with Uber to discuss the assault, the company made him turn his phone off to prove he wasn’t recording it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9812a1109874366b030f7e2d3ff34ede1cabeb59/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838fd0df808bd610ab9e840f2c8f4475","title":"italy m5s five star movement league parties name prime minister","story":"Leaders will submit policy programme to president in which they are likely to take tougher stance on EUItaly’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and its far-right partner, the League, are preparing to present their government programme to President Sergio Mattarella on Monday and name a prime minister.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, and M5S counterpart Luigi Di Maio, worked over the weekend in Milan on a policy document in which they are expected to take a tougher approach towards illegal immigration and the EU.“If the rules, parameters and constraints imposed by Europe do not change, Italy suffocates. This seems to be a shared commitment,” Salvini said.Italian media reported that Di Maio had told the president’s office on Sunday night they would be ready to submit their plan to Mattarella and name a prime minister on Monday. Earlier in the day, the 31-year-old said the pair were “writing history” and needed time, but that talks had been positive.If Mattarella endorses the candidate, programme and cabinet lineup then he could nominate a prime minister on Monday, paving the way for a government to be sworn in this week before facing a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament. However, Mattarella warned over the weekend that he would not be a “pushover”. Di Maio and Salvini will meet in Rome on Monday before updating the president. It is still unclear who Italy’s next prime minister could be, although Di Maio said it would be “a politician and not a technician”. The person is expected to be from neither from the League nor M5S and will also probably be someone who will heed Mattarella’s warnings against nationalism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa5fe62765985a1355632eb848dbbfd04f769914/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5a710881b413eecc095cd8f13ed59d","title":"timor leste hero xanana gusmao heads back into power","story":"Timor-Leste independence hero Xanana Gusmão is expected to be appointed prime minister again after the country’s second parliamentary election in less than a year.Gusmão’s National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) party joined forces with the Popular Liberation party, led by another former president, Taur Matan Ruak, and the youth-focused Khunto to form the Change for Progress Alliance (AMP), which defeated Fretilin, led by Gusmão’s frequent rival Mari Alkatiri.The campaign was marred by tensions and violence, and both leaders have in the past faced accusations of improper conduct – including by Ruak when he was president. Timorese journalist Raimundos Oki reported 18 CNRT supporters were injured in an alleged attack by Fretilin supporters last week. However, election day appeared to be peaceful, with the process and high turnout praised by the United Nations Development Program and election observers.Gusmão was prime minister from 2007 to 2015 and Timor-Leste’s first president after independence, from 2002 to 2007.Alkatiri was the country’s first prime minister, briefly resigning after a political crisis in 2006 which included accusations of assassination plans. He led Fretilin to win the biggest number of seats in 2007, but the Gusmão-led CNRT formed a larger coalition and was able to form government.The 2017 election produced no clear winner. Opposition parties blocked legislation, and in January the president, Lú-Olo Guterres, called for fresh elections to end hostilities.In recent years, Alkatiri has led an ambitious infrastructure development project in Oecusse, as part of the government’s attempts to ersify the economy before oil reserves – on which Timor-Leste’s economy depends – dry up.In March the government signed a maritime border treaty with Australia, largely ending decades of diplomatic negotiations, which included accusations of spying by Australian officials, and hostility over the ision of billions of dollars worth of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea.Last week the  revealed Australia’s decision to formally recognise the violent invasion and occupation of Timor-Leste by Indonesia in the 1970s was largely driven by its desire to secure an advantageous maritime border. The prime minister elect, Gusmão, had led the treaty negotiations with Australia but just days before the treaty was signed he accused Australia of collusion. He did not attend the signing.The exact ision of the oilfields remains to be decided. Timor-Leste hopes to have the gas piped back to its purpose-built processing plant on its southern coast. Australia, and reportedly the proponents, want it to go to Darwin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3490522.1525967721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two sky customers ask where s our free telly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Sky customers had 90 days to activate the “claim” emails. Photograph: David JonesPA WireWe got two almost identical queries from readers in connection with an offer from Sky that was not honoured.First up was Tom. He bought a Sky package last November that included a new television. “The contract started on December14th. However, the television never arrived. I emailed about it in January and again in March but got no reply. Then I got an email on April 16th to say that Sky could not collect a monthly payment as there was an issue with my Visa card.”He replied to the mail and said he was out of the country and would sort out the card issue when he got home. “I once again asked about the television. I then got another email about the card payment, so I phoned them and sorted out the payment and asked about the television, only to be told that I was sent an email last December stating that I had to click on the email to activate the sending of the television. I don’t remember seeing this email but do accept that it’s probably there,” he says.“But then the sting in the tail, when he said that since it was over 90 days since that email in December, the television offer had expired and could not be reactivated and that he was very sorry for my situation. I was furious and told him so politely, but he apologised and said that there was nothing he could do. Just wondering if I have any comeback in your opinion.”Then there was Peter. “I signed up to Sky Q in November 2017. As part of new subscription a flatscreen TV was offered. When it did not arrive, I contacted Sky last week. They advised that they had sent me an email, to which I failed to respond. It went into my spam box, I found it yesterday! Now, as I am outside the 90-day period I am no longer eligible to receive the offer. Have my consumer rights been respected here?”Whatever about rights and terms and conditions, what strikes us is that the two stories are identical and it made us wonder how many other people missed this Sky offer because the mail containing the link they had to click to activate the offer went into their spam folder.We contacted the company and\u0026nbspa spokeswoman said that in both cases the customer signed up and upon activation was subsequently sent the “claims” email. “It clearly states in these ‘claims’ emails, online and in any promo T\u0026ampCs, that the reward must be claimed within 90 days.”She said Sky had no record of the mails Tom says he sent in January and March asking about the television. “We’re not sure what email address he sent it to, but it did not reach us. Had it reached us, he would have received a response within 48 hours and notes would have been placed on his account to support this,” she said.She said that in Peter’s case, he “acknowledges that he received the email and, as mentioned previously, the onus was on him to claim the reward. The configuration of the spam mailbox is managed by the mail client and is not something that we can control. In all of the agent briefings we give to agents, we specifically call this out as a conversation point to mention to the customer when signing up.”She also said that “while Sky is not at fault, we will be contacting these two customers in an effort to resolve the matter.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3494453.1526283150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses in border area anxious over brexit impact on jobs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcern over recruitment post-Brexit was one  the key findings of an initiative undertaken to help inform a new strategy for health care staff in Northern Ireland.

Around £2.3 billion a year is spent employing those who work in the public sector.Key targets outlined in the 2026 strategy include:- Explore and establish non-salary incentive programmes as a means of recruiting andor retaining people andor dealing with pressures in less popular specialties and locations.- Set up and roll out a regional health and social care careers service targeted at the existing workforce, young people from the age of 14, and possible returners to service.- Develop and integrate new ways of working and jobs across health and social care, and fund sustainable training and development programmes that meet service needs.Northern Ireland department of health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said: “This strategy recognises that we need to meet the challenge of making the Northern Ireland health and social care sector an employer of choice, by ensuring that the service is fully staffed, well-trained, and that workers can balance their work around the other commitments in their lives.” - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister criticises use of children with Downs Syndrome on referendum postersPalestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future stateThe boy\u0026rsquos Polish father was one of 16 parachutists to jump from the aircraft prior to crashPlan published to modernise workplace practices in Northern Ireland health serviceInquiry investigating whether Garda boss directed smear campaign against McCabe\u0026lsquoThe station is just a building with an insulated roof\u0026rsquo, says officer in MayoCommittee has not convened this year and is being \u0026lsquoignored\u0026rsquo by Minister, says Fianna F\u0026aacuteilTrio of rural areas launch online campaigns in bid to save services and grow populationHSE will provide tests to combat \u0026lsquoworry\u0026rsquo, assessing GP-service impact after three monthsAssistant Commissioner John O\u0026rsquoDriscoll believes current sentences not acting as a deterrentCouncil said it will consider using coloured paving to help avoid confusion\u0026lsquoWe forgive but we never forget, and this is something we\u0026rsquore never going to forget\u0026rsquoOn average one home burglary per day reported to Garda in each of 26 countiesPublic Accounts Committee will continue to hold hearings on CervicalCheck controversyDublin open to \u0026lsquonew thinking\u0026rsquo but will be inflexible on proposals for Border infrastructureKildare, Meath and Wicklow authorities urged to recategorise some people on listFirefighters spend nine hours tackling blaze that nearly engulfed Castletown Road schoolWinifred Byrne who lost family members in 1981 succeeds in 14-year dispute over paymentPilot programme a joint endeavour by HSE and Department of Education to boost supports"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3494446.1526287931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"david taylor to appear before disclosures tribunal today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupt David Taylor speaking to the media at the scene of a shooting in Dublin in 2013.

Photograph: Nigel McDowellUlster UniversityThere has been a drop off in students selecting the Derry campus of Ulster University as their first preference for third-level studies, and a decline in job applications for posts there since the Brexit vote.Magee – as the university’s Derry campus is known – is Ireland’s only Border university.The most westerly of any UK campus and situated less than five miles from the Border with Donegal, almost 10 per cent of its more than 4,000 students and 20 per cent of its staff come from the Republic of Ireland. “Magee is a north west of the island campus as opposed to a Northern Ireland campus,” says Ulster University’s vice-chancellor and president, Professor Paddy Nixon. This is the philosophy behind much of Magee’s recent expansion. Ulster University’s long-planned graduate medical school, scheduled to open next year, will be the only such facility north of Galway, or west of Belfast. In February the university – along with the North West Regional College in Derry – signed a memorandum of understanding with Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the Donegal Education and Training Board to improve access to higher and further level education and training in what is increasingly referred to as the “North West City region”. The reality, says Nixon, is that Derry is a cross-Border city – and Brexit represents a huge challenge for both the city and its university, and its impact is already being felt. “During this uncertain period, we are seeing a drop off in a whole range of applications for jobs, requests for us to lead European grants, and students choosing us as a first preference,” he says. There are concerns over the continuation of research and other funding, and there has been a “significant exodus” of EU staff on fixed-term contracts. An associate head of school has already left to take up a position in Sligo another academic the university tried to recruit from the Republic turned down the post because of uncertainty over pensions, exchange rates, and concerns over the UK’s attitude towards Europe post-Brexit. “Our competitors are not actually the universities in the UK, they’re the universities in the South,” Nixon confirms. “100 miles down the road you’re in Galway or Dublin and the staff get good research funding and a good living and working environment. “We’ve got the same, but those universities remain in a European context. It’s a huge challenge for us.” While student numbers will not be affected – any vacant places will be filled by students from Northern Ireland – he is concerned the lack of ersity would be detrimental to the nature and identity of the Magee campus. “It wouldn’t be negative in terms of the finances of the university, but I think it would be negative in terms of the culture of the university.“For people who go through the Northern Ireland system, more often than not further and higher education is the first time it is a truly open and erse and culturally accepting space for everybody, and we as a university will always fight to maintain that.”Much of the difficulty for the university lies in the lack of clarity. “That’s the killer at the moment – we don’t have clear, unequivocal statements,” he points out. Brexit is one of the top two issues on the university’s risk register and its Brexit readiness group is at work preparing the university for all scenarios. The university has appealed for clarification regarding the future mobility of students and staff, for Erasmus students to be considered on an all-island basis, and for the introduction of post-study work visas for students – a measure which already exists in the Republic. “I would say we are no wiser than the day we got the result of the referendum vote. It’s limiting the ability of the universities in the UK, but particularly in Northern Ireland, to compete on a global basis.” This is exacerbated by the lack of political leadership in the North. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government for more than a year, since its Assembly at Stormont collapsed following a scandal over a botched renewable energy scheme. “At this point in time Northern Ireland is challenged because it doesn’t have that clear leadership in terms of an Executive, and we absolutely, unquestionably need that political leadership,” says Nixon. “I’m even more worried that there’s nobody in there lobbying for the best interests of Northern Ireland in this debate.”While Nixon is clear that the university was opposed to Brexit – it was among the signatories of a letter from UK universities stating that they wanted to remain in the EU – he is also concerned that the “vacuum of leadership” prevents Northern Ireland accessing any of the potential benefits of Brexit too. “If Brexit goes ahead then Northern Ireland is uniquely placed to be perhaps a halfway house between the EU and the UK, and there are some opportunities in terms of economic or inward investment that could flow from that,” he says. In the longer term he is not convinced it will have a significant effect on the university except that “we’re part of a global community and – real or perceived – there’s an isolationist piece to this Brexit debate, and if we are perceived to be isolating ourselves from a global research community then it will be significantly detrimental to us. “But at this point, it’s all guesswork.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"barnier on brexit ireland has the full support of all european states","story":"  April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by June   April 30, 2018DUP leader Arlene Foster says Barnier does not understand unionist culture   April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator says preparations must be made for no agreement on visit to Border area   May 1, 2018EU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator presses British for rapid agreement as DUP raises temperature   May 1, 2018Varadkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutions   May 7, 2018Key allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreed "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3494529.1526293213!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland should move embassy to jerusalem israeli government says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA worker hangs a road sign directing to the US embassy in Jerusalem earlier this month. Photograph: Ronen ZvulunReutersIreland should join the US and move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, Israeli government has said. American officials are in Jerusalem for Monday’s relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv to the contested city, a move the Israeli government has embraced but the Palestinians have condemned.Israeli government spokeswoman Michal Maayan said: “We’re inviting Ireland to join because the issue of Jerusalem, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, it’s going to be the capital of Israel whatever future settlement we will arrive with Palestinians.“Hence it’s not really a conflict, not for us, not for future agreements and I think we can see also the reaction amongst the Arab world, the rest of the world,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Monday. Ireland’s embassy to Israel is located in the town of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv. “Everyone thought the sky was going to fall when this resolution passed, when the announcement passed, when we can see that it’s all so natural for the US and other countries. “So we call on Ireland to join this and to move its embassy. And obviously Jerusalem is going to be a complex issue that will be resolved once the Palestinians return to the table to negotiations, this is going to be one of the issues.“But moving embassies to Jerusalem isn’t stopping peace, it’s actually helping peace because it’s helping the Palestinians realise that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state of Israel and it helps them realise a reality that’s very important to us to go further on.”Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognised internationally.The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. They view the relocation of the US embassy as a one-sided move that invalidates America’s role as an impartial peace broker in the region. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyNew Look accused of \u0026#39fat tax\u0026#39 by charging more for outfits after size 16Meghan Markle\u0026#39s half-sister claims responsibility for dad\u0026#39s photoshoot set upIs this the face of Disease X?

However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm and the public will have the opportunity to watch the Royal wedding from their sofas at home.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleNew Look accused of \u0026#39fat tax\u0026#39 by charging more for outfits after size 16Meghan Markle\u0026#39s half-sister claims responsibility for dad\u0026#39s photoshoot set upIs this the face of Disease X?

The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC broadcast will be anchored by Huw Edwards, Kirsty Young and Dermot O\u0027Leary from the grounds of Windsor Castle. The cameras will roll from Saturday morning, as Young and O\u0027Leary cover the build-up from the castle\u0027s moat, whilst newsreader Edwards presents from the equally spectacular roof of the Windsor Guard Room.They will be supported by a team of roaming presenters including The One Show\u0027s Alex Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing champion Ore Oduba, who will capture the excitement on the ground. The BBC has announced that a television licence will not be needed to watch the wedding, allowing communities to screen the event at street parties and gatherings.  ITV\u0027s output will be presented by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, using a purpose-built studio in Windsor, and Sky News will be in Windsor as well, making sure no angle is missed.Live coverage of the ceremony will be broadcast on big screens around the UK, including in Belfast, Salisbury, Leeds, Swansea, Winchester and Portsmouth.It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, travel to Buckingham Palace, after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, 2011As Harry and Meghan will enter the chapel at 12:00 B.S.T, North American viewers will have an early start if they want to catch the action live.   The first footage will be available from CBS\u0027 This Morning, which airs at 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT). NBC takes its entire Today show to Windsor for their coverage beginning at 4:30 E.S.T (1:30 PT), and ABC News and Good Morning America will begin at 5:00 E.S.T (2.00 PT).Meanwhile, BBC America will broadcast a live simulcast of the UK\u0027s BBC One from 4:15 E.S.T (1:15 PT), and HBO begins their live coverage at the more accommodating time of 7:15 E.S.T (4:30 PT). All of these American broadcasters are set to provide online and mobile coverage of the big day,  but ensure you are a paid subscriber to watch BBC America or HBO.Another alternative is to find one of almost 200 cinema screenings across the US for a 10am (local time) screening of ITV\u0027s broadcast, only a few hours after the events unfold in Windsor. Canadian\u0027s can turn to national broadcaster CBC from 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT) for live coverage, or opt to follow their live CBC News blog with updates from the goings-on at Windsor. Whist CBC\u0027s World Report radio programme will air from 6:00 E.S.T (3:00 PT) for a special royal wedding breakfast edition.On the opposite side of the globe, New Zealanders can tune-in from 22:30 for TVNZ\u0027s simulcast of BBC One for the ceremony set to begin at 23:00 Wellington-time.

However, he will miss the event this year to fulfil his role as Prince Harry\u0027s best man.You can expect the wedding to attract a large audience in the UK and abroad. About 27 million Brits and 23 million Americans watched the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.The BBC\u0027s coverage of William and Kate\u0027s wedding attracted 67.2 per cent of the television audience share that day, attracting 18.7 million viewers to BBC One during the ceremony. More than a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby. They were also criticised for using Fearne Cotton to provide coverage from outside Buckingham Palace.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAs excitement builds before the wedding day, a host of broadcasters will deploy in-depth documentaries and extended Harry and Meghan coverage.ITV have already aired a one-off feature entitled Invitation to a Royal Wedding.

The ceremony, which takes place on Saturday May 19, will be held in Windsor it will include two wedding receptions and a carriage procession, as well as the service.Prince Harry and Ms Markle have broken tradition by choosing to hold their wedding on a Saturday, as royal weddings usually take place during the week. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was held on a Friday and the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales was held on a Wednesday on both occasions the public were given an extra bank holiday.While Downing Street have said there are no plans to give Britons a day off for this year\u0027s royal nuptials, pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open until 1am on Friday May 18 and the day of the wedding itself.Amber Rudd, the former Home Secretary, opened a consultation on the plans in January. She said: “The Royal wedding will be a time of national celebration, and we want everyone to be able to make the most of such an historic occasion.“I hope that this relaxation of the licensing hours will allow people to extend their festivities and come together to mark what will be a very special moment for the country.”Here is everything you need to know about how the big day will unfold.WATCH:  How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingThe service will take place at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle\u0026#39s half-sister claims responsibility for dad\u0026#39s photoshoot set upIs this the face of Disease X?

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter.

Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It doesn’t exist.”He said maintaining a seamless frontier was about more than just trade, saying: “If you talk to people about their memories of the past, in the context of the border, you will often end up talking to someone with tears in their eyes.”The customs partnership plan will be examined by Mr Gove and fellow Brexiteer opponent Liam Fox, in a group also including David Lidington, a May loyalist.Meanwhile, two sceptics, Greg Clark and Karen Bradley, will examine the tech-based “max-fac” proposal – requiring border checks – with supporter David Davis.The set-up suggests neither group will reach a decision in favour, unless one member can be “turned”.Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, said: “We are in a farcical situation. Nearly two years after the referendum the cabinet is fighting over two customs options neither of which frankly is workable, neither of which is acceptable to the EU.”He rejected accusations that Labour’s stance was similarly muddled, arguing it backed a “comprehensive customs union” and a “strong single market relationship that hard wires the benefits”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13In addition, the swapping of vital intelligence information is threatened by Ms May’s insistence that the UK will end oversight by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).Meanwhile, the UK is locked in an increasingly bitter row with the EU over its exclusion from the Galileo satellite navigation system – prompting the government to threaten to curb intelligence sharing.Senior figures in Brussels have also accused the UK of trying to blackmail the EU by using its strengths in intelligence and security as a bargaining chip in talks.Now the Lords report has stressed the urgent need to clear up the confusion – with Brexit just 10 months away – calling for “detailed proposals” before the EU summit next month.To do that, Britain needs to decide whether to use its military muscle to try to maintain some influence over joint security missions, the report says.UK to host summit on why six other countries should join the EUMay faces deadlock over Brexit customs rules as both options rubbishedBritain ‘held to ransom’ by Tories pushing hard Brexit, Morgan warnsMay urges public to ‘trust me’ to deliver Brexit amid cabinet rowsEU set to push for six-month extension to Brexit transition period“The current model for third country participation offers a more limited role for the UK after Brexit than that envisaged by the government,” the report adds.“The government will need to decide whether to use the UK’s significant military capabilities as leverage to modify the model for third country participation.“The UK will also need to invest significant resources in Brussels and in member states’ capitals, to maintain influence from outside the structures of the EU.”The key advantage of CSDP missions was their “lower-intensity crisis management”, pulling together military, political, diplomatic, economic and legal aspects, the peers found.The UK’s contribution of personnel was “very limited” – just 2.3 per cent of the total –  but it did provide planning guidance and “assets such as naval vessels and aircraft”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just as we seem set on leaving the EU, we start advising others to join. Government policy would not look out of place in the theatre of the absurd.”Mr Brake said of foreign secretary Boris Johnson: “This just shows how incompetent Boris is. I wouldn’t let him run a bath, let alone the Foreign Office.”Countdown to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The government says the London summit will focus on “facilitating political cooperation” in the region, “strengthening regional security cooperation” and “increasing economic stability with a view to improving the business environment”.The London meeting will follow a summit in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia scheduled for Thursday in which EU leaders, including Theresa May, discuss the future of the region.

This goes beyond party politics - it’s more important than party politics.”The House of Lords voted to make keeping the UK inside the European Economic Area (EEA), and therefore the single market, a negotiating priority – throwing the decision back to MPs.But Labour remains opposed, while vowing to negotiate a “strong single market relationship that hardwires the benefits”, without explaining how that will be possible outside the trading bloc.Mr Miliband was speaking ahead of sharing a platform with Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary, and Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many posed to take photos with the “creature”.Though authorities suspect the carcass is simply the decomposed body of a whale, local people expressed their shock at the arrival of such an unusual object.Bizarre deep-sea creatures wash up on Scottish beachResident Tam Maling said: \u0027\u0027An earthquake is heading for Oriental Mindoro.

They now intend to dispose of the remains.Fishery Law Enforcement Officer Vox Krusada said: \u0027\u0027Today we just gathered a samples of it for further analysis.\u0027\u0027For now we can say its a whale, but the exact species is still unknown. The tissue samples are now sent to our lab for DNA analysis.Residents flock to see the \u0027globster\u0027 sea creature in Oriental Mindoro province, Philippines, (ViralPress)\u0027\u0027The local government of Gloria will now bury the carcass. And damn it smells awful. It smells like something from another planet. \u0027\u0027I really experienced the full power of its smell because I’m the one who took the tissue samples. I almost puked. I felt better after taking a bath but the stench still lingers in my nose.\u0027\u0027Globsters have been found on beaches all over the world, with the term first used to describe an unidentified carcass that washed up in western Tasmania in 1960.Though it is often difficult for observers to establish the provenance of these marine enigmas, scientific analysis has invariably revealed they belonged to known underwater creatures including sperm whales and basking sharks.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many of these weapons are used to injure people and animals and it is high time some regulation was introduced.There is also an issue with the weapons being able to be left around the home, potentially for children or young people to find.I am continuing a dialogue with the Home Office and will be raising further concerns about crossbows with them.The MP told how constituents had raised concerns with her about a man with mental health problems who repeatedly fired his crossbow inside his home.She said: It is a major concern to me that this man was able to buy himself a crossbow when he clearly was an unsuitable owner. Yet no checks were made.Helen Goodman, MP for Bishop Auckland, and Jenny Chapman, MP for Darlington, have also called for a Government crackdown. Ms Goodman said: These are seriously dangerous weapons that have no reason to be on sale to the general public. In 1997, the Labour Government did the right thing and banned the sale of handguns following the tragedy of the Dunblane massacre.The current Government needs to take this even further and ban the sale of crossbows entirely before we have another needless tragedy on our hands.I was troubled to discover the ease in which anybody over 18 can purchase a crossbow in England and fully support Helen\u0027s call for the banning of such weapons.Currently, you do not require a licence or registration to own a crossbow, and armed with the internet and a credit card it is possible to have one delivered with very few questions asked.One of Britain\u0027s biggest archery retailers is Merlin Archery which has a store in Bishop Auckland alongside a website which states: On some of the crossbows, the power is so great that cocking the string should be an Olympic event.It also boasts of its pistol crossbows: Small and cheap, but they pack a punch. These are age restricted (18 years or older) and must be used with extreme caution! Not suitable for children. Not suitable for some adults, come to think of it. But if used responsibly they are great fun.Oliver Clayton-Smith, from Merlin Archery, said: There\u0027s no denying they are dangerous. There\u0027s an age restriction which helps a little but it\u0027s difficult because they are classed as sporting goods.In theory, there\u0027s no difference between the bow and a crossbow, the main difference being a crossbow is much easier to use because it has a sight and you pull a trigger.Crossbows may be far more powerful than an air rifleMr Clayton-Smith insisted staff do everything they can to stop crossbows falling into the wrong hands but they have limited powers and often rely on their discretion. He said: The law is fairly lax because this is sporting equipment.We check their driving licence or passport and if someone cannot produce that we don\u0027t sell them.The same kind of process happens online. If someone wants an age-related product we send them an email and ask for a copy of their ID. Occasionally people are turned away.A Home Office spokeswoman said: Crossbows are subject to strict controls and retailers are banned from selling them to a person under the age of 18.We keep legislation under review and will consider the risk such weapons pose to public safety and if further measures are needed.Carrying a crossbow in public can be classed as an offence of carrying an offensive weapon, if the police consider there is intent to use the crossbow to cause injury.Glen MinikinPaul Jeeves is targeting the lack of legislationTo my horror I was able to buy an ultra-powerful deadly weapon on one of Britain\u0027s busiest shopping streets in just five minutes.I nervously entered the store in Leeds city centre and was taken aback by the array of weapons including samurai swords, machetes and axes on unguarded display alongside air pistols, rifles and BB guns.I\u0027m looking for a crossbow, I told the assistant who, without questioning, told me they had both a pistolstyle and a rifle-style in stock. Removing the pistol-style model from a hanging display, he told me it had a firing range that would hit a target two full-size football pitch lengths away. It cost \u0026pound39.What about something a bit bigger? I asked.Instantly a deadly Panther 175lb crossbow was placed on the counter. The box promised it was built for power and boasted that the weapon combines tactical style with high performance.This has a range of around 500 yards, revealed the assistant. It\u0027s an incredible piece of kit. It takes about 15 minutes to put together. It is \u0026pound139 and comes with four 16-inch bolts. I was shown how its red dot sight provided sniper-style accuracy.I volunteered that I was buying it as a present, wondering if they would need to know about the recipient. They didn\u0027t.Brilliant, I\u0027ll take it, I said. I had taken my passport but I was not asked for any ID nor told to complete any records.It had taken little more than five minutes.There is no suggestion the store had broken the law.DYSONThe use of crossbows for hunting is banned in the UK, says David Dyson COMMENT - David Dyson,\u0026nbspFirearms expertFor many centuries crossbows have been used in warfare. There was no great skill or training required to use one, unlike the long bow, and the capability of some of the most powerful medieval weapons to penetrate armour and kill at ranges of up to 200 yards made them a formidable weapon.As firearms became more efficient the use of crossbows in battle declined from the 16th century onwards.But crossbows are still used for hunting.Although the use of crossbows for hunting is banned in the UK, there is a significant body of hunters, particularly in the US and Canada who use them for shooting deer and even bears - which gives an idea of how powerful they are.The Crossbows Act 1987 makes it illegal for under-18s to buy a crossbow in the UK, but there are no other checks on buyers.Despite being lethal weapons, crossbows are not subject to licensing as they are not barrelled.However, they may be far more powerful than an air rifle of a type that would require a firearms certificate.The ease with which crossbows can be bought means anyone can possess a weapon capable of killing at considerable distance.Murders have been committed with crossbows in various parts of the world, including the UK, and their silent nature makes them ideal for poachers hunting deer.Because crossbows were superseded in warfare by firearms, guns have been viewed as the greater threat to the public, and legislation controlling firearms was properly introduced in the UK almost 100 years ago.The many changes to firearms law have tended to be reactive and it may well be that it is only the increased criminal use of crossbows that will act as a similar catalyst."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/secondary/Jamie-s-Italian-1341511.jpg","title":"jamie oliver jamie s italian celebrity chef healthy eating campaigner","story":"The father-of-five, who spearheads a drive to ban junk food ads, serves up burgers at his high street chain containing the entire daily 70g fat limit recommended by doctors.A side dish of sweet potato fries at Jamie\u0026rsquos Italian would contains 34g of fat, while a creamy burrata starter contains 41g and a chocolate praline dessert another 43g.Jamie, 42, has launched a campaign urging MPs to take action against junk foods ads \u0026ldquobombarding kids.Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver spearheads a campaign to ban junk food adsSome menu items at Jamie\u0027s Italian are full of fat and sugarHis #AdEnough campaign has seen stars including Amanda Holden, Claudia Schiffer and Richard Branson sharing pictures of themselves covering their eyes on social media.Celebrities including Fearne Cotton, Paloma Faith and the cast of Cold Feet say the only ad-blocker that children currently have is covering their eyes.And outlining his campaign on his blog, Jamie said: \u0026ldquoKids are bombarded, day-in, day-out, with adverts for food and drink products that are high in unhealthy fats, sugar and salt.Jamie Oliver is a veteran healthy eating campaigner\u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquore online, on TV, on the streets and all over public transport.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time we put child health first.

Iraq election 2018 results LIVE: Updates in Iraqi parliament electionRETUERSNationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr is on course to win Iraq\u0027s parliamentary election Ali Akbar Velayati - Top adviser to the Islamic Republic\u0027s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali KhameneiSadr\u0027s apparent victory does not mean his bloc could necessarily form the next government as whoever wins the most seats must negotiate a coalition government, expected to be formed within 90 days of the official results.Security and commission sources had earlier said Abadi was leading the election, which was held on Saturday and is the first since the defeat of Islamic State in the country.Turnout was 44.52 per cent with 92 per cent of votes counted, the Independent High Electoral Commission said - that was significantly lower than in previous elections. Full results are due to be officially announced later today.Sadr and Amiri both came in first in four of the 10 provinces where votes were counted, but the cleric\u0027s bloc won significantly more votes in the capital, Baghdad, which has the highest number of seats.REUTERSCleric Moqtada al-Sadr has been an enemy of the United States and IranThe commission did not announce how many seats each bloc had gained and said it would do so after announcing the results from the remaining provinces.A document provided to Reuters by a candidate in Baghdad that was also circulating among journalists and analysts showed results from all 18 provinces.Reuters could not independently verify the document\u0027s authenticity but the results in it for the 10 provinces announced by the electoral commission matched those of the commission.Reuters calculations based on the document showed Sadr had won the nationwide popular vote with more than 1.3 million votes and gained 54 of parliament\u0026rsquos 329 seats. He was followed by Amiri with more than 1.2 million votes, translating into 47 seats, and Abadi with more than 1 million votes and 42 seats.Sadr will not become prime minister as he did not run in the election but his apparent victory puts him in a position to pick someone for the job. Winning the largest number of seats does not automatically guarantee that, however. The other winning blocs would have to agree on the nomination.In a 2010 election, Vice President Ayad Allawi\u0027s group won the largest number of seats, albeit with a narrow margin, but he was blocked from becoming prime minister for which he blamed Tehran.The same fate could befall Sadr. Iran has publicly stated it would not allow his bloc to govern.We will not allow liberals and communists to govern in Iraq, Ali Akbar Velayati, top adviser to the Islamic Republic\u0027s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in February.Moqtada al-Sadr apparent victory does not mean his bloc could necessarily form the next governmentHis statement, which sparked criticism by Iraqi figures, was referring to the electoral alliance between Sadr, the Iraqi Communist Party and other secular groups who joined protests organised by Sadr in 2016 to press the government to see through a move to stem endemic corruption.Sadr has a zealous following among the young, poor and dispossessed but had been sidelined by influential Iranian-backed figures.During the election campaign, frustrated Iraqis of all shades complained about their political elite\u0027s systematic patronage, bad governance and corruption, saying they didn\u0027t receive any benefits of their country\u0027s oil wealth.Iraq has been ranked among the world\u0027s most corrupt countries, with high unemployment, rife poverty, weak public institutions and bad services despite high oil revenues for many years. Endemic corruption has eaten at the government\u0027s financial resources.Sadr derives much of his authority from his family. Sadr\u0027s father, highly respected Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, was murdered in 1999 for defying Saddam Hussein. His father\u0027s cousin, Mohammed Baqir, was killed by Saddam in 1980.Celebrations erupted on the streets of Baghdad after the commission\u0027s announcement, with thousands of Sadr\u0027s supporters singing, chanting, dancing and setting off fireworks while carrying his picture and waving Iraqi flags.For the first time I can say congratulations to the leader and congratulations to the Iraqi people, congratulations on winning first place in Baghdad, and God willing we will be the first in Iraq, said Abbas Allawi, a candidate on the Sadr-backed Sairoon list.Moqtada al-Sadr has a zealous following among the young, poor and dispossessedMany of his supporters chanted Iran out.Whoever wins the election will have to contend with the fallout from President Donald Trump\u0027s decision to quit Iran\u0027s nuclear deal, a move Iraqis fear could turn their country into a theatre of conflict between Washington and Tehran.Abadi, a British-educated engineer who came to power four years ago after Islamic State seized a third of Iraq\u0027s territory, received U.S. military support for Iraq\u0027s army to defeat the Sunni Muslim militant group even as he gave free rein to Iran to back Shi\u0027ite militias fighting on the same side.He was viewed as a frontrunner before the election. His rivals were seen as Maliki and Amiri, both closer than Abadi to Iran, which has wide sway in Iraq as the primary Shi\u0027ite power in the region.If parliament chooses to grant him a second term, Abadi will remain under pressure to maintain that balancing act amid tensions between Washington and Tehran over the nuclear accord.Abadi was seen by some Iraqis as lacking charisma and as ineffective. He had no powerful political machine of his own when he took office.Iraq is ranked among the world\u0027s most corrupt countriesBut the defeat of Islamic State and Abadi\u0027s campaign to eradicate Iraq\u0027s rampant corruption improved his standing.Amiri\u0027s Badr organisation played a key role in the battle against Islamic State. But some Iraqis resent his close ties to Tehran. The dissident-turned-militia leader spent more than two decades fighting Saddam from exile in Iran.The results unexpectedly showed former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who was touted as a serious challenger to Abadi, lagging behind.Sadr portrays himself as an Iraqi nationalist and last year met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia who is staunchly opposed to Iran."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000278857477.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"national living wage uk 2018 increase minimum wage 16 18 25","story":"But the amount is still below the Real Living Wage, a voluntary scheme to which thousands of employers including retailers, local authorities and charities have got involved.The National Living Wage is the amount of money all employees aged over 25 are legally entitled to.It used to be known as the National Minimum Wage, but it was re-branded in 2016.The National Living Wage increased from £7.50 to £7.83 for those aged 25 and over.The 33 pence-an-hour rise was introduced on Sunday April 1, 2018.The compulsory National Living Wage was introduced in 2016.The first National Minimum Wage was set in 1998 by the Labour government.Mr Hammond is aiming to get the wage to £9 by 2020.The National Minimum Wage is the amount which workers aged under 25, but of school-leaving age, are entitled to.However, the amount differs depending on age and whether the worker is on an apprenticeship scheme.Workers aged 21-24 were paid £7.05 - and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We never lose hope.”Kate, 50, previously said: “I do all the present buying. I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a difficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence.”Maddie was kidnapped after being left sleeping alone with her twin siblings at their holiday apartment in the Algarve’s Praia da Luz.At the time her parents were dining with pals at a nearby resort tapas restaurant.She was discovered missing from her bed in the rented flat by her horrified mum shortly after 10pm.Detectives believe she was stolen by child traffickers, sex fiends or during a burglary gone wrong.Scotland Yard are still chasing “a final line of inquiry” and have been given extra £154,000 funding to keep their Operation Grange investigation going until the end of September.GOT a story?

Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party.

We will not stand for it.We live in an integrated and cohesive society with a proud tradition of religious tolerance and I want to see that reflected in workplaces across the country.As long as it doesnt interfere with someones work they should just be allowed to get on with the job.The Church of England welcomed the decision, adding: Christians who wish to show their faith by wearing a cross should be free to do so. Freedom of expression continues to be an important British value.Miss Eweida was sent home in 2006 for refusing to conceal her crucifix necklace, and after a long legal battle the European Court of Human Rights ruled in her favour in 2013.It found that the UK had failed to protect her fundamental right of freedom to manifest her faith in the workplace.But the same court rejected a similar legal challenge from a nurse, Shirley Chaplain, ruling a hospital could refuse permission for health and safety reasons.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account.

The evidence is so heavily weighted to involvement by one of the aircrew taking this aircraft down.“That aircraft has probably depressurised, the people died of asphyxiation, it was premeditated murder. It was highly planned. The bodies have never been found.” But despite experts’ observations, the Malaysian government, which has signed a “no cure, no fee” deal with Texas-based company Ocean Infinity to resume the hunt for the plane, remains silent on the question of Zaharie’s possible involvement.Ocean Infinity started the search on January 22 this year, following a failed £111million search for the plane.  At the time, experts said they expected to have answers within a matter of weeks.The company has 90 search days to look for the plane, which has been spread over several months. Officials said there was roughly an 85 per cent chance of finding traces of the wreckage in a new 15,000 square mile search area.The investigation is expected to end in mid-June but those on the TV show said they feared MH370 may never be found."},{"url":null,"title":"chiefs sack dad snapchat prank","story":"Alun Rees, from Rhondda in Wales, posted a series of clips on his Facebook page and joked that his supervisors were lazy.In his most recent video, he posed as someone applying for a job and the company boss using two different Snapchat filters.He pretended to offer someone a supervisor role and was told you havent got to do anything and you havent got to keep your eyes open all day.At the time he worked for a construction company for almost two years and was building two power stations at an EDF Energy site in Bridgwater.But the video went viral and he was ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and had his pass to the Hinkley Point C site taken away three days later.The former bulldozer operator started his most-recent video – which was viewed 100,000 times – by pretending to be a potential future employee.He was reading a job advert in a newspaper which said: “Urgent workers needed, no experience necessary.”Mr Rees, a father of twin one-year-old boys, then offered the person three jobs – including a supervisor role.He said: “You haven’t got to do anything, you haven’t got to keep your eyes open all day and there’s absolutely no learning involved whatsoever.“You get a Land Rover, lovely nice healthy wage, more than all the operators, and, best of all, you get a shiny blue helmet.”But Mr Rees told Wales Online that he was encouraged by his colleagues – and even his supervisors – to make more videos because “everyone on the site loved them”.He said: “It was a bit of fun, everyone was telling me to keep making them and egging me on because it boosted morale, even the supervisors.“I didn’t mean to upset anybody, I was just having a laugh and everybody on site loved them.“I had a friendly warning on the Wednesday and was told to take it down and I did immediately.“I agreed to go to a disciplinary meeting the next day with my union rep and they admitted it was light-hearted and gave me no indication that there would be serious action taken.“After being told not to do it again, they asked me to get the video up on my phone so they could watch and have a laugh before going back to their desks.“I left work on the Friday for the Bank Holiday weekend and just by chance I checked my emails on Saturday and there was a dismissal email.

Its like a nuclear reaction or something.The new opening was still showing signs of activity Sunday afternoon.The fissure measures about 1,000 feet in length.The US Geological Surveys Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said new fissures, ground deformation and abundant volcanic gases indicate eruptions on the eastern flank of Kilauea are likely to continue.USGS scientist Steve Brantley said: The appearance of the fissures in the past couple of days does not change the overall picture or concern.Christian and Maritza Ricks, who moved to the area from California in April, stopped on the side of the road to watch and listen to the latest eruption.Ricks said: I guess its just part of living on the island.He said he wasnt really afraid of the destruction happening around him.In a way its kind of exciting to see whats going on and be this close to it.Most of the lava outbreaks have occurred in and around the Leilani Estates neighbourhood, where molten rock has burst through the ground, destroying more than two dozen homes and resulting in evacuation orders for nearly 2,000 people.The US Geological Survey has reported nearly 20 active fissures.One that opened Saturday night was spattering, but no flow had formed.The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported the fissures opened just east of the Puna Geothermal Venture energy conversion plant, where steam and hot liquid are brought up through underground wells and the steam feeds a turbine generator to produce electricity.Plant workers last week as a precaution removed 189,265 litres of a flammable gas stored at the site.Geologists warn that Kilaueas summit could have an explosive steam eruption that would hurl huge rocks and ash miles into the sky."},{"url":null,"title":"sydney harbour bridge man caught filming woman selfie stick","story":"Named only as Angelica, the 25-year-old was exercising in her luxury waterfront apartment in Sydney, Australia, when she noticed the phone on her balcony peering up from the property below.The device belonged to Phillip Manwarring, 47, who claims he was simply checking the brickwork of the building which he shared with his neighbour, reports the Daily .Father-of-two Phillip had attached the phone to a selfie stick which he then strapped to a wooden pole using tape.Angelica was working out in sportswear when she saw the camera out of the corner of her eye on May 2.She said: “I was shocked to see this and jumped up, grabbed my shirt off the lounge and hid behind a wall where I thought the smartphone might not be able to see me while I put my shirt back on.”Lawyer Phillip insists the dispute over the brickwork has been ongoing since 2016 and relates to a botched renovation.He claims he has asked his neighbour 19 times for permission to gain access to her flat to complete the building work.Phillip says that the property is deteriorating because of the delay in fixing the problem.The 47-year-old insists the filming of the brickwork was supervised by his own engineers and builders.He says the footage “only shows the walls of the property.”Four days after the filming incident, Angelica moved to her family’s new home in the Sydney suburb of Henley only to spot Philips car parked outside.She told police: “I dont know how Manwarring would know where I live in Henley.”The lawyer claims he only drove past the family home to ask about the proposed renovations.Police have launched an investigation into the matter and both parties have moved out of the luxury apartment building in the Kirribilli area of the city."},{"url":null,"title":"southwest airlines flight third emergency landing","story":"Oxygen masks were deployed when flight 861 from Denver to Dallas suddenly lost cabin pressure at 20,000 ft on Saturday night.The 120 travellers on board the jet then had an agonising 30-minute wait before it finally landed at Dallas Love Field, CBS DFW reported.Southwest later described the landing as uneventful - which certainly doesnt mirror the thoughts of those on board.Saturday’s emergency landing is just the latest safety scare for Southwest Airlines.Last month, mum Jennifer Riordan, 43, died after she was sucked out of the window following a midair explosion on Southwest Airlines flight 1380.The Southwest Boeing 737 had just departed New Yorks LaGuardia Airport en-route to Dallas when the left engine exploded and ruptured metal flew towards a window.Then another Southwest plane was forced to make an emergency landing after reports of a shattered window.Flight WN 957 from Chicago was diverted to Cleveland, Ohio just before 11 am local time - just two hours after taking off.It is believed that the shattered window was an emergency exit seat.The planes 76 passengers were calmly directed by a crew member to grab their belongings and board another flight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She lived and breathed those qualities from the second she woke in the morning till the moment her head hit the pillow. Her whole life she was dedicated to, and motivated by, the needs of others. Even in illness, she was determined to ally her sad fate to her profile and her position in Parliament, so she could fight and win for others with the same illness, but without the platform. She secured considerable extra funding for cancer care as a result. Politics to her was not some game - Cabinet on Brexit take note - but the means by which real challenges could be met, real people helped. Tessa saw the good in everyone. But she also saw the problems in their lives and wanted to help solve them. Her background before politics was in social work and mental health. She retained the passion required for those challenges in everything she did.  How my children react to our friends has always been important to me. Our three children adored Tessa. She was an enormous part of their lives, never forgot birthdays, loved meeting their friends, celebrating their successes. I remember one Halloween when she had promised to go trick or treating with our daughter Grace. There was a huge drama at Westminster and Tessa was at the heart of it. Grace was sure she would not turn up. She did. Grace was in bits on Saturday night when we got the news . But through the tears she said something that got to the heart of Tessa’s personality, and a quality that made her such an effective politician. She said she had never met anyone else with the quality Tessa had, to make whoever she was talking to feel like there was nowhere else they wanted to be at that time. Her smile and her positivity were infectious. It is said of some people that they’re ‘too nice for politics.’ Nobody ever said that of Tessa. But she was tough too, always calm and polite but very forceful when she needed to be. That mix of charm and compassion, steel and resilience, is what delivered one of the greatest events of recent times, London 2012 Tessa drove that whole process. She persuaded a Prime Minister unsure he needed another huge challenge in his intray, a reluctant Chancellor worried about costs, a less than enthusiastic Cabinet and government machine. That battle won, she set to leading the fight to beat Paris, then making the Games a success. As Seb Coe said yesterday, nobody deserves more credit than Tessa for London 2012.

The Brextremists who once pretended there was the prospect of the greatest trade deal ever no longer kid perhaps even themselves. Tantrum Trump champions not America but Donald First, as we carry on seeing the fallout from a reality TV star hijacking the US Presidency.

With his unilateral withdrawal from the successful Iran no-nukes deal signed by Britain, Grim Reaper Trump has demonstrated that he does not give a damn. His decision to risk war with Iran follows a pattern of bad behaviour: threatening punishing import taxes pouring acid rain on a climate change treaty ignoring allies to shift the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.  It is compelling evidence of why Britain is stronger in the European Union than as an isolated target of this loose cannon in America. As the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan candidly conceded, Brexit is not going as well as he and his fellow quitters had expected. Jobs are at stake and slippery Michael Gove is just the latest Cabinet Minister to humiliate Theresa May as she struggles to negotiate with the Conservative Party let alone with the rest of Europe. Boris Johnson, Trump’s Mini-me in Britain, daily broadcasts the confusion of the Brextremists. If you listen or read the statements and speeches by Emily Thornberry, Johnson’s opposite number on the Labour benches, you will see how she exposes shallow Johnson’s terrifying lack of depth.

Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “It looks like turning warmer from the weekend of the royal wedding onwards. “Warm air is expected to come up from the near continent, with warmer-than-average conditions likely for the UK as a whole. “Saturday looks pleasant for the wedding, with dry and bright conditions most likely.” A Met Office forecaster said: “A dry and warm theme is likely to continue into the weekend for much of England and Wales, and through the following week the South and East, though some rain is possible. “The last few days of May could well stay dry and relatively warm in the South and East, with the potential for some very warm spells.”  MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said: “Air will probably start coming to the UK from France, with 24C shown on forecast models by May 21 as temperatures increase. “The weather for the royal wedding looks good for people enjoying time outdoors.” American Ms Markle will be relieved after her reported worries about Britain’s weather disrupting her wedding.  The couple will travel in an open-topped carriage if dry, but a covered carriage if wet. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “It looks like sunblock not brollies for Harry and Meghan’s big day. “And with a warm-up following the wedding, the royal couple could do well going on honeymoon near home.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"builder sacked after prank snapchat","story":"NewsBuilder sacked after prank Snapchat video goes viral - and he says his bosses have no sense of humourAlun Rees worked for construction company HPC for nearly two years, but his bosses did not see the funny side of his prank video\u0026nbspShareByBronte HowardAnna Slater22:43, 13 MAY 2018NewsAlun Rees was sacked for a humorous Snapchat video in which he took the mickey out of work supervisors (Image: Meida Wales)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A builder lost his job after a prank Snapchat video mocking supervisors went viral.  Alun Rees worked for construction company HPC for nearly two years and was working at an EDF Energy site in Bridgewater, south Wales, building two power stations.  But after posting a series of Snapchat videos on Facebook , with the latest mocking supervisors for being lazy, Mr Rees found himself in a disciplinary hearing and was fired three days later.  Now Mr Rees is not seeing the funny side and has accused his bosses of lacking a sense of humour. “It was a bit of fun, everyone was telling me to keep making them and egging me on because it boosted morale, even the supervisors,” said the former bulldozer operator. “I didn’t mean to upset anybody, I was just having a laugh and everybody on site loved them.”  Mr Rees, who is a dad to one-year-old twin boys and lives in the Rhondda, uploaded four videos on social media in the past year but it wasn’t until the latest one was watched nearly 100,000 times that he was told it was against company policy.  In his latest video, Mr Rees poses as two characters by using different Snapchat filters – a woman with a high pitched voice who is applying for a job in the company and the boss, according to Wales Online .  Throughout the four-and-a-half-minute video, Mr Rees offers the woman, who doesn’t want to work hard or learn anything, three jobs - with the final being a role of the supervisor. “You haven’t got to do anything, you haven’t got to keep your eyes open all day and there’s absolutely no learning involved whatsoever,” Mr Rees says in the video. “You get a Land Rover, lovely nice healthy wage, more than all the operators, and, best of all, you get a shiny blue helmet.” Mr Rees said his colleagues and supervisors encouraged him to make more and supervisors even watched the video in the disciplinary hearing. “I had a friendly warning on the Wednesday and was told to take it down and I did immediately,” he said.

And when he went on the run, the 12-year-old’s dad Glen vowed to hunt down his paedophile brother and bring him to justice. Tanith’s outraged mum and auntie – who had discovered an explicit video of Ian McLeod-McLean assaulting her on his phone – were fiercely behind Glen, seen by family and friends as a heroic vigilante dad on a crusade for his daughter. But the only one not cheering him on was terrified Tanith. Because she was hiding a secret so horrifying she thought no-one would believe it. Her uncle AND her dad had BOTH been abusing her – with assaults starting when she was THREE.  And astonishingly, evil Glen continued to attack his confused and vulnerable daughter while playing the hero, trying to get his brother Ian extradited from Sierra Leone. Now 23, Tanith today waives her right to anonymity to tell her sickening story in the hope of inspiring other children suffering like she did to be brave and speak out about their secret hell. “I want them to know there is life after abuse,” says Tanith. “And you should have the courage to speak out because people will listen to you. Since my dad and uncle were jailed, life has got better. Before that I felt like I could trust no one. “Even after my uncle was found out, I didn’t believe he would be brought to justice. My dad had vowed to find him and bring him home and everyone thought he was protecting me – but I knew he was just as bad as his brother.”  While most people’s first memories are of birthday parties or their first day at school, Tanith can remember being three and already becoming the object of her dad’s unwanted advances. After two years of secret sexual assaults while her mum was out or in bed, the youngster was scared and confused by what was happening to her. She says: “You feel so helpless at the time. You have so many mixed feelings. “To the outside world – and to me a lot of the time – my dad was a good parent. He took me places and made sure I didn’t want for anything and I loved him. “The abuse was just a small evil part of his character – and every time he did it I felt awful, but he was my dad.”  She became so confused and indoctrinated by his depraved acts, that when her uncle began abusing her without his brother’s knowledge, Tanith was already used to being a victim. For years, the two men would take turns to attack her – while to the outside world Tanith seemed to be living the life of any ordinary schoolgirl. Her married parents lived in a nice home in Maidstone, Kent.  Glen was a successful property developer and her family were close with ex-army diving instructor Ian and his wife. Tanith says: “No one suspected a thing. My mum and my auntie would have been horrified if I had ever told them what was going on. “They always wanted me to be safe and happy. And dad and Ian were so careful in the way they carried out the abuse.” It was only when Tanith was 12 and her auntie – who we have agreed not to name – borrowed Ian’s phone in 2008 that the sick web of lies unravelled.  She says: “She was looking at his pictures and she found an explicit video he had made when he was abusing me. She couldn’t believe it. “But it was all there and there was no way anyone could deny it any more. I felt mixed emotions of relief and fear of what would happen next – but also of guilt.” When her dad heard the news his brother was also abusing his daughter, he had a heart attack. Tanith had mixed emotions. “It was really scary because he wasn’t only one of the men who had been doing this to me – he was my dad,” she says. “No one else knew what he had been doing so everyone blamed Uncle Ian for his illness.  I wanted the abuse to stop but I also wanted him to get better because he was my dad. It was very confusing for a child.”  She watched perplexed as her dad became a hero, battling back from illness to travel to Sierra Leone in a bid to bring his brother home.  Everyone around me thought he was doing the right thing but in the background the abuse was still going on,” she says. “I wanted my uncle to go to jail and my dad was trying to make that happen so I didn’t want to come forward about him too in case they both escaped justice.” Two years later in 2010, Ian was extradited after falling ill with malaria while living on the streets of Sierra Leone. Tanith gave evidence via video link at Maidstone Crown Court.  Her uncle pleaded guilty to 19 counts of sexual abuse and was jailed for 12 years. But while the rest of the family breathed a sigh of relief, Tanith hid her dark secret for another year. “I was totally torn about whether to say anything about my dad as I knew what it would do to my family,” she says.  “The abuse was happening less frequently and he had promised me it would stop altogether, so I kept my silence. “Then one day while he was on holiday in Dubai we were talking on Skype and I told him I was going to tell.” Remarkably Tanith, then 14 plucked up the courage to tell a friend and her parents about what was going on.  Her mum – who is also not being named – was then informed and Glen was arrested. Tanith says: “I remember coming home and my mum was just sitting in the house crying – she’d had no idea what had happened and she was completely broken. I felt bad for what it did to my family but I thought that finally the abuse would end and that was a huge relief.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fit active 25 year old","story":"News\"Fit and active\" 25-year-old with Stage 3 brain tumour doesn\u0027t qualify for benefits \u0027because he went travelling for two years\u0027Curt Rimmington\u0027s girlfriend Laura Sullivan is providing for both of them while he goes through treatment\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTommy Wathen09:13, 14 MAY 2018Updated11:30, 14 MAY 2018NewsCurt Rimmington, 25, is being supported by his girlfriend Laura Sullivan (Image: Essex Live)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A young man left unable to work due to a Stage 3 brain tumour cannot claim benefits because he went travelling for two years.  Fit and active Curt Rimmington was left shocked when he received the devastating diagnosis after suffering seizures. The 25-year-old, from Colchester, Essex, is being supported by his girlfriend, Laura Sullivan, who is now providing for both of them while he goes through treatment.  Curt\u0027s family told Essex Live he tried to claim benefits to help with their expenses, but was stunned when he was told he didn\u0027t qualify because he was out of the country for so long.  They have launched a fundraiser to help the young couple through the difficult time.  Curt\u0027s younger brother Jack, 19, said: Curt is not entitled to benefits because he was travelling outside of the country for two years even though he had paid national insurance from the age of 16 until he went travelling. He is living with his partner Laura and she is having to provide for both of them and Curt does not receive any support or benefits. The donations that we receive will go towards their general living costs and also additional treatment. Curt had worked in the UK as a vehicle technician from an apprenticeship at the age of 16 until he left the country to travel the world in 2014.  While abroad he worked with bricklayers and in demolition in Sydney, Australia, along with time working on a banana farm in Queensland. Two years later, he returned to Colchester and began working in construction and fencing. Then, in September 2017, he suffered a seizure in his sleep that would later lead towards the discovery of a brain tumour during an MRI scan in hospital. He was initially told that that the tumour was not believed to be cancerous, although several seizures followed in the months after the operation and Curt was then required to undergo open brain surgery in February of this year. Doctors attempted to remove as much of the tumour as possible, but found that the tumour was intertwined with parts of the brain and it limited how much of the tumour could be removed. Tests were done on the samples taken from the brain and it was found to be stage three cancer.

Hannah Gilbert said she suddenly transformed into a different person for three weeks every month from the age of 14. She said her brother and sister were scared of her and her behaviour became so bad when she got to 16 that her exasperated family kicked her out. When she moved back a year later, she had an explosive row with her dad and the day after he had a heart and died - something she blamed herself for for years. But Hannah has only been given an official diagnosis for her condition in recent years. Few people know about PMDD - pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder but it affects one in 20 women in Britain. Only one in 50 are diagnosed with the condition despite its ability to ruin lives.  During her heartbreaking battle with the disorder she said she tried to take her life on more than one occasion and she left her husband Sam \u0027feeling like he\u0027s walking on eggshells\u0027. Writing in the Bristol Post , Hannah explained how PMDD has affected her life in her own words...   Writing this, telling my story, has to be one of the hardest things. I want you to know that whatever happens you are not alone, and just because I’m writing this, it doesn’t mean you will have it, but there maybe a possibility, and that’s ok. Pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder is an illness that effects one in 20 women in the UK. Thirty per cent of women in the world have it, 15 per cent of women who suffer, end up self-harming or committing suicide and sadly only two per cent of women get diagnosed. It’s not just about my periods. It is so much more - I wish it was PMS and \u0027Aunt Flow\u0027, out-staying her welcome! It turns out, PMDD sufferers have an anomaly in their gene activity that triggers more sensitivity to estrogen and progesterone, which leads to more intense pre-menstrual symptoms. My symptoms are so severe it stops me having a normal life. There is no worse feeling than living a life, feeling normal, then one day when your body changes and you first start your journey into womanhood, you get robbed. You\u0027re robbed of an experience because you are suddenly hit with so many emotions: Intense anger for no reason, depression and extreme anxiety, insomnia and vivid dreams. You feel that you have stepped into the pages of Jekyll and Hyde, that you are now living this life. You become two people: The normal you that pops up for only one week of a month, this person then hides away in the shadows of the other one - that hormonal b***h that you wish would go away, the one you can’t control and don’t understand why all this has happened. I want you to know that I understand, I will be there and I will support you. I spent most of my periods in the school nurse\u0027s office, crying in pain from the severe cramps and feeling like a freak. I used to pour my heart out to my mum, saying I hated who I was becoming.  I used to pray to God to end my suffering because the pain was unbearable. My brother and sister were afraid of me, they never knew when I would lose my temper and have an episode. I loathed who I was for three weeks of the month. I went to the doctor\u0027s crying for help and my mum came along for support. I was told it was just behavioural and that I would grow out of it. My schooling became effected, but my mum and dad never gave up: They made sure I had tutors to help me, so I could have an education. When I was 16, I was thrown out of my home, I was too dangerous and my moods to unpredictable. Homeless, I moved in with friends. I sofa surfed until a year later, I moved back home. Then on March 16, 2004, I had a huge episode and had a massive argument with my dad. He died the next day from a heart attack and I never got to say sorry, I blamed myself for many years for his death. I was left feeling so dark in myself and that there was something wrong with me and had no hope. I made a few attempts on my life, I self-harmed and I couldn’t stand the weight I would pile on, so I developed an eating disorder. My family and my friends helped me through a lot of this over the years. I never truly spoke about what was going on. How could I say, \u0027for one week I’m normal and then I feel for three weeks that I really can’t function and have no control\u0027? I’m at my worst a week before and after my period. I just sounded crazy and like I was picking and choosing when I was going to be unwell. For years I went backwards and forwards to my doctor, I was given all diagnoses, no medication was effective and I gave up hope with medical professionals. But she said she felt a huge change when she met her husband Sam. We have been on and off for many years. I’m very lucky as most women I meet who have PMDD have failed relationships. He is very patient, but we do have our problems - our relationship has been pushed a lot because of me. He has always known it wasn’t me, but felt that there is two people in our relationship: He loves me but hates the other one. He has told me he struggles and feels that he is always walking on egg-shells, afraid that whatever he says can trigger me. Over the years, I found ways of coping, throwing myself into work and my hobbies. I loved crafting and needed a creative outlet.  It’s horrible to feel that the people closest to you are the ones that are the worst affected. This was most tested when I had my first child Austin. For so many years I put off having children, mainly fear of birth and fear of me. I was once told labour is like your worst period pain, times that by ten. If my pains were anything to go by, no thank you. Sam also spoke to me about feeling scared of what I might have been like pregnant. The craziest thing happened though when I was pregnant. For the first time in 15 years, I felt normal throughout my pregnancy and for the first six months after having my son. Sam told everyone we meet: \u0027she hasn’t been crazy, she has been so normal!\u0027 It all stopped when I stopped breast-feeding and my periods came back. Trouble really came knocking. My periods didn’t come back like before I had Austin. No, they came back like when I was 14. The depression, feeling so hopeless and manic was scary. Worse, when you are a first time mum and you want to protect your child, but how do you protect them from you? Especially when you are their mum? There is no baby books that can explain me, my baby and my hormones. There was no help. The doctors tried labelling me with postnatal depression. The health visitor was advising me I was depressed. I wanted to pull my hair out and scream. The love I had for my son, I knew there was no way I was depressed, I had so much love for Austin and the connection I had. It broke me to think otherwise. I did question myself and I began to crumble very rapidly. Not being listened to, or people not having the answers because of lack of awareness, is the most detrimental thing when you have PMDD. On one of my darkest days, I found an article about PMDD. It was me, it was how I felt. The only people who listened to me, was Sam, my mum and an extremely supportive manager at work. Through their support I went about getting help. I went back to my doctors, but they dismissed what I was saying and said it was mental health and I was depressed. In the end I paid privately. I saw a wonderful consultant - she knew instantly that it was PMDD and got me on Evorel patches, twice a week. She suggested that I tried the chemical coil, and changed my diet, no more carbs and sugar.

We never lose hope.” Maddie\u0027s pink bedroom has become a shrine and has remained untouched for 11 years. Mum Kate, an ex-GP, still buys presents for her daughter every year in the hopes that one day she will come home to open them. She buys age-appropriate presents and says a lot of thought goes into her gifts.  She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a difficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence”. Kate, who is now a part-time medical worker, still spends precious moments each day in Maddie’s bedroom which she reveals has “shocking pink walls and stars on the ceiling” and where her dolls and teddies are on display. Maddie’s birthday falls just nine days after her parents joined an informal prayer gathering in their home village of Rothley, Leicestershire, to mark yet another painful anniversary of her disappearance. During the outdoor service Kate read a poem called The Contradiction to remember Maddie with haunting words: “I trace your steps, I map your face. You’re all I know and so unknown.

The 22-year-old top model will reportedly not be in attendance on Saturday when Harry ties the knot with Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle.  Lady Amelia is the grandaughter of the Queen\u0027s cousin Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, making her 37th in line to the throne. She is Prince William and Harry\u0027s second cousin, and the Queen\u0027s first cousin, twice removed.   But the Edinburgh student and her older sister Marina, 25, have not been invited to the royal wedding on Saturday, according to The Sun .  The newspaper quotes a friend as saying: They were a little surprised not to be invited as they were looking forward to going. Perhaps Harry just wanted to keep the family invited to a small number or maybe he didn’t want anyone upstaging the bride.

A community gardens project, a bread-baking initiative to help older people living in care homes and sheltered housing, and a children’s drama group are among those who will benefit this year. Up to \u0026pound3million has been awarded to 57 causes across the UK, making a massive impact on each deserving cause.It follows months of planning for the campaign, which led to a 2 week voting window to decide which which groups and organisations would finally be declared winners out of a shortlist of 95 projects across all 19 regions  In each region, the three projects with the most public votes received grants of up to \u0026pound50,000 to help them continue their work to bring people together, build stronger communities and improve the lives of thousands of people across the country. So to show just how much you are helping incredible community groups make a difference with National Lottery funding, here’s a look at just some of this year’s The People’s Projects winners.... The Trinity Project - Global Gardens Project After winning National Lottery funding of almost \u0026pound50,000 through The People’s Projects, The Trinity Projects, Global Gardens project can’t wait to get planning and see the venture grow. The group promotes intercultural communication at its “football pitch-sized” allotment through gardening, cooking and eating – bringing together refugees, asylum seekers and the wider community. The National Lottery funding will help the group to expand. Co-founder Poppy Nicol says: “It will help us to create a compost toilet, develop an on-site kitchen where we can cook with the food we grow, and appoint an outreach co-ordinator to go to other centres for asylum seekers and refugees to raise awareness of what we do and get more people involved. “It’s really exciting. When we first discovered we had been successful I just thought wow. Now we’re ready to get planning and move forward with what we want to do – we can hold out the hand of friendship, growing and sharing food to bring people together.” Depden Farm - Minds To Mend  A FARM-based project in Suffolk, supporting adults with learning difficulties, acquired brain injuries and mental health problems, is celebrating its National Lottery funding win. The Minds to Mend venture at Depden Care Farm, just outside Bury St Edmunds, will receive \u0026pound49,790 from The People’s Projects to fund a new weekly programme for those recovering from mental health problems and create a brand-new workshop.  Director Tim Freathy, who has headed the charity on his six-acre smallholding for over three years, explains: “They spend time on the farm, tending to the animals and growing crops which we sell, and they take part in team projects like fence building and creating animal enclosures. “National Lottery funding will pay for staff to allow us to open another day a week and help build a new fully accessible workshop to broaden the range of skills DCF offers everyone. “Winning this money will make a massive difference.” Priority Youth Project - Moving Forward "},{"url":null,"title":"party looks over club 18","story":"NewsParty looks over for Club 18-30 holidays after 50 years as millennials opt for Instagram-friendly tripsAt its peak, Club 18-30 catered for 100,000 revellers a year at destinations including Malia, Ayia Napa and Magaluf - and spawned the notorious TV series Club Reps\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy-Clare Martin21:51, 13 MAY 2018Updated08:59, 14 MAY 2018NewsThomas Cook could be ending their iconic \u0027sun, sex and party\u0027 brand Club 18-30\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThomas Cook could end its iconic “sun, sex and party” Club 18-30 holidays.

At its peak, Club 18-30 catered for 100,000 revellers a year at destinations including Malia, Ayia Napa and Magaluf.

Thomas Cook said: “We remain committed to Club 18-30 for summer 2018. “However, we are exploring options for the future of the brand, which could include the possibility of a sale.” The firm plans to focus on its own-brand hotels with a more Insta-friendly business model, including big-name DJs and upmarket cocktails.

Chefs and their assistants in the Windsor Castle kitchens will start washing and peeling vegetables in the next few days to make sure everything is perfect for the bride and groom. They are due to tie the knot in Windsor on Saturday, and hundreds have been speculating about what the royal couple might feed their 600 guests. Led by the Queen’s chef Mark Flanagan, the team have sourced fresh ingredients from the Home Counties and lands associated with the Queen like Windsor. Mr Flanagan said: The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us. “All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that\u0027s been a point of focus for us.  We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that. (For) all their decisions, we purely made suggestions and the couple... they\u0027ve tasted everything, they\u0027ve been involved in every detail... “We are using produce off Her Majesty\u0027s estates and that features very much. The sweet and savoury canapes are made to be consumed in two bites, while the bowl dishes can be eaten standing up.  Produce like asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season. The wedding dinner is being staged at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales, with different caterers responsible for that event for 200 guests. The food is likely to be washed down with champagne and wine from the extensive royal cellars and soft drinks. The head chef would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce like asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season - providing a wealth of options for the culinary expert who has worked for some of the world\u0027s best chefs, like Michel and Albert Roux and Raymond Blanc. In a bid to keep as many ingredients as possible British and local, Mr Flanagan\u0027s team have sourced them from the Home Counties and lands associated with the Queen like Windsor.

Jim Ratcliffe, 65, chief executive of Ineos, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of \u0026pound21.05 billion, leapfrogging his way from 18th place year.  Mr Ratcliffe, whose firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking, emerged in pole position after additional details led to a substantial revaluation of his assets. The Sunday Times has previously described him as publicity shy.  Ineos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of \u0026pound7 billion each. At second place were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth \u0026pound20.64 billion.  Their fortune jumped by \u0026pound4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year. British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with \u0026pound15.26 billion to his name.  The 60-year-old was knighted this year for services to philanthropy - recent donations include \u0026pound50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and \u0026pound5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University. This year is the 30th anniversary of the Rich List, with the top 20 now worth a combined \u0026pound218.6 billion - increasing their cumulative wealth by \u0026pound33. 5 billion in the last year. Of the 1,000 people on the list, 145 are billionaires. There are now 141 women on the list, with Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken of the brewing dynasty ranked highest at number six.  She and her financier husband Michel de Carvalho - vice chairman of Citigroup - increased their wealth by almost 20% over the past year to \u0026pound11.1 billion. Elsewhere, Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green\u0027s fortune took a tumble - his reputation was dragged through the mud following the collapse of BHS after he sold it to a man twice declared bankrupt for just \u0026pound1.  It later emerged that the department store\u0027s two pension schemes had a combined shortfall of \u0026pound571 million, risking the future of their 19,000 members and prompting MPs to call Sir Philip to give evidence in front of a parliamentary select committee. Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute \u0026pound363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by \u0026pound787 million to \u0026pound2 billion. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver exited the list completely following a rocky year for his eponymous restaurant empire - it is still undergoing restructuring after racking up debts of more than \u0026pound70 million.  In January the chain announced 12 of its 37 branches were to close. Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing \u0026pound1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said. The couple are now 11th on the list.  Aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor is still the UK\u0027s youngest billionaire at the age of 27 having inherited his fortune and his title - 7th duke of Westminster - following the death of his father two years ago. His property empire includes 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as properties in Oxford, Cheshire, Scotland and Spain. His wealth grew by \u0026pound444 million in the last year to \u0026pound9.96 billion.

However, the rapid response nurse found herself unable to go anywhere last Friday after her car was clamped in the hospital car park.

My car was parked in an area where I am allowed to park, but PEA clamped it preventing me from going to see unwell patients. I rang them to come and take if off and they refused until the money was paid. My permit had fallen off when I was driving so it wasn’t visible, but they could have checked the reg with the office,” she added. “The car sits there every day with a ticket on it.  But the 31-year-old said she is not the only hospital worker suffering parking woes at the site. Before her car was clamped last Friday, Sarah said she had already been issued two parking tickets adding, half the hospital has. No one else has been clamped but loads have had tickets, she continued. There’s girls in my office who have to park in other places and their cars are getting damaged. A nurse parked her car and when she went back someone had put dog dirt on the door handles. It’s really bad. Sarah said she would like to see something done about the parking problems at the hospital. And that she would like to have her \u0026pound60 repaid. She added: It says on the sign that it’s \u0026pound40 and I had to pay \u0026pound60, which left me with no money. I rang them and they just didn’t want to know.

And now, a secret shopper has found out just how much cheaper Aldi is than its supermarket rivals - from Asda and Tesco to Waitrose. The discount store swept the board in the High Street supermarket price survey this week, based on a trolley of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items. Its shopping basket was more than \u0026pound4 cheaper than its nearest rival in the survey - Asda - according to a report published yesterday. The price difference highlights a reason behind the proposed merger between Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s, which was announced last month.  The stores have come under growing pressure from many Brits switching to discounters like Aldi and Lidl to save money on their weekly shop. Trade magazine The Grocer carries out a weekly mystery shopping basket survey checking the prices of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items at the five major supermarket chains - but this week added Aldi as a guest retailer. It found that while Aldi shoppers paid \u0026pound33.14 for their basket of goods, customers at nearest rival Asda paid \u0026pound4.41 more, at \u0026pound37.55. Sainsbury\u0027s was ranked next at \u0026pound39.51 - which was \u0026pound6.37 more expensive than Aldi - followed by Tesco, Morrisons and Waitrose.  The Grocer said: Guest retailer Aldi claimed a convincing win over its traditional supermarket rivals this week - and in doing so illustrated one of the key reasons why Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s feel the need to merge. Aldi\u0027s \u0026pound33.14 total was \u0026pound4.41 cheaper than Asda, helped by offering the lowest price for 27 of the 33 items on our list. Twenty three of these were exclusively cheaper than any of its rivals. This makes Asda 13.3 per cent more expensive and while the gap has closed from 16.5 per cent in January, drastic measures appear to be needed if Asda is to genuinely close the price gap to the discounters.  It added: Hence the Sainsbury\u0027s merger - should a post-deal Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s live up to their promise to cut many everyday prices by 10 per cent, Asda in particular would start to look a lot more competitive. Sainsbury\u0027s, which last week also invested \u0026pound35 million in reducing the price of selected meat and fish products, actually managed to grab third spot this week. Although at \u0026pound39.51 it was \u0026pound6.37 and 19.2 per cent more expensive than Aldi. Tesco was 21.5 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound40.70, a difference of \u0026pound7.56. As our shopping list was heavily weighted towards own label, Tesco\u0027s Brand Guarantee scheme had little impact on the final standings. Our shopper had 45p taken off her bill at the checkout which still left it \u0026pound7.11 more expensive than Aldi.  Morrisons was over 25 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound41.68. In the case of sixth-placed Waitrose the difference was even greater - the \u0026pound14.86 difference on its \u0026pound48 basket makes it 44.8 per cent more expensive. Waitrose also had just two products on deal. This compared with Asda\u0027s nine, Aldi\u0027s eight, Morrisons\u0027 six and four each at Sainsbury\u0027s and Tesco.

A 60 Minutes investigation by Nine News in Australia that aired tonight features a panel of aviation experts working to determine what brought the plane down. Since March 2014 the world has questioned how a Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished into thin air en route from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most of the wreckage has never been found but now but now experts say they finally have the answers. Larry Vance, former senior investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told the Australian current affairs programme he was confident he knows what happened to the aircraft.  “I think the general public can take comfort in the fact that there is a growing consensus on the plane’s final moments,” he said. The panel believe that the man in the cockpit, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was responsible. They all agree the pilot “was killing himself” and took the plane to the most remote spot he could so it would “disappear”.  Boeing 777 pilot and instructor Simon Hardy said Captain Zaharie avoided detection of the plane by either Malaysian or Thai military radar by flying along the border, crossing in and out of each nation\u0027s airspace. Mr Hard told the programme: “As the aircraft went across Thailand and Malaysia, it runs down the border, which is wiggling underneath, meaning it\u0027s going in and out of those two countries, which is where their jurisdictions are.  “So both of the controllers aren\u0027t bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it\u0027s, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s gone. It\u0027s not in our space anymore\u0027. “If you were commissioning me to do this operation and try and make a 777 disappear, I would do exactly the same thing. “As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s very accurate flying because think it did the job and we know, as a fact, that the military did not come and intercept the aircraft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture two brit hostages","story":"NewsFirst picture of two Brit hostages kidnapped in Congo as they speak of their relief at being freedBethan Davies and Robert Jesty had been held by armed bandits since Friday after an ambush, during which a ranger was killed\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDavid BurkeRachel Bishop21:39, 13 MAY 2018Updated21:47, 13 MAY 2018NewsBethan Davies and Robert Jesty spent two days in captivity before being freed\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe two British people taken hostage in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been identified after they were freed today. Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty had been held by armed bandits since Friday after an ambush, during which a ranger was killed. A statement released on behalf of the pair said: “We are very relieved that there has been a positive outcome to the kidnapping and are very grateful for the excellent support we have received.  We do not plan to comment further.” The Foreign Office announced earlier today that the pair were freed today, although circumstances around their release have not been revealed. They were kidnapped in the Virunga National Park, which borders Rwanda, in an attack which claimed the life of Rachel Makissa Baraka. Their driver, who has also been freed, was injured during the attack in the famous gorilla park - but his condition is not yet known.  It had earlier been reported that elite SAS soldiers were dispatched to the Democratic Republic of Congo to help efforts to free the hostages. The Britons and the Congolese driver are all receiving support and medical attention, officials in DRC confirmed. In a statement Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: “I am delighted to announce that two British nationals who were held hostage in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been released. I pay tribute to the DRC authorities and the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation for their tireless help during this terrible case.    My thoughts are now with the family of Virunga Park ranger Rachel Makissa Baraka who was killed during the kidnapping, and with the injured driver and the released British nationals as they recover from this traumatic incident.” Cosma Wilungula, director general of The Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, said: “We would like to thank our brave team for ensuring the swift resolution of this incident, and the safe return of the two British nationals.” Park Director Emmanuel de Merode said: “We are deeply saddened by the death of Virunga National Park Ranger Baraka, whose life was tragically cut short whilst protecting the passengers and driver. We wish to extend our deepest condolences to her family and our sincerest gratitude for her bravery and service to Congo. We would like to thank the UK government for their support with this issue.”    The kidnappers had reportedly demanded \u0026pound150,000 in ransom for the pair\u0027s release. The circumstances around their release have yet to be clarified. The British ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, John Murton, said: The UK would like to thank the DRC authorities and MONUSCO (The United Nations peace keeping mission) for their assistance in resolving this kidnapping. I would like in particular to praise the courage and commitment shown by the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation and the Virunga Park authorities over the past three days. My deepest condolences are with the family, friends and colleagues of Rachel Makisa Baraka, the Virunga ranger killed during the kidnapping.  I wish the driver injured during the incident a speedy recovery. The bravery and determination of all the staff of Virunga is vital for the conservation of animals in the park, and the protection of local communities. The 25-year-old ranger was a so-called ‘ecoguard’ providing security on a convoy travelling through the Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Friday morning. She became the first female ranger in the bloody history of the park to be murdered by bandits. Fellow park rangers confirmed that Rachel was ‘a devoted conservationist who died in the line of duty’. One added: Her only thought would have been the safety and security of visitors to the park who were on the convoy. Virunga National Park - spanning 3,011 miles - is located in DRC’s unstable North Kivu province. It faces multiple threats from rebel groups, local bandits and the self-defence MaiMai militia partly due to its hugely lucrative charcoal industry, for which the trees of the park are the principal raw material. It is also home to one of the world’s largest populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas as well as hundreds of other rare species. In April five rangers aged between 22 and 30 were killed in an attack from a group that officials believe belong to Mai Mai militia. However, the DRC as a whole has faced growing violence recently, with authorities advising Brits avoid numerous areas across the country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice The FCO advise against all travel to the provinces of Kasa\u0026iuml, Kasa\u0026iuml Central, Kasa\u0026iuml Oriental, Haut-Uele, Haut Lomami, Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema and Tanganyika, areas to the west and east of Kananga including Tshikapa and Mwene-Ditu (as shown on the map), and within 50km of the border with the Central African Republic and South Sudan. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the cities of Goma and Bukavu and to the districts of N’djili and Kimbanseke in Kinshasa. In 2017, there has been an increase in military and police stop-and-search checkpoints in parts of Kinshasa, especially after dark. Since July 2017, there have been increased reports of several towns in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC being attacked by or having come under the control of armed groups.  There are reports of serious clashes between Congolese Armed Forces and militia groups around Uvira in South Kivu Province.

The terrified trio were attacked after two dogs went on a rampage in a housing estate and halting site in north Dublin, Ireland, yesterday.  They were hospitalised with bite injuries after the incident, while blood was left smeared down a fence and splattered on a footpath. It is believed the canines were dumped at the entrance to Avila Park, off the Cappagh Road in Finglas at around 1.30pm yesterday.  Witnesses described a female driver in a black car driving up to Avila Park and letting the pair loose, Dublin Live reports.   The dogs first attacked 12-year-old Katelynn Collins, who desperately attempted to climb a metal fence to escape. Fortunately for the youngster, relative Michael Collins arrived to visit his mother and got out of his van to rescue her. “If I’d been 30 seconds later I think I’d be going to a funeral,” Michael said. “It was like something from a horror movie.” He used his phone to hit the dog and get it off traumatised Katelynn, who fell into his arms. As he put her in his van out of harm\u0027s way, one of the dogs left the estate. But the other attacked 11-year-old Dina Collins who suffered three bites to her arm as she tried to protect herself.  Dina recalled: “The big dog came after me and went for my neck, so I put my hands up in the air and he went for my arm. “When he let go of my arm he went for my leg. A man kicked the dog away and I went up to an old woman.” The youngster needed a tetanus shot and antibiotics after the attack. Her arm is now in a sling, but her mum Lisa is relieved it wasn\u0027t worse. “There were small children all around there, it could have killed one of the children,” claimed the shocked mother. Katelynn’s sister Helen, 18, also suffered a \u0027deep\u0027 bite to her leg and was treated at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown. The younger girls were treated at Temple Street Children’s University Hospital.  Police said the trio\u0027s injuries were thought to be minor. Katelynn and Helen’s sister, Megan Stokes, was with her family in Temple Street.  She claimed: “Because we are traveller people they think it’s okay to do this.” Families around the site were celebrating First Communions and feared the incident could have been worse if more children were outside. One of the dogs was cornered in a front garden and Gardai and a dog warden removed it. The second dog was still on the loose in the Finglas area yesterday evening. Locals hoped the dog was microchipped so its owners could be traced.

The Asiana plane had just started to taxi before take off when it sliced through the tail fin of the parked jet. The wing of the Asiana Airbus A330 can be seen hitting the Turkish Airlines Airbus A321 vertical fin, knocking it clean off.  No passengers are believed to have been injured in the crash but both planes were left requiring extensive repairs. The Asiana Airbus A330, which was flying to the South Korean capital of Seoul when the crash happened, is thought to have been grounded in Istanbul.

Helicopter footage shows the huge fissure bubbling bursts of rock and magma with an ear-piercing screech after opening up on the side of the 4,000ft-high volcano. Some 37 buildings have been destroyed and nearly 2,000 people ordered to evacuate since the volcano first erupted on May 3. A number of fissures have appeared over the past 10 days but this is among the biggest and stretches to around the quarter of the length of the hillside. Mark Clawson, 64, who lives uphill from the latest fissure and so far is defying an evacuation order, said: It is a near-constant roar akin to a full-throttle 747 interspersed with deafening, earth-shattering explosions that hurtle 100-pound (45-kg) lava bombs 100 feet (30 meters) into the air.  Explosions could be heard in the evacuated Leilani Estates neighborhood of about 1,500 people as steam rose from the cracks. The bulging rim of one fissure wrecked a building, leaving behind torn metal.  In areas where sulphur dioxide emissions are strong, the vegetation has turned brown and leafless trees withered. The U.S. Geological Survey has warned that fissures could erupt throughout the area, and Civil Defense officials on Sunday ordered people living on Halekamahina Road to evacuate and be on the alert for gas emissions and lava spatter.  Meanwhile, other fissures continued to billow smoke over homes on the eastern point of Big Island, the largest of the Hawaiian islands. Even so, some people such as Mr Clawson remain in their homes, confident they will be spared. We are keeping track of lava bombs. One went through the lanai (porch) roof of a neighbor\u0027s house, he said. About eight to 10 neighbors had yet to evacuate, he added.

board","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAndy Walker’s latest poser has undergone much scrutiny from myself and the DCT archives team.But, before any of that was undertaken, he had to pass the first test.That examination was to verify if this latest sortie was about sport — a standard given for this column.And, by the tiniest of margins, it just made it!Andy opened: “After the Second World War, the British public clamoured to be entertained.“Anything that would help them forget the harshness and horrors of war.“The attendances at cinemas, theatres, dance halls and football stadia were packed nightly and weekly.“The entertainment venues had notices up – ‘sold out’, ‘admission by ticket only’ and ‘book early to avoid disappointment’.“In Dundee, the public were no different from the rest of Britain as they wanted stars to appear.“Frank Sinatra obliged, and the local ice rink brought to the fore the Dundee Tigers, who took on a massive following.“Other areas around the city joined in the jamboree of entertainment and, notably, Arbroath was one.”Andy continued with a startling revelation, and one I had never heard of.He went on: “The local council arranged for movie star Johnny Weissmuller to come to Arbroath to entertain their public by diving from the top board of the Arbroath Outdoor Swimming Pool.“When it was confirmed he would appear, ‘Tarzan-mania’ swept Angus and surrounding districts.“A posse of approximately 20 from Lochee cycled down (my late brother being one).“The travelling group were mostly teenagers from the newly-built housing scheme of Dryburgh.“It was a cracking summer’s day to go cycling and the crowds were streaming into the seated area.“Many just got seated as the allotted time for Weissmuller/Tarzan to appear neared.”Backstage, however, there seemed to be a problem, as Andy continued: “Many in the audience could not hear the heated exchanges between agents, promoters, pool officials and Weissmuller’s management team.“After a while, out of the blue, a young teenage girl from Lochee — totally bored with the hullabaloo —pushed her way through the crowd, who were fast becoming uneasy at the delay.“She snarled and shouted: ‘Let me through’ and ‘oot wi the Tarzan’ and proceeded to walk to the ladder at the foot of the highest diving board.“In no time, she was at the top.“She composed herself and effortlessly executed a perfect dive into the pool.“The girl who surfaced to a rapturous applause was Mary Pilling, from Tipperary, Lochee, and who recently moved to Dryburgh.“Mary, who stood 5 ft 1 in when wearing her ‘Double Dooners’ (wellies) swayed past the arguing party with the remark: ‘Well . . . follow that Tarzan’.“Knowing he would not do so, as she knew that the argument was about him not being insured to dive from that height.“When the movie star eventually did dive, it was from the lower board.“However, the crowd did not care as they saw Tarzan dive at the Arbroath pool.“After a break for refreshments, Mary rejoined her friends to cycle back to Dryburgh.“As the posse headed westward into the sunset back towards the promised land, the County of Angus was subjected to about 1,000 attempts to copy the Jungleman’s call.“Back in Lochee, as word spread about Mary’s deed, she was the talk o’ the washie, the berry fields, at school and the tattie fields.“Anybody who claimed they could dive over the bannister at the Lochee baths were called ‘Kailpots’ and asked: ‘Do yeh ken wit Mary Pilling done?’“The summer of 1950 was definitely one to remember.”Andy also intimated that Mary has passed away, but her brother David recently celebrated his 80th birthday.Now to the subjects mentioned in my intro.This story just makes ‘sport’ as the venue was a swimming pool and the core subject was a ‘high dive’.However, our archives team can’t find any indication of this event taking place, checking Dundee and Arbroath newspapers.What they did note, when looking through files, is that Weissmuller’s reign as Tarzan came to an end around that time and that another actor, Lex Baker, took over.There is no also evidence, though, that he came to Arbroath, but maybe there was a publicity drive by the studio or something at which a look-a-like appeared.Anyway, don’t let the facts get in the way of a great story, which might still be true, as Andy concluded . . . “There are those in Lochee that, to this day, are still adamant this event took place.”So, once again, it’s over the BwB family for confirmation.

She joined the School of Life Sciences at Dundee from her previous post at the John Innes Centre in July 2007.In 2009 she became head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology. She has received numerous awards throughout her career. In 2002 she jointly received the Microbiology Society Fleming Prize with her longstanding collaborator Ben Berks for their description of the bacterial Tat pathway.She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2009, a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2015, and a Member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 2017.Her group were one of the first to describe the Tat system, an unusual pathway that bacteria use to secrete proteins into the environment. This pathway is used by bacteria to transport proteins that cause disease in humans and animals, and that can degrade antibiotics such as penicillin.More recently, she has also worked on another protein secretion system, named Type VII, in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.Her group demonstrated that S. aureus uses this system to secrete a toxin that kills neighbouring bacteria, a process which is likely to be critical to allow the bacterium to compete with other organisms when it colonises the human body.She is set to take up a new position at Newcastle University in August 2018.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af401ada4aa0-862x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people the royal visits to dundee of yesteryear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tToday’s Dundonian is packed full of great archive photographs taken during royal visits to the City of Discovery down the years.There are pictures of the Queen, Princess Diana and other members of the royal family visiting various venues around the city.Check out the people in the backgrounds too — you might spot someone you know lining up to get a glimpse of the royal visitors.

that two motorhomes and three caravans had parked at Kingsway West Retail Park.The Travellers set up camp immediately outside Toys ‘R’ Us, which closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.Three of the caravans are parked on disabled parking spaces which are still in operation and fixtures such as barbecues have been erected by the occupants.Site managers working on behalf of the retail park confirmed to the Tele that they were taking the “necessary legal actions” to move the Travellers off the site.A spokesman said: “Both the owner and management team are aware of the occupiers in situ outside the store.“They do not have permission to be on site and as such have been served notice that they must leave the land immediately.“The necessary legal actions are being taken to remove them from the retail park.”Both Dundee City Council and Police Scotland confirmed they were aware of the Travellers’ arrival at the retail park, just yards away from other stores which are continuing to operate.When the Tele approached those living on the site, a man with an Irish accent swore through a crack in his window and said: “Mind your own business.”Only one resident opened their door but closed it immediately after being shown press ID.While the Toys ‘R’ Us store is shut, the unit in which the store operated and the land outside it is owned by fund management firm ARES and operated by the property firm GVA.The site is not licensed for the purposes of camping — meaning those who set up caravans there are doing so illegally.The council operates a licensed site for Travellers just outside Dundee at Balmuir Wood, Tealing.Twenty pitches are available at Balmuir Wood for Travelling communities, each of which features electricity supplies, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you on themselves.”A council spokeswoman said the local authority was aware of and was monitoring the situation.\u0026#8216Mind your own business\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 Travellers move in to car park

mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

in Highland could be eased with a multimillion-pound injection of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to tackle the problem of affordability.The Scottish Government is increasing last year\u0027 \u0026pound28.8 million investment to \u0026pound40.1 million in 2018-19. That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Monday 14 May 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04092000/04092368.jpg","title":"Demand for tougher A82 safety measures","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCampaigners have warned that pedestrians or cyclists could die unnecessarily because there is currently only one set of traffic lights on the entire, busy stretch between the West Link and the Ness Bridge \u0026ndash at the Kenneth Street junction.Despite years of community pressure for safer crossings, a lengthy review by roads agency Transport Scotland has concluded that cosmetic change is ample.It has pinpointed several locations for more prominent road islands, road redesign and new signposts. The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road. It\u0027 a great worry. I don\u0026rsquot know how mums with small children cope with the traffic.Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoA cont-rolled crossing is the only way to improve safety. Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Monday 14 May 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like.
