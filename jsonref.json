who was made leader of the UK\u0027s testing programme in April - said the latter strategy was crucial to curbing the epidemic. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u0027We\u0027ve rapidly expanded our testing capability into a world-beating industry and anyone with symptoms can now get a test.\u0027There has been consistent improvement in testing turnaround times and these will be published in the next NHS Test and Trace figures.\u0027Downing Street has been repeatedly pressed in recent days to give an update on whether the Government was on track to hit the end of June target. However, data on the issue has not been released.The Prime Minister\u0027s Official Spokesman was yesterday unable to say whether the pledge had been met.The spokesman said: \u0027We said that was something that we wanted to achieve by the end of the month and we\u0027re talking to Department of Health and Social Care about how we can make that data available.\u0027We\u0027ve been working to turn around those test results as quickly as possible but I don\u0027t have those figures for you.\u0027The Government\u0027s failure to set out any progress which may have been made towards hitting the target has prompted concerns that the deadline has not been met. Mr Hunt has previously written to the Prime Minister seeking an update and reassurances that efforts were on track. Last week the Tory chairman of the Health Select Committee said: \u0027Test and Trace needs rapid turnaround of test results to be effective so I am concerned that I have still not had a reply to my earlier letter to the Prime Minister asking for data on 24 hour test turnaround.\u0027Today I have written again asking him to confirm that we are on track to meet his 24 hour turnaround target by the end of June.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Dr Fauci says share remdesivir world","story":"Share this articleShare this articleGilead donates Covid-19 drug remdesivir to Australia’s medical stockpile after US buys up supply | Australia news | The Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03fef6e059e7ebfa76439ec3e42676557c94ba8/0_100_2362_1416/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd6819b512af625ca690944118d0fc1d","title":"great british art quiz munnings art museum dedham","story":"Munnings Art Museum hosts today’s quiz, setting questions to explore art collections of museums closed due to coronavirusThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

I find it overwhelming. I don’t know how to cope or act when things are meant to be “good”. What do I do? Should I be happy? What is that? How many ways can I genuinely and meaningfully thank people who congratulate me? Do they understand that if I don’t reply to their kind messages, I’m not being rude – it’s just that I don’t know what to say?It’s not that I’m not grateful when things go well, it’s more that I need to talk to a therapist about them. Anyway, imagine my discomfort when I was told that my book Queenie had won debut of the year at the British Book awards. Actually, my first feeling was relief that instead of having to attend a ceremony and have my picture taken, and get up on a stage and be looked at, I could just pre-record an acceptance speech on Zoom then go back to watching music videos all day.Still, I was so nervous staring back at myself on screen that I forgot to thank my family and friends. And then, imagine my terror when I was told, on the same Zoom call, that Queenie had also been awarded book of the year. Book of the Whole Year. Wild. I asked the person who told me to repeat what they’d said, more than once.I know how these prizes are meant to work. Having been in the industry for a while, and with the help of Wikipedia, I knew that no black woman, or indeed black person, has won that prize since the awards were started in 1994. Ever. So apparently, in the last 26 years, there has been no book by a black author seen to be deserving of that prize. I’m not downplaying my novel, I’m mainly proud of it, but still, I can’t feel completely happy about how things have gone.In my second acceptance speech I ended up saying how sad it was that it had taken so long not just for a book like Queenie to be published, but to be given such attention in the industry and in the literary world. The last written words in the novel are #BlackLivesMatter, and it felt important for me to remind the overwhelmingly white publishing industry of this, especially at this time of great change and heightened awareness.I’m hopeful, though, that my win marks a change and, more importantly, longstanding and sustainable change. Because, the playing field needs to be levelled. It needed to be levelled a long time ago. So instead of celebrating myself, I’m going to celebrate the books by black authors that came before me, that deserved just as much attention. The ones that deserved to be book of the year. I’m going to celebrate the books by black authors that weren’t published prominently enough, that didn’t make it to print, and the ones that didn’t even make it on to the page for fear that they weren’t good enough. I’m hopeful that this award can show black writers who haven’t yet had the confidence to even submit their novel that they can be winners too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d810af6d057724d70012168f83da2bcbbada8c21/0_195_6001_3602/master/6001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08490d46f500fa2768c93e9a640350f3","title":"primark loses 800m amid covid 19 lockdowns","story":"Coronavirus lockdowns have cost Primark £800m, with the clothing retailer expecting profits to tumble by two-thirds this financial year.The figures underline the difficulties faced by the retail sector, with companies ranging from Harrods to Primark’s rival Arcadia among the high street retailers announcing more than 6,000 job cuts on Wednesday.However, ABF said sales had been “reassuring and encouraging” since it started reopening Primark stores.The company has no online shopping service, so had been particularly badly hit by lockdowns.

However, the prime minister was criticised for not spending more or making enough of a priority of green projects.Gopinath said countries had no option but to tackle global heating and that responding to Covid-19 presented them with an opportunity to do so.“For many countries we can see a very good argument for them to undertake public investment spending, because this is going to be a crisis where people are going to hold back spending for a while. The private sector will hold back from spending for a while, so there is a role for public investment,” she said.Gopinath was speaking alongside Laurence Boone, the chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and both economists from the influential international organisations said Britain needed to tackle rising unemployment by ramping up support for people losing their jobs.Gopinath said a temporary increase in unemployment benefits was among options ministers should consider. Boone said reviewing social protection schemes and increasing funding for training was also key to supporting workers.Investing in a green economic recovery could create as many as 1.6m new jobs in Britain as the Covid-19 crisis subsides, according to a report published on Thursday by the Institute for Public Policy Research.Calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use his summer economic update next week to prioritise the creation of new low-carbon jobs, it said three quarters of adults in a survey believed the government should spend more on fighting global heating.Setting out a plan to create jobs and tackle the climate emergency, it said 560,000 new roles could be created by increasing funding for the energy efficiency of homes. As many as 700,000 jobs could be created in social care, while 230,000 jobs could be created by investing in sustainable public transport – such as walking and cycling infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging points. As many as 46,000 jobs could also be created with the help of more funding for tree planting and peatland restoration.Luke Murphy, IPPR associate director, said: “Our report finds that clean recovery investments are good for jobs and good for the environment – and what’s more, the public agree.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e5e2bac11b9ebbe4b29c1cdfad9a8590af68c6/0_177_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d6d6c314deb35171ffb343daed594a","title":"markets us unemployment report covid vaccine recession non farm business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as investors anticipate a record jump in US employment...and fret about rising Covid-19 casesEurozone unemployment is likely to keep rising, even if economies succeed in reopening, warns Bert Colijn of ING: In the months ahead, the surprisingly stable eurozone unemployment rate is likely to continue to creep up. This is simply because the economy is unlikely to reach the level of pre-crisis output anytime soon, leading to inevitable job losses especially when short-time work schemes draw to a close. Unemployment jumped in Italy in May, but fell sharply in France, today’s data show.The government’s lockdown measures aimed at containing infections brought the economy to its knees, with most firms shuttered throughout March and April.The jobless rate plummeted in those two months as people stopped looking for work. The rise in May reflects the gradual end of the lockdown and Italians returning to the labour market.Only people actively looking for a job count towards the unemployment rate.Younger workers have also been hit hard by the jump in unemployment in Europe.In May 2020, 2.815 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, of whom 2.267 million were in the euro area. ...Compared with April 2020, youth unemployment increased by 64 000 in the EU and by 42 000 in the euro area. Unemployment across the eurozone has risen, with women bearing the brunt of Covid-19’s impact on the economy.Eurostat, which calculates the data, shows how female workers were hit by the slump:Bad news: UK business leaders are more pessimistic about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on jobs.The Bank of England’s latest survey of chief financial officers from small, medium-sized and large companies found that they expect a bigger hit to employment than a month ago.The Decision Makers’ Panel survey also found that firms only expect sales to recover gradually this year, and are slashing investment plans. As usual, there are a wide range of forecasts for how many jobs were created in the US last month:Hopes of a Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough are lifting travel stocks in London today.Neil Wilson of Markets says the latest surge in US Covid cases isn’t causing much anxiety:Investors largely are shrugging off higher cases though as Pfizer reported positive results from a vaccine trial. But we have been here before – it’s too early to get too excited – but a working vaccine is the holy grail as it would allow real normality to return to the economy. Airlines also helped by a report in the  that Britain is effectively ditching its air bridge plan. That (if confirmed) would mean UK holidaymakers could travel to 75 countries this summer without needing to quarantine afterwards.ABF told the City that Primark stores have reopened more quickly than expected, particularly in Ireland. And while it has lost several months trading in the lockdown, demand has been strong in recent days.Shoppers have been particularly keen to buy children’s clothes, leisure and night wear, along with summer products such as shorts and t-shirts. The pandemic has been hugely costly. ABF closed all its 375 Primark stores in mid-March, costing around £650m in lost sales per month. It reopened its first stores in early May in Australia, but stores in England remained closed until 15 June, while Scottish stores only reopened last week.Stock markets across Asia-Pacific have rallied today as investors anticipate a strong US jobs report later today.Shares jumped in China, Australia and South Korea, lifting markets in the region towards four-month highs.Hopes of a Covid-19 vaccine are also cheering investors. As we covered yesterday, Pfizer reported encouraging initial results from human trials of its coronavirus vaccine, developed with Germany’s BioNTech.It’s still early days, based on a small trial. But as Pfizer research Phil Dormitzer told ABC News, the preliminary results are very exciting.Our first vaccine candidate is eliciting antibody levels to neutralize the virus that is equivalent to or better than what you see in people who have had COVID-19.”“It’s been a tremendous amount of work and there’s now a lot of pride to see the results start to come forward.The potential is there to actually change a lot of people’s lives.”Investors got the message:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.There are two schools of thought around today. One holds that the latest US unemployment report will give a crucial insight into the state of America’s economic recovery. That would show that firms are getting back to work, heralding a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 recession.As Stephen Innes of AxiCorp puts it:I do not think we can overemphasize the importance of Thursday’s NFP bridging the disconnect between improving cyclical data (i.e., PMIs) and a lackluster medium-to-long-term economic prognosis as persistently negative yields would lead one to believe. A better-than-expected outcome could go some way to settling the near-term debate that the US labor market will heal relatively quickly and justify new highs in US equities.But there’s another view -- that the worrying spike in coronavirus cases across America in recent days means June’s NFP could already be dated. Overnight, 50,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday, a new record high.More than half of new U.S. cases each day are in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, forcing those states to shutter some non-essential businesses again, undermining the economic recovery in a bid to safe lives.California governor Gavin Newsom ordered bars to close and banned indoor dining in many parts of the state, saying:The bottom line is the spread of this virus continues at a rate that is particularly concerning,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, fears some parts of the US economy are going into reverse:Either way, June’s Non-Farm Payroll will probably be the biggest story in the markets today. It normally comes on a Friday, but has been brought forwards because Friday is a US holiday (for the 4th July celebrations).Potentially confusingly, we also get the latest weekly US unemployment figures today - they’re expected to show that another 1.3m people signed on for jobless support last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f89b81fe0d1f183916989d76523ca7d20734755/0_18_3363_2019/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33860b114325f26d519525df67eaed5a","title":"labours real struggle left v right young and minority voters keir starmer","story":"Keir Starmer now has control of his party. But he risks alienating the very people that Labour needs to embraceAs far as Labour is concerned, Keir Starmer is now master of all he surveys. A landslide victory among the party’s membership was accompanied by his appointment of the national executive committee’s general secretary, and with it control of the party machine. In the past two weeks, his removal of Rebecca Long-Bailey from the shadow cabinet and changes to NEC voting mechanisms have cemented the Starmer ascendancy. Commentators who spent years howling about Corbynite authoritarianism demand more: the left must not just be thrashed but humiliated in the process. A year ago, the headline above one Times commentator’s column was “Jeremy Corbyn’s intolerance makes him unfit to lead”. Two weeks ago it was “Keir Starmer should finish the purge of Corbynism”.As Starmer eyes the best ratings of an opposition leader since the mid-1990s and the party begins to shrink the polling gap, his team can seemingly afford to shrug off their internal opponents. If criticisms from within are framed as the left versus the leadership, that suits the latter’s outriders, who can dismiss them as the petulant howls of discredited losers.But in an age of political unpredictability and fluidity, complacency would be unwise: just ask Boris Johnson who, three months ago, headed the most popular government in a decade, with a net approval of +26 (it is now –9). Starmer’s emerging Achilles heel is not his demoralised internal leftwing opponents: it is younger people and minorities.When Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour deprived the Tories of a majority in 2017, the party won the highest support among the under-40s in any election, including Tony Blair’s landslide. It also repelled more pensioners than ever, and given they constitute a quarter of the electorate and are motivated to vote, Labour did not win that election. Even in the 2019 rout, Labour’s lead among the under-25s actually increased. While Corbyn had dire approval ratings in the overall population at the last election, he enjoyed net support among ethnic minority voters. There are important exceptions, of course – Jews worried about antisemitism and some British Indian voters affronted by Labour’s support for Kashmiri self-determination – but Corbyn’s long involvement with anti-racism struggles and close alliance with figures such as Diane Abbott led many minorities to conclude he was a natural ally.Defunding the police was never going to be part of Starmer’s policy package, but during a global uprising against systemic racism he could have taken a more constructive approach. He could have said he was not a spokesman for Black Lives Matter, that while he supported the police, reform was needed in a country in which most black people believe the police are institutionally racist. He could have pointed to the report put together by his own shadow home secretary, David Lammy. He could also have championed investment in youth, social and mental health services, rather than relying on the justice system to deal with society’s ills.Younger people flocked to Corbyn’s Labour in unprecedented numbers for two reasons: first, their economic and social insecurity, from the housing crisis to student debt to low-paid work second, they felt their progressive social values were under assault. They have no ingrained loyalty or sentimentality towards the party. Otherwise politically disengaged young people post in support of Black Lives Matter. If the suited former director of public prosecutions wants to pick a fight with the Black Lives Matter movement young people will judge him harshly for it.That nearly two-thirds of black and minority ethnic voters have seen Labour as their champion is unsurprising: as well as an inherently racist justice system, nearly half of black African Caribbean households languish below the poverty line, andblack, Asian and minority ethnic workers are far more likely to have insecure work and to live in overcrowded homes. These are injustices that cannot be fixed with tinkering or with half-measures: only transformative policies can be considered genuine remedies.For those who want the party to remain committed to radical change, the battle lines should not be drawn as “left versus right”, but judged on whether Labour is abandoning the under-40s and minorities. True, Labour is emphatic it retains the pledge, for instance, to scrap tuition fees, although it refuses to commit to any manifesto policies. But when none of the party’s recent economic statements mentions the climate emergency, that should be judged as betraying younger people who will suffer the worst consequences of this existential crisis. When Starmer sits on the fence on trans rights, the leadership should be taught a lesson: that for younger people, LGBTQ rights are an article of faith. From housing to jobs to education to public services, a test must be applied: does the radicalism of Labour’s policies meet the scale of injustice facing younger and minority Britons.For those within the party, from Momentum to the soft left Open Labour, a coalition should be built to hold the leadership to the policy commitments Starmer made in his election: that is, after all, his mandate. But more importantly, extra-parliamentary movements such as Black Lives Matter can communicate a message that is impossible to ignore: the support of the under-40s and minorities is not unconditional, it has to be actively sought, and if they feel the party has abandoned them, they will respond accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f0465b26bb5babdb3d98eb8a6ad9edc71108a7/0_79_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5274373936ac645ed5459f7b5991e0a5","title":"revealed development banks funding industrial livestock farms around the world","story":"Investigation uncovers finance worth $2.6bn pumped into meat and dairy industries, despite warnings of links to climate catastrophe Two of the world’s leading development banks have pumped billions of dollars into the global livestock sector, despite warnings that reducing meat and dairy consumption is essential for tackling the climate crisis.The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the commercial lending arm of the World Bank – and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have provided $2.6bn (£2.1bn) for pig, poultry and beef farming, as well as dairy and meat processing, in the past 10 years.The UK government is a major funder of both banks and its own development bank, CDC, has also invested tens of millions of pounds in the global livestock sector over the past decade, including finance for an industrial-scale beef feedlot in Ethiopia and poultry companies in Niger and Uganda.Development banks provide medium and long-term capital for the purpose of economic growth in poorer countries. The IFC and EBRD have both publicly committed to tackling man-made climate change and making investment decisions with the climate in mind.But an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the  has revealed that IFC and EBRD finance – which involved direct investments, loans and other financial support – was used for industrial-scale mega-farms, abattoirs and the expansion of multinational meat and dairy corporations.In one recent case, a beef cattle feedlot in Madagascar, owned by a conglomerate of more than 20 companies, was granted funding worth $3.5m to produce beef for export to the Middle East and the domestic market. In another, Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork company, received a substantial cash injection from the IFC for its activities in Romania.“Expanding production and consumption of meat and dairy is incompatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement,” said Prof Pete Smith, chair in plant and soil science at the University of Aberdeen and a lead author of a landmark UN report about the impact of land use and agriculture on climate change. He cited research showing that a shift to vegetarian or vegan diets, among other food sector and land-use changes, by half of the global population by 2050 is required to meet the Paris goals.“While some investments by development agencies and banks in animal agriculture to improve food security in the world’s poorest nations may be justifiable, massive investments in livestock production systems in countries that already have high levels of consumption, and in multinational meat and dairy companies, clearly is not,” he added.Last week in a landmark climate report the World Bank committed to working with clients to incentivise sustainable diets and “address drivers of increased meat consumption”, and said it was considering advocating for a carbon tax on the livestock sector. The report extolled the climate benefits of plant-based meat substitutes.Jeremy Coller, head of investment firm Coller Capital and founder of responsible finance network Fairr, said that while the financial world was beginning to play its role in lowering greenhouse gases, it was “crazily disjointed and inconsistent for the IFC and EBRD to invest public funds in intensive animal agriculture, one of the world’s highest-emitting industries”.Our analysis of public records and industry data highlights how the banks have financed companies operating across eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Some investments were in countries where meat supply is currently low, such as Ethiopia, but others were made in places where meat consumption per capita is already high or average, such as Ukraine, China and Romania.The dairy sector was the biggest recipient of IFC and EBRD funding, with processing companies and farms receiving more than $1bn. The pig and poultry sectors each received about $500m.The IFC told the Bureau that it is intentionally catering for growing global demand for meat and dairy and that the livestock sector is a key pillar of food security and poverty reduction in many countries. It acknowledged, however, that the sector had a “large environmental and climate footprint”.The impact of each project should be considered against global and national emission budgets, according to Prof Tim Benton, director of the Energy, Environment and Resources programme at Chatham House.But he warned that trying to reduce the carbon footprint of a pint of milk or a single chicken is pointless when demand for those products keeps increasing. “Just because the greenhouse gas efficiency of a unit of meat or dairy has improved, if everybody’s eating more of it, the total emissions that come from meat or dairy might increase.”Both development banks told the Bureau that they assess inidual projects for their carbon emissions. The EBRD added that it had introduced practices to assess climate risks across its entire portfolio.Some of the companies funded by the development banks are multinational agribusinesses or their subsidiaries or affiliates. In 2010, the EBRD took a stake in the eastern European and central Asian subsidiaries of the French group Danone, one of the world’s biggest dairy companies, which generated sales of €25.3bn (£22.5bn) in 2019. The EBRD said that its investment – now ended – had been intended to expand the dairy markets and Danone’s operations in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.Among projects recently approved by the IFC is a loan of $54m to the India-based poultry giant Suguna, the country’s leading chicken supplier and one of the world’s top 10 biggest poultry producers. The company serves export markets as well as Indian consumers.The IFC loan is partly designed to aid the company’s expansion into Kenya and Bangladesh, with finance earmarked for construction of feed mills and hatcheries.The fully integrated agribusiness, which claims to work with 39,000 farms across 18 Indian states, was previously caught up in controversy, after it was alleged that an antibiotic, whose use the WHO had said should be curtailed, was found being used on one of its contract farms. The company denied this.Suguna is not the only India-based poultry company to have been supported by the IFC, with rival Srinivasa receiving an injection of more than $20m in 2018.Smithfield Foods – now part of the Chinese conglomerate WH Group – also benefited from IFC finance, with loans of $60m for its operations in Romania.Smithfield is the world’s largest pig producer and pork processor, and it recently hit global headlines after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close its flagship meatpacking plant in South Dakota, which reportedly supplies 18 million meals a day to US consumers.The UK government has pledged to use its presidency of COP26, the annual UN climate talks, to “green local and international supply chains for foodstuffs and key commodities” and “increase the alignment of financial flows with net-zero”.The CDC told the Bureau it was about to publish a new climate change strategy to make sure agricultural companies it invested in implement “climate smart agricultural practices in order to decrease emissions and increase resilience to a warming climate... It is also important to remember that one in five people living in Africa experience hunger. Alleviating levels of chronic malnourishment and improving food security remain vital development goals.”The IFC accepted that animal protein has “a large environmental and climate footprint, yet it is important to note that its growth is demand driven and linked to people’s dairy and meat consumption preferences”.It justified the investments in the livestock industry by saying that “in most developing countries there is a significant portion of the population that struggles to meet their daily minimum requirements for nutrition, including protein”.An EBRD spokesperson said the bank is “primarily investing in increased efficiency, improvements in energy use along supply chains, improved animal welfare, waste management and utilisation (including manure management), and production of green energy”.The bank also said it actively pursued the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, “including by improving resource efficiency along the meat supply chains from farming to distribution”.Note: Figures are quoted based on money earmarked for specific projects.

That is why we have launched this ground-breaking climate change strategy that will shape every single investment decision we make moving forward.”The bank will allow only rare investments in gas power plants to support the UN’s sustainable development goals, and only in countries that can prove the project is aligned with a wider climate transition plan.This exception is likely to anger climate campaign groups, which would prefer a complete end to all fossil fuel support in favour of renewable energy investments.Others argue that the social and economic benefits of modest fossil fuel investments in areas with very limited energy access would outweigh the incremental increase in emissions they would produce.A recent report on energy in Africa by the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that some new investment in gas-fired power generation would be needed alongside a surge in renewable energy - but the impact on global climate emissions would be negligible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df21dd20ffadfa86376781a236b8215a8de1b6c/0_142_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c05b3210879524e943c3ee42ccd00f8b","title":"airplane film 40th anniversary spoof comedy","story":"The tirelessly joke-packed 1980 film might have dated in some ways but its relentless desire to amuse still makes it an undeniable winnerEven in the anarchic heyday of the Marx brothers at Paramount Pictures, when they turned out vaudevillian free-for-alls such as Horse Feathers and Duck Soup, or Mel Brooks parodies like Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, audiences had never encountered the sheer volume of gags that hit them in Airplane!, which are so relentless that the bad ones don’t have time to develop an odor. There are puns, pratfalls, provocations, foregroundbackground dynamics, double entendres, references to film and TV and popular commercials, random acts of silliness and absurdity, and every possible strain of what would later be categorized as a “dad joke”. Even at 40, when a handful of the references and bits have grown whiskers, Airplane! still absolutely kills. Rarely has a film so eager to please been so successful in doing so.And yet, as easy as it might be to tally up 87 minutes of laughs or marvel at the high batting average of its creative team – David and Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams, better known as Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker (ZAZ) – the non-jokes are a key part of what makes it work. That may sound like asking jazz aficionados to listen between the notes, but the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team understood (at the time, anyway) that a good comedy needs a straight man, and they found one in Zero Hour!, a largely forgotten 1957 drama that served as a primary source of inspiration. And not a source like Top Gun would be to the Abrahams solo projects Hot Shots! and Hot Shots! Part Deux, but the entire foundation on which the comedy would rest.Though Airplane! riffs on the Airport series (particularly Airport 1975) and Irwin Allen disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, it’s a straight-up remake of Zero Hour!, with just a little spin on the ball. Key elements are exactly the same: a hero named Ted Stryker, a former second world war fighter pilot still haunted by the six comrades killed because of a decision he made in combat. A flight he catches at the last minute to win back a woman who’s left him a “Dear John” note. An illness that sweeps through the airplane cabin, debilitating all the passengers who ordered fish instead of meat, including the pilot and the co-pilot. Stryker getting called up to steer the plane to safety, guided on the ground by the no-nonsense captain who was his superior during the war.Not only are some of lines repeated verbatim, but tiny details survive, too, like Stryker’s refusal to stay in the air another two hours until the stormy weather clears, or the ridiculous geysers of sweat that pour down his face as he approaches the landing. Much of the fun of Airplane! comes from Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker’s instinct that just the tone of an average 1957 melodrama would sound funny in 1980, when a more naturalistic style of acting and screenwriting had fully taken over the industry. When the Stryker in Airplane!, stewing bitterly about the pilots who died under his command, says a line like, “A lot of people had plans before the war. Like George Zipp,” it’s hilarious in 1980 (and 2020) in a way it might not have been in 1957. The film goes off on crazier tangents, but often it doesn’t need to depart from Zero Hour! much at all.There’s no better example of the ZAZ approach to the spoof than the casting of Leslie Nielsen as Dr Rumack, the onboard physician who tends to the sick passengers while giving Stryker the occasional pep talk. Though Nielsen had appeared briefly in Kentucky Fried Movie, the anthology comedy ZAZ wrote before Airplane!, he spent the first 25 years of his career as a character actor for film and television, with appearances in Forbidden Planet and the Poseidon Adventure, but nothing that made him a name. His gravitas is all that Airplane! needs in that role, as if he were a time traveler ported in from another cinematic era and not told he was in a comedy. As Nielsen became more self-aware in future ZAZ productions and other spoofs, the effect was diminished.Robert Hays and the wonderful Julie Hagerty play it straight, too, as Stryker and his stewardess girlfriend Elaine, whose love story is dreamily recalled in flashbacks that nod to Saturday Night Fever and From Here to Eternity. Watching Airplane! multiple times, the jokes that stand out tend to be the ones where ZAZ have an idea that’s so outrageously labored, it’s funny just to think about how much they were straining for a laugh. There’s the names, for one, like the “Who’s On First?” confusion of populating the cockpit with men named Oveur, Roger, and Victor (“Over, Oveur. Roger, Roger. What’s your vector, Victor?”), or having Oveur carry on separate phone conversations with someone from the Mayo Clinic and another gentlemen with the surname Ham (“Give me Ham on five, hold the Mayo”). But there’s effort beyond all sorts of other bits, too: the escalation of the fight between parking zone announcers (“You want me to have an abortion!”), the stunt-casting of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ethyl Merman, the willfully idiotic wordplay (“Surely you can’t be serious?” “I am serious, and don’t call me ‘Shirley’”).Not all of Airplane! is timeless, but the “dated” aspects of the film can cut both ways. From the vantage of 2020, we might cringe at the racial comedy of two black men speaking in subtitled “jive”, or Stryker teaching “the Malombo tribe” to play basketball, but it doesn’t matter that Airplane! parodies airplane disaster movies that few have ever seen or references a coffee commercial from the early 70s or Elaine throwing an era-specific Tupperware party for the Malombo women (“This two-quart Seals-M-Rite container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days”). The same goes for future ZAZ classics like Top Secret! and The Naked Gun: rooting a spoof in genre obscurities from Hollywood past turns the absence of timeliness into a secret virtue.That’s the lesson that later spoof series like Scary Movie or other execrable Jason FriedbergAaron Seltzer team-ups like Date Movie or Meet the Spartans never learned. Airplane! does have a few riffs on hits like Jaws and Saturday Night Fever, but it doesn’t give itself over to lazy business of re-staging scenes from the latest blockbusters with the slightest (and often grossest) of twists.It’s weird. It’s unexpected. It’s absurd. And it never pauses for a laugh, because there’s always another one coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c814d3b57102b632c747d117b9ccf09e7949c1/0_98_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a6c249a1309faeb1fb2c8cf4ed197b3","title":"think like a dog review gabriel bateman","story":"A tech-whiz schoolboy discovers how to communicate with wisecracking the family hound in this lightweight adventureThey say an actor should never work with animals or children.

Gabriel Bateman is very likable as a teenage science whiz, but he has his work cut out in scenes opposite his screen mum and dad – a pair of terrifically wooden performances by Megan Fox and Josh Duhamel.Bateman is 13-year-old Oliver, the star pupil at a school for superbrains. He has spent months making a telepathy machine for his school science fair. After a spot of hacking to power up, his machine causes a power surge, and Oliver discovers he can communicate with his pet dog Henry (voiced by Todd Stashwick as a lovable cheerful wisecracker). Pretty soon, the FBI’s cyber security unit is on his tail. An eccentric tech billionaire (Kunal Nayyar) is sniffing around, too. Oliver’s mum and dad are too distracted by their failing marriage to notice – the two are meant to be at the eye-rolling stage of mutual contempt, but Fox and Duhamel look so blank it’s hard to tell.It’s nice to see a world in which geeks really might be taking over. At Oliver’s specialist technology school, even the bully is a nerd (“I’m going to crush you like Edison crushed Tesla”). But this film isn’t really about science.

You can pick one up for as little as three quid, and it does olives as well.If you haven’t got one of these and you’re faced with a recipe asking you to stone 500g of cherries, the most sensible course is to sit down, eat all the cherries and spit the stones out the window. This is, of course, the ultimate test of any cherry recipe: does it represent any sort of improvement on just eating cherries? If it’s close, a stoner may tip the balance.You can buy gadgets that stone six cherries at once, or machines that will stone a whole hopper full but, for a seasonal task like this, a little effort – a little ritual, even – is probably a good thing. It ought to take you a bit of time. There are other satisfactory methods, like this one using a bottle and a chopstick, but you may have to find the right bottleneck for your particular size of cherry. You can also manage the operation – messily – with a paperclip, should you find yourself cooking in an office setting.Nigel Slater’s recipes for cherry pie and cherry polenta cake are both good places to start – they’re straightforward and don’t ask too much of you. One of the difficulties of cherry season is that it arrives just at the point when the weather makes baking seem like a terrible idea. Chill your pastry dough that little bit longer, and find some shade to sit in while you wait.Cherry sorbet sounds an altogether cooler dessert, and Tamal Ray’s recipe requires only about 20 minutes over a hot stove. Better still, it has just three ingredients: cherries, sugar and white wine. Incidentally, if you’re going to end up with a puree, you don’t need to make a fuss about stoning the cherries. Just whack each one with the flat of a knife like you would a clove of garlic the stone will come away easily. Or, as Ray points out, you can cook the cherries whole and remove the stones once they’re soft.Clafoutis is a French dessert – whole cherries (stones left in, traditionally) baked in a batter until just set. Felicity Cloake’s perfect version contains almond essence and kirsch – a morello cherry liqueur which she describes as “ridiculously expensive”. Feel free to leave it out, along with the stones.Alternatively, you could invest in some kirsch for the season, since it is also called for in Liam Charles’s wholly nontraditional cherry bakewell custard tart. There is a lot going on in the name of this dish, but it is not unrelated to the clafoutis: cherries, almond essence and kirsch, baked in custard.This cherry galette also marries cherries and almonds – in this case via frangipane, the almond, flour, butter, sugar and egg paste that occupies a mysterious border realm somewhere between crust and filling. “Galette”, roughly translated, means “don’t worry – it’s supposed to look like that.” White spelt flour is recommended for the pastry, but it’s not a dealbreaker.Rachel Roddy’s cherry and ricotta tart has a latticed crust top with ricotta puffing out from underneath and a cherry filling below that. In Italy the cherries would be sour, but you can make this work with whatever sort you’ve got. The trick is to avoid overcooking the cherries – remove them with a slotted spoon before they turn mushy, reduce the remaining liquid to a syrup, and then put the cherries back in.Cherries and chocolate are another classic combination, most notably in black forest gateau, which is normally made with tinned black cherries, sometimes with the perverse addition of fresh cherries – stalks on – as a decoration. Dan Lepard uses fresh cherries to make the filling first. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall preserves the basic pairing in his cherry chocolate tart, which calls for yet more kirsch. It also requires you to be forward thinking enough to leave the cherries to infuse overnight.For sheer laid-back ease, I love the idea of a “broken cake”: basically any stale cake ripped up and tossed with cherry syrup, fresh fruit, cream or ricotta and other things. It’s hardly even a recipe, and it makes Eton mess look positively ordered.Fresh cherries may just be for summer, but they’re not just for pudding. They can make an appearance in salads, alongside rocket or goat’s cheese or both, with cucumber, basil and quinoa, or roasted, with buttermilk dressing and lettuce.This pickled-cherries recipe (Nigel Slater again – going through his back catalogue, you get the impression he really likes cherries) can be served over mackerel or gammon. And duck with cherry sauce is most definitely a thing. A seasonal glut and a greedy nature will invariably leave you with some less than perfect, slightly post-ripe fruit and the distinct feeling that you never want to look at another cherry again. This will not last, but in the meantime you can make enough jam to see you through the dark, cheerless, cherryless months. This is an easy method, but the jam sugar is not optional: cherries are low in pectin, so they won’t set by themselves. In contrast, this cherry and chia seed jam, from reader Rheanna Lucy Akua Griffin, has no sugar in it: just a little agave nectar or honey.Finally, when you have exhausted all other avenues, make this cherry vodka – absolutely no stoning required. Slit 400g of cherries, heat them with water and sugar until dissolved, cool, add a bottle of vodka, seal the mixture up and leave it for at least four weeks. It’s the poor man’s kirsch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e0df08b3ced2536a950661ab99782eb6ec14f02/0_85_4096_2460/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffcbcc71eee63039222454b7b088dd8a","title":"football quiz guards of honour manchester city liverpool premier league","story":"One of football’s more peculiar traditions will be revived at the Etihad as Manchester City welcome new champions Liverpool"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1010815f78683761d54a4bca3bd25abedf201b/0_325_2212_1326/master/2212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c77807449d6799f0d776709f60e1bc","title":"frank lampard says defeat at west ham is a sign of where chelsea are","story":"Frank Lampard admitted his team are far from the finished article after Chelsea’s 3-2 defeat at West Ham meant they missed out on the chance to leapfrog Leicester into third place in the Premier League.Andriy Yarmolenko’s late goal secured a priceless victory for West Ham after Willian had scored twice for Chelsea, ensuring David Moyes’s side moved three points clear of the relegation zone.But having defeated Manchester City to crown Liverpool as champions and also beaten Leicester to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, Lampard admitted this setback was an indication of how far his team must progress if they are to challenge for the title next season.“It’s a sign of where we are – we have a lot of hard work to do to get to where we want to be,” he said. “The reason the rest of us are chasing Liverpool and Man City is because of the consistency they have developed so that is what we have to work towards. It’s obviously frustrating but if we are in that position it’s how you bounce back and move forward.”Poor defending from Chelsea allowed West Ham to go ahead thanks to goals from Tomas Soucek and Michail Antonio before Willian’s equaliser from a free-kick. Yarmolenko’s goal in the 89th minute means Chelsea still trail Leicester by a point after their defeat to Everton, with Manchester United and Wolves two points behind Lampard’s side.He refused to blame his players for their first defeat since the restart and said they must look ahead to Saturday night’s game against Watford at Stamford Bridge.“I’ve not been let down by my defenders – we’ve made mistakes in the buildup to the goals, not just defenders, which cost us the game,” Lampard said. “I wouldn’t call it a wake-up call because every game is different. This wasn’t a huge surprise – if you know the Premier League and you make mistakes, it can happen. We have to accept it and move on.”West Ham’s victory was their first since the restart and Moyes said it was fully deserved after Soucek’s goal had been controversially ruled out for VAR in the first half.“One win is not enough – we have to win more if we’re still going to be a Premier League club,” he said. “But after the performance that we saw Chelsea put in against Manchester City, it was an outstanding result for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8c309d533d501cea7f492c040cb4aaa3f57a83/257_152_2914_1750/master/2914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84156414e72dec5688b6c5cc17f64f8f","title":"liverpool manchester city premier league","story":"Five years ago, a rampant win at Manchester City contained all the clues for what was to come from the new championsAs Liverpool enter the Etihad Stadium on Thursday they will be greeted by the echoey weirdness that is part of playing football right now. But they will hear the birds sing as the champions baton is passed to them by Manchester City, and for Jürgen Klopp there will also be whispers from a game that took place there five years ago and which can be looked upon as the start of the glory he has brought to the club.Saturday 21 November 2015 – Manchester City 1 Liverpool 4. It was a blitz as emphatic as it was unexpected. A rampant display by those in red and what was up to that point the undoubted high point of Klopp’s reign as Liverpool manager – perhaps not saying much given there had only been seven previous games and three of those had been draws while another was a home defeat to Crystal Palace. Nevertheless, it was the high point, partly because of the result but mainly because of the performance. The first, full-on display of Klopp-ball: Merseyside edition.The visitors were aggressive and explosive, destabilising City with a concerted counterpress and moving the ball not only quickly and sharply but across various angles. Their play was bewitching, summed up by the opening goal, which arrived after only seven minutes and saw Eliaquim Mangala put the ball into his own net after making a mess (typically, some may say) of trying to keep out Roberto Firmino’s cross.“Liverpool have been knocking the ball around with some confidence,” said Martin Tyler on commentary and that was especially evident in their next two goals as Firmino put another cross into the area, this time for Philippe Coutinho to finish, and then, on 32 minutes, the Brazilians switched roles to put Liverpool 3-0 up via the move of the game – patient, confident and studded with a gorgeous backheel by Emre Can. “That is absolutely brilliant,” said Gary Neville, also commentating. The praise was justified. Liverpool had a big lead in the blink of an eye, and while City responded via Sergio Agüero’s strike a minute before half-time they never did enough to reverse the tide that was overwhelming them. Indeed it was Liverpool who scored again via Martin Skrtel’s rasping shot on 81 minutes. Game well and truly over.It was a stunning win. Sure, City were not the side they had been or would become, stuttering as they were through Manuel Pellegrini’s final season in charge, but they were still formidable opposition, especially at home. On this occasion however, in front of their own fans, they had been torn to shreds. “It was a complete disaster,” said Pellegrini after the final whistle, his expression more haunted and haggard than usual.The hard running had been there in previous matches, most strikingly in Klopp’s first in charge – the goalless draw at Tottenham on 17 October. But what elevated this performance above the rest, including the 3-1 victory away to champions Chelsea on Halloween, was its quality and cohesion, and central to this, literally as well as figuratively, was Firmino.The Brazilian went into the City game with his value to Liverpool clouded in uncertainty. Things had not been going well for the 24-year-old since his £29m arrival from Hoffenheim in June, mainly under Brendan Rodgers but also under Klopp. The German had twice started Firmino as a No 10 and once, in the win at Stamford Bridge, as a lone forward, and while he did OK his contributions were neither sparkling or potent. There had been no goals and little to write home about.But that all changed at the Etihad. Firmino was again deployed centrally but this time as a false nine in a three-man frontline, given the licence to move into dangerous positions inside the area and also drift across the attacking line, all the while supported by, and supporting, the forwards either side of him. Sound familiar?It was the start of the Bobbylution, and while Firmino wasn’t the best player on the pitch – that was Coutinho, who started on the left of the front three with Adam Lallana on the right – he was formidable, scoring the first goal of his Liverpool career, providing the assists for two others and generally tormenting City with his guile and swagger. His talents shone (as did those teeth), the first notable contribution from a fundamental figure in the team that has gone on to conquer Europe, the world and actually what mattered most: England.Like the bulletin board in Kujan’s office at the end of The Usual Suspects, it turns out the clues were there all along on that cold Manchester evening. The intent, effort, tactical and technical expertise, and what Klopp has done since is build on those foundations, overhauling his squad to ensure it is capable of achieving the required levels of quality and consistency (Firmino aside, only three players from that matchday squad remain at the club), and fostering a sense of unity on and off the pitch that means Liverpool are not just a hugely successful club but also a happy one.And it is fitting their first game after ending that three-decade yearning for the league title should be against City. The team that has pushed them the hardest and become their most intense rival during the Klopp era – and at whose home the manager’s brilliant fire well and truly burst into life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00130d4104aa03c83c97393fff66996703c5bd75/0_308_4652_2792/master/4652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4594b31fa08b08292a500a31c015dc0c","title":"messis influence troubling finances and boardroom turmoil why barcelona are a mess","story":"Missing out on the Spanish title is perhaps Barça’s smallest problem – decline is setting in and most key players are above 30.

Any lingering hope of winning La Liga had gone. Ten days before Gerard Piqué said it would be “very difficult”. Now, held 2-2 by Atlético Madrid, a third draw in four, it was virtually impossible.At the side of the pitch Sergio Busquets said something about mathematical possibility, which is what players say when they have nothing else. Barcelona had decided to sack manager Ernesto Valverde when they were top and without a replacement ready six months on, they are second, a point behind Real Madrid having played a game more. There are five left and no one is looking forward to those much. That is not the worst of it, either. Defeat, not definitive yet, is one thing decline is another. Capitulation had been coming for a long time they were flawed when they were first and well before that.When the final whistle went Quique Setién turned to the bench, picked up some papers and stood there for a moment. A disciple of Johan Cruyff , this is not how he imagined managing Barcelona. And yet nor can he have been entirely surprised, not least because Cruyff fought battles too and Setién knew he had not been Barça’s first choice. He has problems of his own but most of his team’s precede him. Not least because they are not just the team’s problems they are the club’s.Against Atlético, Antoine Griezmann, Barcelona’s third most expensive player in their history, had been on the pitch four minutes. Ousmane Dembélé, their second most expensive, was not there: injured again, his career in Catalonia slipping from his control or anyone else’s. And as for their most expensive signing, Philippe Coutinho is in Munich on loan because they couldn’t sell him. He will be back soon and they will try to get rid of him again, another plan in pieces.Coutinho was supposed to replace Iniesta, just as Arthur Melo was supposed to replace Xavi. But on Monday Arthur joined Juventus, travelling to Turin still in his Barça tracksuit. They were in a hurry, after all. Juventus paid €72m plus €10m in add-ons Barcelona said but this was effectively a swap deal with Miralem Pjanic, an act of accountancy more creative than the players and driven by finance not football. Driven, above all, by the board’s determination to escape liability for the budgetary shortfall, their short-term survival secured at the cost of deepening and postponing problems until another day.They are not the only successors lost, the only plans gone awry. Neymar, the man who would play alongside and eventually replace Messi, should be taking the lead now. But he became impatient and Barcelona were powerless to prevent him leaving in 2018. They have become locked in a spiral of loss and nostalgia ever since, desperate to make amends to the point where they tried to bring him back again but did not have the money.Worse, the €222m had long been spent, even though one director had insisted that doing so would be an irresponsibility for which they would have to resign. No one did. Not for that, anyway: this spring, six directors walked out, meaning 11 of the 21 board members who began Josep Maria Bartomeu’s mandate have gone. There have also been four sporting directors and as many directors of communication. And it goes back further. In 2014, Luis Suárez, Ivan Rakitic and Marc-André ter Stegen signed. Since then, Barcelona have brought in 28 players for almost €1bn. Those are the ones who did come – the failed pursuit of a striker ended up being comic – and none are an unqualified success.None were easy to shed either, so they sold those they could, not always those they should. Arda Turan was a Barcelona player until Wednesday morning. He has not played for the club in three years. Griezmann eventually came a year later than planned and with no natural slot in the team, early hope floating off with the confetti.Asked why he introduced the Frenchman only in the 90th minute on Tuesday night Setién said the alternative was not to put him on at all. He talked through the other players, the desire to keep Messi and Luis Suárez on, and concluded it was difficult to introduce Griezmann without “destabilising” the team.A more telling line is hard to imagine.The side grow old together and weaker, on the pitch at least. Off it they are powerful still. Ansu Fati is 17, Riqui Puig is 20. They may well be Barcelona’s future too many of those alongside them are Barcelona’s past. Piqué, Suárez, Messi, and Vidal are 33, Rakitic is 32, Busquets and Alba are 31. And still responsibility lies with them.It lies with Messi most of all, a weight he does not always welcome but one he will not, and should not, renounce. He has watched the peak of his career slip by without a European Cup in five years. Sometimes he must look around and wonder what he has done to deserve this. Actually, perhaps that is a more pertinent question than it first appears. There is a deference to him that dominates everything and is not without problems that will take a brave man to broach. Soon, though, someone must.Problems dominate everything, so many they cannot fit on this page, so bad that Messi’s exasperation has been made public. Confrontations between players and board over pay cuts. The Barçagate scandal, the club accused of being behind sock accounts attacking opposition figures and their own players. Messi calling out the sporting director Eric Abidal for blaming the players over Valverde – a man whose ability to keep a lid on tension was not apparent until he had gone, a man some miss now.His charisma may have been quiet but it was there coaching this team – this club – is not as simple as many imagined. “It is what it is,” ran Valverde’s now infamous phrase, drawing intense criticism, but what if he was right? What if Xavi, Koeman, and Pochettino were right when they said no?Setién stepped into the middle. He had seen what Valverde did soon, perhaps, he saw why Valverde did it. Fault lines open easily at Barcelona, widened by the pressure that surrounds everyone. At Celta, footage showed Messi, Suárez and Rakitic apparently ignoring Setién’s assistant, Eder Sarabia. Reports alleged discussions in the dressing room. On Monday night, the president visited Setién’s house.During an unexpectedly revealing and startlingly introspective press conference, Barcelona’s manager said: “I wasn’t an easy player to handle either,” adding: “I have to free my conscience.“I have no problem admitting this is a new situation for me and I’m in one of those moments when you’re finding out many things. Bit by bit you do what you want to do. We all have to give a bit of ourselves, players included, for the good of the team. This is a team and it has to act as one.”It may be facile, opportunistic, but a photo from Tuesday night brought that comment to mind once more, perhaps offering a portrait of where they are. During a drinks break, Atlético’s players are pictured gathered around Diego Simeone, as one. Barcelona’s are dispersed.Some substitutes linger, others sit in the stands. Among them is Arthur, just sold to Juventus to save the board from a crisis of their own making on the eve of meeting Atlético, a game the president does not attend. One that starts with the league title at stake and ends with it virtually gone, each player going their own way at the full-time whistle.Messi was the first off. The humiliation burning, Griezmann was the last. He had friends to talk to on the other team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75841ff0963597efdba0c6e635650175c9a98d28/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=99b4f5fc182a7b4f7c990650efc6a03d","title":"uk treasury faces backlash after hailing pubs reopening on saturday","story":"Critics says tweet encouraging patrons to ‘grab a drink’ is in poor taste given UK’s Covid-19 death tollThe Treasury has been accused of taking an irresponsible approach to the coronavirus epidemic after a backlash to a post on its official Twitter account that hailed Saturday’s scheduled reopening of England’s pubs.“Grab a drink and raise a glass, pubs are reopening their doors from 4 July,” the tweet read, while a graphic carried the message: “Pubs are back”.Many of those condemning the post, which was soon deleted, accused its celebratory tone of being in poor taste given that the virus has killed at least 43,000 people in the UK.The tweet came as Leicester was put back under lockdown conditions amid a localised outbreak and fears were expressed about numbers of cases being seen in Greater Manchester.The Labour MP Geraint Davies said: “This is wholly irresponsible publicity by the Conservative government, which will fuel a resurgence of coronavirus infection and death in England.”Boris Johnson has been criticised over his confused messaging at a time of national crisis. While he warned people not to “overdo it” as he announced the lifting of some lockdown measures on 23 June, he also said: “Frankly, I can’t wait to go to a pub or a restaurant even if it’s not compatible with the diet that I’m on.“I think people need to go out, I think people need to enjoy themselves and rediscover things that they have been able to do for a long time. I want to see bustle. I want to see activity.”He told seaside towns to “show some guts” when asked how they might be expected to deal with the possibility of crowds flocking to take advantage of the hot weather and loosening rules. And he added: “It is very, very important that people who do represent seaside communities, places where UK tourists will want to go, should be as welcoming as they can possibly be.”Shortly afterwards, he condemned people “taking too many liberties” as a major incident was declared on the south coast due to large crowds on the beaches.The Treasury has not responded to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2383b1362b925acf560e6eb61065b6100b545ae8/0_85_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abf31a17a5f869d4a87e01f1ee750eed","title":"matsepo ramakoae and lesothos lost chance to elect its first female leader","story":"After the resignation of Thomas Thabane the small south African nation could have addressed its huge political gender imbalance. What happened?Lesotho, a tiny mountain kingdom in southern Africa, has always been dwarfed in size and achievements by its neighbour South Africa.Many people around the world were not even aware of Lesotho’s existence until the beginning of this year when then prime minister Thomas Thabane and his third wife, Maesaiah Thabane, were accused of murdering Thabane’s estranged second wife, Lipolelo, in 2017.The ensuing murder case and the ousting of Thabane by his own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party, thrust Lesotho on to the international stage.While the episode showed Lesotho in a negative light, the resultant vacancy at the State House did give the tiny country an opportunity to get one over on its more illustrious neighbour by doing what South Africa failed to do in 2018 – appointing its first ever female prime minister.South Africa had the opportunity to install Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma after the resignation of her ex-husband, Jacob Zuma, but the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ended up narrowly choosing Cyril Ramaphosa.Its a similarity not lost on Matsepo Ramakoae, a battle-hardened veteran of the ABC’s and Lesotho’s treacherous political terrain, who stepped forward in May as candidate for the post of prime minister. But, like South Africa, Lesotho’s ruling politicians instead chose a man: former finance minister Moeketsi Majoro, who has just succeeded Thabane.Not that Majoro, a savvy former International Monetary Fund (IMF) staffer, is not well-qualified. But when a woman candidate with arguably better credentials steps forward, it would have gone a long way in making up for Lesotho’s failure to fulfil a decades-old pledge to ensure equal representation of women in positions of power by 2015.“I believe I have the qualities to be prime minister,” Ramakoae tells the .The 66-year-old politician is a founding member of the ABC. Thabane appointed her deputy finance minister in 2012, and she is savvy enough to appeal to the international community with her solid grasp of development issues.Unlike Majoro and most other ABC members, she refrained from taking sides in the factional fights that have now battered the party for more than a year. She would have been an ideal oil for these factional troubled waters.“I am of the view that despite whatever procedures of selection are followed, if everything is done in a broad daylight with observation of democratic systems of fair and equal opportunity of competition, I can become the next prime minister.“My party has the majority. I am a member of parliament for Matsieng, I have my own constituency and I can be elected. I have experience. I’ve been in the civil service for a long time. I have also been in parliament,” she says.But it was not to be for the former career civil servant and as even the stride forward that saw a female speaker, Ntlhoi Motsamai, elected was reversed with a male replacement in new speaker, Sephiri Motanyane, Lesotho is again looking at a gulf of gender underrepresentation.After the most recent general election in June 2017, only 27 of the 120 seats are held by women, a decline from 30 seats in 2015.The main ruling coalition partner, the ABC, fielded just seven female candidates in the June 2017 polls. Only three won and junior coalition partners fared even worse – the Basotho National Party (BNP), led by a former minister of gender, Thesele Maseribane, had 16 female candidates, none of whom won and the Reformed Congress of Lesotho, the only party led by a woman, Keketso Rantšo, won no seats at all.Marematlou Freedom Party, the only party to field an equal 30 female and 30 male candidates, had only won one victory: a man.It seems achieving equal representation in Lesotho remains a pipe dream, exacerbated by the fact that even when a woman steps forward, as Ramakoae did, she is passed over. But it has provoked anger.The former deputy speaker Teboho Lehloenya says the under-representation of women was a clear indication that Lesotho has to take urgent action.“Efforts to empower women and elevate them to positions of power and decision-making have been made, but the progress is painstakingly sluggish and as a result woman are still under represented in parliament,” Lehloenya says.“Among other factors that deter women from contesting for political power are the intimidation and violence they encounter in the race to elections. It is therefore imperative for policymakers to initiate efforts to eliminate these barriers and expedite process to increase female representation in positions of power and decision-making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites.

Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5d25fc33389e4cf96895ee55e059c096613bb7/0_255_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35b507d282840afabe8a4114f86ef02","title":"complicated history of swing low sweet chariot needs to be taught and honoured","story":"It’s been sung at Twickenham since at least the mid-60s but it’s now time to respect the spirit behind its undeniable powerEven back before it became a flashpoint in the culture wars, there were all sorts of stories about why, how and when the Twickenham crowd took to singing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. For a long time it was supposed to have started as a spontaneous celebration of Chris Oti’s hat-trick against Ireland in 1988. Then a researcher turned up footage of fans singing it at the Middlesex Sevens in 1987, when Martin Offiah was playing for Rosslyn Park. Which fits, since his nickname was “Chariots” Offiah. In the past few weeks that seems to have become something like the official history. But the truth is not so neat.Take this, from an article written by Ivor Turnbull published in Tatler on 26 November 1966: “One of the more agreeable vocal traditions of the West Park bar at Twickenham has disappeared as the result of the authorities’ decision to split the old 30-yards-long bar into something like a cell block. The West Bar was always the gathering place for the most determinedly cheerful supporters after a big game and it accounts for a fair proportion of the 20,000 pints that are consumed after an international.“Sooner or later some group would start to sing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot and, in a minute or so, the several hundred beer-charged customers, already packed shoulder to shoulder, would sway as one man. As togetherness, it would have delighted Billy Graham.”So they’ve been singing Swing Low at Twickenham since at least the mid-60s. The real origins of the song go back a hundred years again and they’re pretty obscure, even though it’s often attributed to a Choctaw freedman called Wallace Willis. Arthur Jones, Professor Emeritus of Music, History, and Culture at the University of Denver explains: “I know there’s a story about Wallace Willis, but in the oral history there are just all kinds of accounts of this song having been a slave song, and Wallace probably learned it that way.”Jones describes Swing Low as a signal song: “On one level it’s about people hoping they can escape their misery by riding on this imaginary chariot to heaven, but another clear meaning is the idea that the chariot is a metaphor for escaping to freedom.”Jones has been singing these songs since he was a child. He set up the Spirituals Project to preserve and revitalise them. He knows nothing about rugby and didn’t know Swing Low had been adopted by England’s fans until a journalist told him in 2017. “When I first heard I was shocked, I was told that people sang it in pubs, and that it had evolved some blue connotations, and if that was true I felt like that was truly disrespectful.”It is true, there are a set of idiotic gestures that used to sometimes go along with the song. It’s also true that you seldom – if ever – see fans using them any more.Jones says there are “extremists who say ‘if you’re not black you can’t sing these songs’”. He disagrees. “That’s ridiculous. I feel like if the song is being sung by the fans when their team scores, if they know the origins, and want to borrow it, if it is a fun, positive thing for them to do, then that’s OK. But for people to vehemently distort its history, or claim it belongs to them, that’s really disrespectful.”You couldn’t ban it anyway, (although the Nazi party did put it on a list of “undesired and harmful” songs). “You can’t contain something that has that much cultural power,” Jones says. “It has to be shared and even if you don’t want to share it, it is going to be shared.”Swing Low has that power. Which is why it’s been sung by so many people, including Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash and Joan Baez. “Most of those artists would acknowledge that they love singing it but it’s a song that comes out of the African-American tradition of slave songs,” Jones says “It’s important to do that. One of the reasons why this topic is so sensitive is that one of the few things African-American people can claim that they own is their culture, like songs and stories and games, that originally didn’t have any money attached to them. So there is a lot of sensitivity attached to people taking them. It’s like you’re taking everything from us.“Music does evolve, it changes. We have African-American opera singers who sing Puccini and Mozart, but they treat those songs with respect, they acknowledge the origins and they honour the roots of the music.”That, beneath the inflammatory headlines, beyond all the back-and-forth of opinions, is the crux of it. The Rugby Football Union has commercialised this song and profited from it. While they are running reviews into its use they could look at some other things, too. Look at whether, for instance, they ought to do more to honour the forgotten black international Jimmy Peters. For 118 years, Peters was the only black man to play for England. There are still unanswered questions about whether the prejudice he faced cut short his international career.Look at why, even though the England team is more erse than it has ever been, the 14-person RFU board doesn’t have a single BAME member and why there is only one black person among the 61 on the RFU Council. Look at why Sport England’s recent Sport For All survey showed the Asian and Black communities were significantly under-represented in youth and adult rugby in England compared to other ethnic groups.The RFU wants to improve “education and awareness” about Swing Low, that’s easy to do – consult experts, like Jones, put up plaques, put out films, take down sponsored banners. The more important part is far harder and that’s pushing through the structural change that honours the spirit of the song."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e029471efdd29979782b3b6b38e2004bcca58a11/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a51d8b6cd8c4f71a0ae05e1300b1878d","title":"f1 2020 team by team guide to the cars and drivers","story":"Lewis Hamilton has repeatedly had an edge over the field with Mercedes and this time he can match Michael Schumacher’s record of seven world titlesAlready six-time consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ champions, achieving the seventh double is entirely feasible.

The Scuderia have focused on improving the car’s downforce to make it more competitive at a greater number of circuits. Aggressive and successful development will be key as might be the potentially difficult task of keeping the peace between their drivers.No 5 Debut USA 2007 Wins 53 Poles 57 Titles 4 Last season 5th Out-raced by his rookie teammate Leclerc last season, Vettel has a point to prove but with Ferrari not renewing his contract and Leclerc in favour his No 1 status is long gone. Still prone to errors under pressure, he needs the serenity of success from the off.Hugely impressive last season, seven poles the best tally of any driver. Will be even more confident and more aggressive this time round. Ferrari have said they will let their drivers race so Leclerc will look to put Vettel under the cosh immediately.In testing, the closest rivals to Mercedes. The RB16 looks strong and Honda’s engine close to parity with Mercedes and Ferrari. Confidence is high that they can really challenge and for the first time in recent years appear to be quick out of the box, the Red Bulls pleasingly resurgent.Showing every indication of now being a more complete driver, Verstappen has all the tools to fight for the title and if he has the car this year, intends to grasp his chance. Never intimidated and with control to match his exuberance, he can take the fight to Mercedes.Parachuted in from Toro Rosso midway through his rookie season, the London-born driver who races under the Thai flag was hugely impressive. Earned his place and can be expected to only improve. Must be in the mix at the front to support Verstappen.Building on their strongest result since 2012, best of the rest remains the target as McLaren reap the rewards of a structural changes. Their car still has room for improvement but showing consistency and focus, McLaren and their two charging drivers will expect to be in the fight for fourth.Last year he delivered on the promise he has always shown, so much so that Ferrari have signed him for 2021. Sainz has touch and intelligence, is comfortable and confident at McLaren and will want to bid farewell with a flourish.An outstanding debut last season that included some remarkable qualifying runs, outshining his more experienced teammate was just the platform Norris needed. Determined to work on his weaknesses and now entirely confident in an F1 car, he will be even stronger second time out.Disappointing last season performing poorly for a works team targeting the title, Renault have to be in the fight for fourth, especially with the company considering its future in F1. The driver pairing is strong, but it is Ocon who may have inherited the No 1 spot after Ricciardo’s decision to jump ship to McLaren for 2021.After a scrappy 2019 Ricciardo wants more. He has the class to deliver but has been frustrated by Renault’s failure to move forward. Still one of the best overtakers, but the Australian may have to take some early licks as the team come up to speed.Back from a year out after two seasons with Force India, Ocon is highly rated and will expect to prove it in a decent car. The Frenchman has speed, consistency and no little bravura in being unafraid to get his elbows out. Potentially a compelling combination.Rebranded and with a fetching new livery, testing was positive enough for Tost to posit fifth place as their target and Sainz picked them out as a threat to McLaren. If Honda’s engine delivers they will likely be in that scrap.No 10 Debut Malaysia 2017 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th Demoted mid-season last year from Red Bull, but showed strength in keeping it together to finish well for Toro Rosso, including a second place in Brazil. The car suited him, as it appears to this year, and will be eager to show he has improved.Solid last season for another driver who has been through the Red Bull promotion and demotion mill. Can still impress, as he did with third in Germany last year, but needs to improve his qualifying performances if he is to match his teammate.Car RP20 Engine Mercedes Principal Otmar Szafnauer Debut Belgium 2018 GPs 30 Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th Took a lot of flak for designing their car around last year’s title-winner, the “Pink Mercedes” is unsurprisingly very quick. Will be in the fight for best of the rest and a bullish team have targeted podium finishes. Sustaining their charge across the season may be more challenging.Having made a long-term commitment to the team he has already served for some time, Pérez is the confident and capable pair of hands they need. A proven points-scorer, this might be his chance to show how good he is in a fight that could feature the big three.Stroll’s chance to make a point, too. With decent machinery he can prove he is not just driving because of his father’s largesse. To do so he must drastically improve the qualifying performances which have left him repeatedly playing catchup.To follow last year’s aggressive design philosophy, Alfa once more have evolved their concept well how far they can take it is the challenge. Expect early gains but without the resources to develop it much beyond those peaks.F1’s grand old man seems to be enjoying his racing out of the spotlight more than ever. Still on course to take the record for most race starts if the season can deliver enough meetings, Raikkonen is also guaranteed to return points for Alfa.Well beaten by Raikkonen, the Italian needs to step up in his second full season. Unnecessary errors have been costly but he has shown glimpses of pace, particularly in qualifying. Challenging the Finn would be a real achievement.Car VF-20 Engine Ferrari Principal Guenther Steiner Debut Australia 2016 GPs 83 Titles 0 Best finish 5th Last season 9th Gene Haas has warned he will consider Haas’s future in F1 based on how his team perform this season. This year’s car has at least eliminated the tyre-wear problems that plagued them but they do not appear particularly quick. Desperately need their drivers to keep it clean too, if not to further enrage Steiner and Haas.Unforced errors and misjudgments have peppered Grosjean’s career yet can on his day be very quick. Struggled with the car last year but looks more comfortable now, his future in F1 surely depends on consistently delivering this time.K-Mag remains fiercely independent, uncompromising and aggressive. Can be compelling to watch, albeit painfully so sometimes for those on his pitwall. If Haas are in a dogfight at the back of the grid, Magnussen could be the tool they need.Rejoining the midfield is the target after last year’s battering while the proposed sale of the team hangs heavy over them, but they may yet attract the required investment. The car is quicker, has more downforce and is less of a handful to drive, all positive signs. Major advances are not expected but they target making it to Q2 and being in the back-of-the-field fight.Did superbly to weather the storm last year, which he handled impressively. Now team leader, Russell is gaining experience the hard way but he has done so well and his talent will be on show if Williams can get among the other teams.Backed by billionaire father Michael, he drove six practice sessions for Williams last year and is well-liked at the team. A solid pair of hands for a rookie but must rise to the challenge, as Russell did last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf35ff3dd8e82fe39a25be8502e34ee3451f262/199_49_3834_2302/master/3834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ebeab79753e3b74a33080b83436b6f","title":"the greatest martina navratilova enduring champion brave herself tennis","story":"The nine-time Wimbledon singles champion’s legacy has never been about only records, titles and longevity. She possessed a power that upended everything: identity  • Who’s your choice? Have your sayHana Mandlikova was an enthusiastic member of the Sparta tennis club in Prague at 12 years old. She acted as ball girl when the ladies played league matches, and there was one young woman whose explosive style of play she admired more than anyone else’s. But Mandlikova was shy, and couldn’t bring herself to speak to her.Eleven years later Mandlikova defeated her hometown hero, Martina Navratilova, in the 1985 US Open final, when the latter was at the peak of her powers. Their match-ups were too few to earn the kind of rivalry immortalised by history. Mandlikova’s Martina moments were squeezed in between Navratilova’s famed decade-long tug-of-war with Chris Evert and the old-timer-newcomer smackdown with Steffi Graf. And yet for a couple of years in the mid-80s, Mandlikova spurred her idol to some extraordinary displays.There was a spectacular semi-final in the 1985 Virginia Slims Championships – where Mandlikova’s ability to stand up to her former countrywoman’s powerful serve sparked fireworks – and a four-set showcase of Navratilova’s shotmaking in the same tournament the following year. Three months later, they met in the 1986 Wimbledon final.Navratilova practically held the lease on Centre Court. She had won six singles titles, the previous four of them in a row. The seven doubles titles were mere window dressing. But Mandlikova broke her first service game, and was 5-2 up at the ball change, Navratilova biting a lip as she walked back to her seat. In the next game, when her opponent hit a backhand return down the line, Navratilova kissed her fingers in appreciation. And then – as if enough was enough – the world No 1 started raining down serves like Jove hurling lightning.What followed was an exhibition of Navratilova’s peak serve-and-volley game. She covered the net with the apparent wing of a Boeing 737 she leapt for the ball like an exploding star. There were impossible pick-ups from her ankles, catapulting cross-court runs and devastating deep-court volleys. Mandlikova kept fighting but she could not fight the hurricane.The following year, Navratilova took her eighth Wimbledon title, against Graf, the 18-year-old wunderkind who had defeated her at Roland Garros and was supposed to herald the end of her reign. Graf kept fighting, too, but the woman 12 years her senior overwhelmed her. As they waited for the trophy presentation, Graf joked: “How many more Wimbledons do you want?”“Nine is my lucky number,” said Navratilova. She got what she wanted.You cannot fight the hurricane. And that’s what Navratilova was destined to be, from the moment she took Evert to three sets in the 1975 French Open, or perhaps the one later that year, when she left her family to become a teenage immigrant with an eastern European accent in a country that didn’t much care for outsiders. It’s what she promised when she served out to love to win her first grand slam in 1978, beating Evert for only the fifth time in 25 attempts, and what she proved in 1984 with her 74-match winning streak, the longest in tennis history.Navratilova’s prominence has never been just about records and titles, although the pure mathematics of her achievements – 167 singles titles, 177 doubles titles, 59 majors – broke every pre-existing algorithm. The magnitude of her career cannot simply be expressed by its longevity, even if she beat the 19-year-old world No 1 Monica Seles in the Paris Open when she was almost twice her age, or lifted the US Open mixed doubles trophy when she was a year off her half-century and her partner, Bob Bryan, looked like a nephew who had come round to help her set up her computer.Navratilova possessed a power that upended everything it blew through a world that wasn’t ready and didn’t know what to call it. We recognise it now as identity – an authenticity of self that our zeitgeist encourages and rewards. But for most of Navratilova’s 31-year career, her iniduality – the one that inspired her to value physical strength and look more muscular than a woman was supposed to, to live openly with a female partner and to speak out for what she believed – carried a personal cost.It’s easy to forget the support and sponsorships she lost, and the suspicion and vilification she attracted, for being unapologetically herself – especially now she is an international treasure, a beloved pundit, a recurring cameo as Gwyneth Paltrow’s lover on a Netflix comedy drama. When Navratilova came out in 1981 it was to a world that associated gay people with Aids and was largely comfortable in its endemic, institutional homophobia. When she criticised the US government, it was to a sporting fanbase that demanded all-American heroes and a media that labelled her unpatriotic.It took time for western culture to catch up with Navratilova’s non-conformity. Her endurance and undying passion to play tennis enriched her legacy, because the longer she continued, the more people were able to appreciate and understand her: the humour and warmth, the soft centre of a personality they once took for severe.Still, her most inspiring attribute has long been apparent. Mandlikova once spoke of her vivid memory of discovering her hero was leaving Czechoslovakia, never to come back. “That,” she said, “that was braveness.” It was the quality that made Navratilova a leader in her time, and for ours.She may have been born in Prague, she may now live in Texas but, to Martina Navratilova, Wimbledon is her spiritual home and the Centre Court crowd her family. ‘I love this place,’ she declared on Saturday. And so she should, having taken her total of winning finals to seven by beating Hana Mandlikova 7-6, 6-3 after possibly her most testing first-set examination … For months Navratilova has struggled to find her serving rhythm. Even she had come to recognise its lethal quality had gone. ‘And all that was wrong was the toss, nothing else,’ she explained. ‘Once it came together I didn’t feel anything could go wrong. When you feel that confident, the rest of your game falls into place.’David Irvine, the , 7 July 1986"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef8e35f1aad957ee347e999b2779815ca2723558/0_50_3666_2200/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2342ebfa01d65b30d512f4653d8b1e47","title":"washington nickname change nfl football","story":"The term ‘Redskins’ is seen as offensive by many people across America. In the current climate, a name change does not seem out of the questionSam Bardley says he got serious about making a feature-length documentary film about Native American names, logos and mascots in sports in 2013, about 20 years after the nickname of Washington DC’s NFL team became a national issue.The resulting film is Imagining the Indian: The Fight Against Native American Mascoting. Bardley and the film’s other producers hope they can raise funds to finish the film and premiere it at the Sundance Film Festival next January.“Everyone kind of knows the history,” Bardley, who is from Washington DC, tells the . “No one takes the time to see why it is so insidious.”The film covers much more ground than just the backstory of the “Redskins” nickname – widely considered to be an offensive racial slur. The team’s owner Dan Snyder has refused to change since he bought the franchise in 1999.But the story is now moving faster than a two-minute drill. This specific controversy has heated up again in the past month, in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd.The death of Floyd, an African American, would seem to have little connection with the debate over an NFL team’s nickname in a city 1,100 miles from Minneapolis, where he died. But there is a string: for one, mass protests over racism and police brutality have been held after Floyd’s death in Washington, the nation’s capital.Further, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said “we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier” when they protested over issues such as police brutality and racial injustice. More directly, in June, Washington participated in #blackouttuesday, an online protest against racism and police brutality, drawing criticism from, among others, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic US representative from New York.“Want to really stand for racial justice? Change your name,” she tweeted at the football team – and her 7m followers.The issue has escalated since. Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, said on 12 June it was “past time” for the football team to change its nickname. Columnists and editorial boards have joined in.“This was in no way planned,” says Ben West, one of the directors of the film. “We thought with many others that this is an important topic. It seems like there’s real momentum out there to continue the conversation.”It turns out that the nickname issue is about much more than a slur. Many Washingtonians have a longstanding and unresolved issue with the late George Preston Marshall, who founded the team nearly 90 years ago.Marshall was one of four original owners of an NFL team launched in Boston in 1932. The team played its home games at the home of the Boston Braves, the city’s National League baseball team. So the football team, as was the custom then, was also first called the Braves.The coach of the renamed Boston team was William Henry “Lone Star” Dietz, a former player at Carlisle Indian Industrial School in south-central Pennsylvania and coach of the football team at what is now known as Haskell Indian Nations University, in Lawrence, Kansas. Dietz had four Native Americans on the Boston team and favored the unconventional, wide-open and entertaining “Indian” style of football at Carlisle and Haskell. He bought into Marshall’s efforts to add a Native American motif, including war paint and headdresses – even though Dietz apparently was not a native Sioux, but a German-American from Wisconsin who faked his way into Carlisle.“People used to use that as a shield” for rationalizing the team’s name, says Bardley.Although the team drew poorly when it was in Boston, Marshall kept the nickname and the Native American motif when he moved his team after the 1936 season to Washington, where he owned a chain of laundries. The team added its famous fight song in 1938 (the last line of the song, now “Fight for Old DC” was originally “Fight for Old Dixie”.)What Marshall did not add until 1962, however, were African American players – 16 years after other NFL teams resumed signing black players. Washington was the southernmost team in the NFL for many years, and Marshall wanted to appeal to white ticket buyers.Stewart Udall, the US Secretary of the Interior, finally told Marshall to add black players or lose his lease at DC Stadium. Marshall drafted Ernie Davis, the running back from Syracuse who in 1961 became the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy, but Davis said he would not play for Marshall. So he was traded to Cleveland for another black player, Bobby Mitchell.Mitchell was a star in Washington and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1983. He died in April at the age of 84, and the team announced last week that his jersey number, 49, would be only the second in franchise history to be retired.Only when Mitchell joined the team did more black Washingtonians follow the team. Some black residents of DC still don’t like the home team. Bardley says there are a lot of black Dallas Cowboys fans in Washington.The team also announced last week that the lower level at FedEx Field, their stadium in Landover, Maryland, would be named after Mitchell instead of Marshall. One day earlier, a statue of Marshall at DC Stadium, later renamed RFK Stadium, was removed by stadium overseers. The franchise also confirmed Marshall’s name will be removed from all official team material.Snyder wants another new stadium, and Bowser and others have said the District of Columbia won’t even think about building one if he sticks with the nickname. Plus, Snyder could sell a lot of team merchandise if he changes the name.“I don’t think he’ll do it willingly,” Bardley says. “It would be great to see he had the foresight to be brave. In that respect, he can even look heroic.”Snyder, who is often cast as an NFL villain, has a chance to to look more heroic than Abe Pollin, the late owner of the NBA team in Washington, who changed the nickname to Wizards from Bullets in 1996 because of the violent connotation of the word.If Snyder moves on the nickname issue, the documentary would need an update. The filmmakers sound as if they are fine to put in extra hours doing so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eea0b0480f62fb675f7bb168af423c7ef38c076/0_0_4213_2528/master/4213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06ce5734938bc91a7b6bc167c0de65e4","title":"black theatre collective calls for industry reform not empty gestures","story":"Newly formed group sends open letter to UK theatres , suggesting five measures to make the industry more inclusiveMore than 400 actors and theatre figures, including Paapa Essiedu, Clarke Peters and Hamilton star Jamael Westman, have called on the British theatre industry to implement “actionable reform” that would make the sector more inclusive and less hostile to people of colour.As the Black Lives Matter movement draws attention to structural racism and Covid-19 threatens ersity in theatre, the newly formed Black Theatre Collective (BTC), which includes some of Britain’s best-known stage actors and writers, has sent an open letter to the UK’s theatre-makers calling for action rather than “empty gestures”.The letter says erse theatre-makers have been failed, and cites examples such as actors being given black tights and being told they are “skin-tone” and the “dog-whistle racist language bemoaning ‘ersity’ in a review”. The letter says actors are often the only people of colour working on productions with offstage roles being the preserve of white employees.The open letter was sent to the UK’s artistic directors, executive directors, producers and members of the Society of London Theatre (Solt) on Thursday morning.The BTC suggests five measures for UK theatre to “create antiracist workplaces, equal for all your performers”. They call for institutions to hire and retain erse talent “across all departments”, for reviewers from a more erse list of publications to be given access to press events, and for outreach programmes to be set up in schools in order to encourage participation in theatre from underrepresented groups.The BTC’s other two recommendations are for hair and makeup teams to be trained in how to work with afro hair by summer 2021, and that the “appropriate skin tone makeup, underwear and physio strapping” is given to actors.“Across industries, from sport to education to publishing we have witnessed an unprecedented level of self-examination, attempting to address complicity in racism … as an industry, we must not be above this rigorous self-examination,” the letter states.It adds that many of the signatories had hope when theatres posted messages of support for the Black Lives Matter movement. “Yet, this optimism was tinged with the realism of our lived experience whilst working alongside many of you and the times when you have failed us,” it continues.“We stand alongside you in this moment of self-reflection optimistic that newly awakened to these failures we shall make concerted efforts to address industry-wide issues that alienate your Black colleagues,” the letter adds. “We cannot accept empty gestures.”The playwright Gbolahan Obisesan, who is among the signatories, told the  in June that erse talent does not trust the theatre sector and that Covid-19 means already “disenfranchised creatives of colour and freelance artists will be even more underrepresented and pushed out meaning moving away from the industry completely”.In May, an open letter was sent to the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, signed by 60 leading figures in British theatre. It said that as the industry faces financial turmoil and institutions go into administration and close their doors, ersity cannot be forgotten and needs to be protected in policy decisions.1. Hire and retainOnce offstage, the inclusivity of all departments drops immensely. Respect Black lives and careers the same way you do Black Music and Culture.You will commit to seeking out erse teams across all departments, truly representative of the Britain we live in today.These figures will be reported back annually to Bectu and Equity representatives.2. Hair and wigsBlack performers often feel unsupported in the hair department, creating unnecessary tension due to lack of training.By Summer 2021 you will ensure that Wig Heads of Department and their deputies are trained in Afro Hair.3. Makeup and costumeThere are several companies that provide appropriate skin tone makeup, underwear and physio strapping.When providing these for cast members, the appropriate provision will be made.As a cultural ecosystem we are defined by our audiences. If we want to be truly inclusive, we will make space on Press Nights for a broader scope of publications to allow our work to be seen and critiqued by a erse and equally important audience.The next generation of theatre-makers are currently in our education system. We must ensure that they have access to our World-class theatre so that they may stand alongside us in a few years’ time. They must not be dissuaded or denied access because of the colour of their skin or their parents’ financial situation. So, we call on all of us, both subsidised and commercial theatre alike to identify pupils and young people from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds to partake in educational performances and workshops.We have an opportunity to stand together as a community. It may not be easy, but it is right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1b395a583f8fcdbf8eab7fffc31e8ff9ff2055/0_0_6944_4167/master/6944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=135b45429e183e8b94433743f7f00cfe","title":"whatsapp groups conspiracy theories disinformation democracy","story":"As social media has become more inhospitable, the appeal of private online groups has grown. But they hold their own dangers – to those both inside and out. By  William DaviesAt first, many of the new uses were heartening. Mutual aid groups sprung up to help the vulnerable. Families and friends used the app to stay close, sharing their fears and concerns in real time. Yet by mid-April, the role that WhatsApp was playing in the pandemic looked somewhat darker. A conspiracy theory about the rollout of 5G, which originated long before Covid-19 had appeared, now claimed that mobile phone masts were responsible for the disease. Across the UK, people began setting fire to 5G masts, with 20 arson attacks over the Easter weekend alone.WhatsApp, along with Facebook and YouTube, was a key channel through which the conspiracy theory proliferated. Some feared that the very same community groups created during March were now accelerating the spread of the 5G conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, the app was also enabling the spread of fake audio clips, such as a widely shared recording in which someone who claimed to work for the NHS reported that ambulances would no longer be sent to assist people with breathing difficulties.This was not the first time that WhatsApp has been embroiled in controversy. While the “fake news” scandals surrounding the 2016 electoral upsets in the UK and US were more focused upon Facebook – which owns WhatsApp – subsequent electoral victories for Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Narendra Modi in India were aided by incendiary WhatsApp messaging, exploiting the vast reach of the app in these countries. In India, there have also been reports of riots and at least 30 deaths linked to rumours circulating on WhatsApp. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has sought ways of regulating WhatsApp content, though this has led to new controversies about government infringement on civil liberties.As ever, there is a risk of pinning too much blame for complex political crises on an inert technology. WhatsApp has also taken some steps to limit its use as a vehicle for misinformation. In March, a WhatsApp spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company had “engaged health ministries around the world to provide simple ways for citizens to receive accurate information about the virus”. But even away from such visible disruptions, WhatsApp does seem to be an unusually effective vehicle for sowing distrust in public institutions and processes.A WhatsApp group can exist without anyone outside the group knowing of its existence, who its members are or what is being shared, while end-to-end encryption makes it immune to surveillance. Back in Britain’s pre-Covid-19 days, when Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn were the issues that provoked the most feverish political discussions, speculation and paranoia swirled around such groups. Media commentators who defended Corbyn were often accused of belonging to a WhatsApp group of “outriders”, co-ordinated by Corbyn’s office, which supposedly told them what line to take. Meanwhile, the Conservative party’s pro-Brexit European Research Group was said to be chiefly sustained in the form of a WhatsApp group, whose membership was never public. Secretive coordination – both real and imagined – does not strengthen confidence in democracy.WhatsApp groups can not only breed suspicion among the public, but also manufacture a mood of suspicion among their own participants. As also demonstrated by closed Facebook groups, discontents – not always well-founded – accumulate in private before boiling over in public. The capacity to circulate misinformation and allegations is becoming greater than the capacity to resolve them.The political threat of WhatsApp is the flipside of its psychological appeal. Unlike so many other social media platforms, WhatsApp is built to secure privacy. On the plus side, this means intimacy with those we care about and an ability to speak freely on the negative side, it injects an ethos of secrecy and suspicion into the public sphere. As Facebook, Twitter and Instagram become increasingly theatrical – every gesture geared to impress an audience or deflect criticism – WhatsApp has become a sanctuary from a confusing and untrustworthy world, where users can speak more frankly. As trust in groups grows, so it is withdrawn from public institutions and officials. A new common sense develops, founded on instinctive suspicion towards the world beyond the group.The ongoing rise of WhatsApp, and its challenge to both legacy institutions and open social media, poses a profound political question: how do public institutions and discussions retain legitimacy and trust once people are organised into closed and invisible communities? The risk is that a vicious circle ensues, in which private groups circulate ever more information and disinformation to discredit public officials and public information, and our alienation from democracy escalates.The features that would later allow WhatsApp to become a conduit for conspiracy theory and political conflict were ones never integral to SMS, and have more in common with email: the creation of groups and the ability to forward messages. The ability to forward messages from one group to another – recently limited in response to Covid-19-related misinformation – makes for a potent informational weapon. Groups were initially limited in size to 100 people, but this was later increased to 256. That’s small enough to feel exclusive, but if 256 people forward a message on to another 256 people, 65,536 will have received it.Groups originate for all sorts of purposes – a party, organising amateur sport, a shared interest – but then take on a life of their own. There can be an anarchic playfulness about this, as a group takes on its own set of in-jokes and traditions. In a New York Magazine piece last year, under the headline “Group chats are making the internet fun again”, the technology critic Max Read argued that groups have become “an outright replacement for the defining mode of social organization of the past decade: the platform-centric, feed-based social network.”It’s understandable that in order to relax, users need to know they’re not being overheard – though there is a less playful side to this. If groups are perceived as a place to say what you really think, away from the constraints of public judgement or “political correctness”, then it follows that they are also where people turn to share prejudices or more hateful expressions, that are unacceptable (or even illegal) elsewhere. Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Spanish far-right party Vox, has defined his party as one willing to “defend what Spaniards say on WhatsApp”.A different type of group emerges where its members are all users of the same service, such as a school, a housing block or a training programme. A potential problem here is one of negative solidarity, in which feelings of community are deepened by turning against the service in question. Groups of this sort typically start from a desire to pool information – students staying in touch about deadlines, say – but can swiftly become a means of discrediting the institution they cluster around. Initial murmurs of dissatisfaction can escalate rapidly, until the group has forged an identity around a spirit of resentment and alienation, which can then be impossible to dislodge with countervailing evidence.Faced with the rise of new technologies, one option for formal organisations and associations is to follow people to their preferred platform. In March, the government introduced a WhatsApp-based information service about Covid-19, with an automated chatbot. But groups themselves can be an unreliable means of getting crucial information to people. Anecdotal evidence from local political organisers and trade union reps suggests that, despite the initial efficiency of WhatsApp groups, their workload often increases because of the escalating number of sub-communities, each of which needs to be contacted separately. Schools desperately seek to get information out to parents, only to discover that unless it appears in precisely the right WhatsApp group, it doesn’t register. The age of the message board, be it physical or digital, where information can be posted once for anyone who needs it, is over.WhatsApp’s ‘broadcast list’ function, which allows messages to be sent to multiple recipients who are invisible to one another (like email’s ‘bcc’ line), alleviates some of the problems of groups taking on a life of their own. But even then, lists can only include people who are already mutual contacts of the list-owner. The problem, from the point of view of institutions, is that WhatsApp use seems fuelled by a preference for informal, private communication as such. University lecturers are frequently baffled by the discovery that many students and applicants don’t read email. If email is going into decline, WhatsApp does not seem to be a viable alternative when it comes to sharing verified information as widely and inclusively as possible.Groups are great for brief bursts of humour or frustration, but, by their very nature, far less useful for supporting the circulation of public information. To understand why this is the case, we have to think about the way in which iniduals can become swayed and influenced once they belong to a group.The internet has brought with it its own litany of social pathologies and threats. Trolling, flaming, doxing, cancelling and pile-ons are all risks that go with socialising within a vast open architecture. “Open” platforms such as Twitter are reminders that much social activity tends to be aimed at a small and select community, but can be rendered comical or shameful when exposed to a different community altogether.As any frequent user of WhatsApp or a closed Facebook group will recognise, the moral anxiety associated with groups is rather different. If the worry in an open network is of being judged by some outside observer, be it one’s boss or an extended family member, in a closed group it is of saying something that goes against the codes that anchor the group’s identity. Groups can rapidly become dominated by a certain tone or worldview that is uncomfortable to challenge and nigh-impossible to dislodge. WhatsApp is a machine for generating feelings of faux pas, as comments linger in a group’s feed, waiting for a response.This means that while groups can generate high levels of solidarity, which can in principle be put to powerful political effect, it also becomes harder to express disagreement within the group. If, for example, an outspoken and popular member of a neighbourhood WhatsApp group begins to circulate misinformation about health risks, the general urge to maintain solidarity means that their messages are likely to be met with approval and thanks. When a claim or piece of content shows up in a group, there may be many members who view it as dubious the question is whether they have the confidence to say as much. Meanwhile, the less sceptical can simply forward it on. It’s not hard, then, to understand why WhatsApp is a powerful distributor of “fake news” and conspiracy theories.As on open social platforms, one of the chief ways of building solidarity on WhatsApp is to posit some injustice or enemy that threatens the group and its members. In the most acute examples, conspiracy theories are unleashed against political opponents, to the effect that they are paedophiles or secret affiliates of foreign powers. Such plausibly deniable practices swirled around the fringes of the successful election campaigns of Modi, Bolsonaro and Donald Trump, and across multiple platforms.But what makes WhatsApp potentially more dangerous than public social media are the higher levels of trust and honesty that are often present in private groups. It is a truism that nobody is as happy as they appear on Facebook, as attractive as they appear on Instagram or as angry as they appear on Twitter, which spawns a growing weariness with such endless performance. By contrast, closed groups are where people take off their public masks and let their critical guard down. Neither anonymity (a precondition of most trolling) nor celebrity are on offer. The speed with which rumours circulate on WhatsApp is partly a reflection of how altruistic and uncritical people can be in groups. Most of the time, people seem to share false theories about Covid-19 not with the intention of doing harm, but precisely out of concern for other group members. Anti-vaxx, anti-5G or anti-Hillary rumours combine an identification of an enemy with a strong internal sense of solidarity. Nevertheless, they add to the sense that the world is hostile and dangerous.There is one particular pattern of a group chat that can manufacture threats and injustices out of thin air. It tends to start with one participant speculating that they are being let down or targeted by some institution or rival group – be it a public service, business or cultural community – whereupon a second participant agrees. By this stage, it becomes risky for anyone else to defend the institution or group in question, and immediately a new enemy and a new resentment is born. Instantly, the warnings and denunciations emanating from within the group take on a level of authenticity that cannot be matched by the entity that is now the object of derision.But what if the first contributor has misunderstood or misread something, or had a very stressful day and needs to let off steam? And what if the second is merely agreeing so as to make the first one feel better? And what if the other members are either too distracted, too inhibited or too exhausted to say anything to oppose this fresh indignation? This needn’t snowball into the forms of conspiracy theory that produce riots or arson attacks. But even in milder forms, it makes the job of communicating official information – occasionally life-saving information – far more troublesome than it was just a decade ago. Information about public services and health risks is increasingly having to penetrate a thicket of overlapping groups, many of which may have developed an instinctive scepticism to anything emanating from the “mainstream”.Part of the challenge for institutions is that there is often a strange emotional comfort in the shared feeling of alienation and passivity. “We were never informed about that”, “nobody consulted us”, “we are being ignored”. These are dominant expressions of our political zeitgeist. As WhatsApp has become an increasingly common way of encountering information and news, a vicious circle can ensue: the public world seems ever more distant, impersonal and fake, and the private group becomes a space of sympathy and authenticity.This is a new twist in the evolution of the social internet. Since the 90s, the internet has held out a promise of connectivity, openness and inclusion, only to then confront inevitable threats to privacy, security and identity. By contrast, groups make people feel secure and anchored, but also help to fragment civil society into separate cliques, unknown to one another. This is the outcome of more than 20 years of ideological battles over what sort of social space the internet should be.For a few years at the dawn of the millennium, the O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conferences (or ETech), were a crucible in which a new digital world was imagined and debated. Launched by the west coast media entrepreneur Tim O’Reilly and hosted annually around California, the conferences attracted a mixture of geeks, gurus, designers and entrepreneurs, brought together more in a spirit of curiosity than of commerce. In 2005, O’Reilly coined the term “web 2.0” to describe a new wave of websites that connected users with each other, rather than with existing offline institutions. Later that year, the domain name facebook was purchased by a 21-year-old Harvard student, and the age of the giant social media platforms was born.Within this short window of time, we can see competing ideas of what a desirable online community might look like. The more idealistic tech gurus who attended ETech insisted that the internet should remain an open public space, albeit one in which select communities could cluster for their own particular purposes, such as creating open-source software projects or Wikipedia entries. The untapped potential of the internet, they believed, was for greater democracy. But for companies such as Facebook, the internet presented an opportunity to collect data about users en masse. The internet’s potential was for greater surveillance. The rise of the giant platforms from 2005 onwards suggested the latter view had won out. And yet, in a strange twist, we are now witnessing a revival of anarchic, self-organising digital groups – only now, in the hands of Facebook as well. The two competing visions have collided.To see how this story unfolded, it’s worth going back to 2003. At the ETech conference that year, a keynote speech was given by the web enthusiast and writer Clay Shirky, now an academic at New York University, which surprised its audience by declaring that the task of designing successful online communities had little to do with technology at all. The talk looked back at one of the most fertile periods in the history of social psychology, and was entitled “A group is its own worst enemy”.Shirky drew on the work of the British psychoanalyst and psychologist Wilfred Bion, who, together with Kurt Lewin, was one of the pioneers of the study of “group dynamics” in the 40s. The central proposition of this school was that groups possess psychological properties that exist independently of their inidual members. In groups, people find themselves behaving in ways that they never would if left to their own devices.Like Stanley Milgram’s notorious series of experiments to test obedience in the early 60s – in which some participants were persuaded to administer apparently painful electric shocks to others – the mid-20th century concern with group dynamics grew in the shadow of the political horrors of the 30s and 40s, which had posed grave questions about how iniduals come to abandon their ordinary sense of morality. Lewin and Bion posited that groups possess distinctive personalities, which emerge organically through the interaction of their members, independently of what rules they might have been given, or what iniduals might rationally do alone.With the dawn of the 60s, and its more inidualistic political hopes, psychologists’ interest in groups started to wane. The assumption that iniduals are governed by conformity fell by the wayside. When Shirky introduced Bion’s work at the O’Reilly conference in 2003, he was going out on a limb. What he correctly saw was that, in the absence of any explicit structures or rules, online communities were battling against many of the disruptive dynamics that fascinated the psychologists of the 40s.Shirky highlighted one area of Bion’s work in particular: how groups can spontaneously sabotage their own stipulated purpose. The beauty of early online communities, such as listservs, message boards and wikis, was their spirit of egalitarianism, humour and informality. But these same properties often worked against them when it came to actually getting anything constructive done, and could sometimes snowball into something obstructive or angry. Once the mood of a group was erted towards jokes, disruption or hostility towards another group, it became very difficult to wrest it back.Bion’s concerns originated in fear of humanity’s darker impulses, but the vision Shirky was putting to his audience that day was a more optimistic one. If the designers of online spaces could preempt disruptive “group dynamics”, he argued, then it might be possible to support cohesive, productive online communities that remained open and useful at the same time. Like a well designed park or street, a well-designed online space might nurture healthy sociability without the need for policing, surveillance or closure to outsiders. Between one extreme of anarchic chaos (constant trolling), and another of strict moderation and regulation of discussion (acceding to an authority figure), thinking in terms of group dynamics held out the promise of a social web that was still largely self-organising, but also relatively orderly.But there was another solution to this same problem waiting in the wings, which would turn out to be world-changing in its consequences: forget group dynamics, and focus on reputation dynamics instead. If someone online has a certain set of offline attributes, such as a job title, an album of tagged photos, a list of friends and an email address, they will behave themselves in ways that are appropriate to all of these fixed public identifiers. Add more and more surveillance into the mix, both by one’s peers and by corporations, and the problem of spontaneous group dynamics disappears. It is easier to hold on to your self-control and your conscience if you are publicly visible, including to friends, extended family and colleagues.For many of the Californian pioneers of cyberculture, who cherished online communities as an escape from the values and constraints of capitalist society, Zuckerberg’s triumph represents an unmitigated defeat. Corporations were never meant to seize control of this space. As late as 2005, the hope was that the social web would be built around democratic principles and bottom-up communities. Facebook abandoned all of that, by simply turning the internet into a multimedia telephone directory.The last ETech was held in 2009. Within a decade, Facebook was being accused of pushing liberal democracy to the brink and even destroying truth itself. But as the demands of social media have become more onerous, with each of us curating a profile and projecting an identity, the lure of the autonomous group has resurfaced once again. In some respects, Shirky’s optimistic concern has now become today’s pessimistic one. Partly thanks to WhatsApp, the unmoderated, self-governing, amoral collective – larger than a conversation, smaller than a public – has become a dominant and disruptive political force in our society, much as figures such as Bion and Lewin feared.Conspiracy theories and paranoid group dynamics were features of political life long before WhatsApp arrived. It makes no sense to blame the app for their existence, any more than it makes sense to blame Facebook for Brexit. But by considering the types of behaviour and social structures that technologies enable and enhance, we get a better sense of some of society’s characteristics and ailments. What are the general tendencies that WhatsApp helps to accelerate?First of all, there is the problem of conspiracies in general. WhatsApp is certainly an unbeatable conduit for circulating conspiracy theories, but we must also admit that it seems to be an excellent tool for facilitating genuinely conspiratorial behaviour. One of the great difficulties when considering conspiracy theories in today’s world is that, regardless of WhatsApp, some conspiracies turn out to be true: consider Libor-fixing, phone-hacking, or efforts by Labour party officials to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s electoral prospects. These all happened, but one would have sounded like a conspiracy theorist to suggest them until they were later confirmed by evidence.A communication medium that connects groups of up to 256 people, without any public visibility, operating via the phones in their pockets, is by its very nature, well-suited to supporting secrecy. Obviously not every group chat counts as a “conspiracy”. But it makes the question of how society coheres, who is associated with whom, into a matter of speculation – something that involves a trace of conspiracy theory. In that sense, WhatsApp is not just a channel for the circulation of conspiracy theories, but offers content for them as well. The medium is the message.The full political potential of WhatsApp has not been witnessed in the UK. To date, it has not served as an effective political campaigning tool, partly because users seem reluctant to join large groups with people they don’t know. However, the influence – imagined or real – of WhatsApp groups within Westminster and the media undoubtedly contributes to the deepening sense that public life is a sham, behind which lurk invisible networks through which power is coordinated. WhatsApp has become a kind of “backstage” of public life, where it is assumed people articulate what they really think and believe in secret. This is a sensibility that has long fuelled conspiracy theories, especially antisemitic ones. Invisible WhatsApp groups now offer a modern update to the type of “explanation” that once revolved around Masonic lodges or the Rothschilds.Away from the world of party politics and news media, there is the prospect of a society organised as a tapestry of overlapping cliques, each with their own internal norms. Groups are less likely to encourage heterodoxy or risk-taking, and more likely to inculcate conformity, albeit often to a set of norms hostile to those of the “mainstream”, whether that be the media, politics or professional public servants simply doing their jobs. In the safety of the group, it becomes possible to have one’s cake and eat it, to be simultaneously radical and orthodox, hyper-sceptical and yet unreflective.For all the benefits that WhatsApp offers in helping people feel close to others, its rapid ascendency is one further sign of how a common public world – based upon verified facts and recognised procedures – is disintegrating. WhatsApp is well equipped to support communications on the margins of institutions and public discussion: backbenchers plotting coups, parents gossipping about teachers, friends sharing edgy memes, journalists circulating rumours, family members forwarding on unofficial medical advice. A society that only speaks honestly on the margins like this will find it harder to sustain the legitimacy of experts, officials and representatives who, by definition, operate in the spotlight. Meanwhile, distrust, alienation and conspiracy theories become the norm, chipping away at the institutions that might hold us together. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33ad00411039588c31265caee61df9958e97999/0_41_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b677b8909da8ccc9b9232635f4db4d73","title":"10 of the best uk campsites readers travel tips","story":"Combining open air with social distancing, a stay at a UK campsite will be a popular option this year.

The comic and TV presenter began to hyperventilate and cry behind his goggles. “I can’t do it,” he pleaded repeatedly as he thrashed around. “I felt extremely disabled for the first time in as long as I can remember because my body just wasn’t doing what I wanted it to,” he says over the phone from his home in London.As has become the norm for Brooker, the entire ordeal was captured on camera and televised as part of Channel 4’s charity reality show Sink Or Swim. Brooker was born with hand and arm deformities, and became a leg amputee at 13 months old. He rose to prominence with self-deprecating takes on his disability during the Friday night topical chatshow The Last Leg, which began as part of Channel 4’s coverage of the Paralympics in London. He is one of the few disabled faces regularly seen on British TV, but it has only been over the past year that he decided to confront his disability without the jokes, leading to a new documentary on BBC Two this Sunday.“Most days I don’t think about my disability at all, but doing that swim brought it clearly into focus,” he says. “It made me realise it was time now, as a father of two, to take more responsibility over my disability and to find out more about it.” Despite a childhood spent having multiple operations and checkups at Great Ormond Street hospital, Brooker had not been to see a doctor for 17 years before the documentary was filmed. “I’d been having this pain in my left leg for the longest time, but I was too scared to go to the doctor in case it was bad news,” he says. “When my wife was pregnant, I remember going to the scans and these doctors would be checking that my child wouldn’t be deformed like me – even though my disability isn’t genetic – and that makes you so self-conscious of everything. I would be worrying I might drop the kids or how they would react to me being different.”One of the most emotional and frank parts of the film is when Brooker meets Lee, a fellow Arsenal supporter and recent paraplegic, and the pair talk of their concerns about being disabled dads.“Disabled people all get lumped together under the umbrella term of disability, but of course we’re all different,” he says. “There’s a big difference between me being an amputee from when I was 13 months old to someone who’s lost their leg in an accident. I don’t know the pain associated with losing a limb and I don’t know the rehab. So meeting Lee and listening to how his life changed completely was so emotional. I took a lot from that. He said to me: ‘You’ll always be the dad to your kids, you’ll never be anything different whether you’re disabled or not,’ and I got very emotional then because I’ve never had that conversation. I’ve never told anyone because it’s really scared the shit out of me.”In fact, Brooker’s eldest daughter recently noticed his disability for the first time. “It was a moment I’ve worried about all my life,” he says. “What if my kids are scared of me? But my daughter was holding my hand and just said: ‘Oh, you’ve got two fingers haven’t you and I’ve got four,’ and that was it. It was all done and dusted in five seconds. I thought to myself: ‘I’ve been worrying about this for 25 years, you could have made a bit more out of it!’ She’s three now and she’s been able to count above two for a while, so really I was looking at this as a marker of her progress in mathematics as well.”Making light of difficult situations is a hallmark of Brooker’s comedy and something he believes empowers him. “Self-deprecating humour is a common form of comedy and it helps get the audience on side because you’re being vulnerable,” he says. “Being able to joke about my disability also gives me some control over it. My disability makes me emotional, but it also makes me laugh the two are not mutually exclusive and I’m comfortable doing both. Joking about it can be a celebration of it, too.”Brooker got his start on television after he sent in an audition tape to be a presenter for Channel 4’s 2012 Paralympics coverage. “After a while, I stopped being the guy with the hands to just the guy on telly and desensitising people to that was a really big hurdle. The more disabled people there are on screen, the more likely that is to have a bigger impact in society,” he says. “There’s still obviously nowhere near the representation of disabled people that there should be, but progress is happening slowly. It’s a much better landscape from when I first started.”Ultimately, Brooker hopes his documentary will help shine a light not only on his experiences but on the all-too-common difficulties faced by disabled people in the UK. “We filmed this last year before the lockdown and what I think the lockdown has shown is that not being able to leave the house can be a daily occurrence for disabled people, no matter the state of the outside world,” he says. “I hope it will make people more empathetic to our experiences and for disabled people to understand that talking about our difficulties can really help us not be afraid of who we are.”Is he worried about showing such a raw, emotional side to himself? “It was a tough process, but I don’t see that emotion as a negative I’ve cried on telly loads now and it’s cathartic,” he says. “Disabled people don’t want to complain, they just want a fair crack at the best chance to live. You’ve already got restrictions in your own bodies, so you don’t need it when you leave the house in the morning, too.”Alex Brooker: Disability and Me is on BBC Two on 5 July at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd093f9f860eef3c69ac6426af3784dfd0fc02f/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=255cbec0dc2d3be3c654ce805b9bfaa6","title":"china muslim labor camps uighur hair products","story":"Border officials say shipment contained 13 tons of weaves and other hair products worth $800,000US federal authorities have seized a shipment of products made from human hair believed to have been taken from Muslims in labor camps in China’s western Xinjiang province.Customs and Border Protection officials said that 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes) of weaves and other hair products worth an estimated $800,000 were in the shipment.“The production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the United States that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in US supply chains,” said Brenda Smith, executive assistant commissioner of CBP’s office of trade.This is the second time this year that CBP has slapped a rare detention order on shipments of hair products from China, based on suspicions that people making them face human rights abuses.Rushan Abbas, a Uighur American activist whose sister went missing in China almost two years ago and is believed to be locked in a detention camp, said women who use hair weaves should think about who might be making them.“This is so heartbreaking for us,” she said. “I want people to think about the slavery people are experiencing today. My sister is sitting somewhere being forced to make what, hair pieces?”Wednesday’s shipment was made by Lop County Meixin Hair Product Co Ltd. In May, a similar detention was placed on Hetian Haolin Hair Accessories Co Ltd, although those weaves were synthetic, not human, the agency said. Both of the exporters are in China’s far west Xinjiang region, where, over the past four years, the government has detained an estimated 1 million or more ethnic Turkic minorities.Detainees are held in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological discipline, forced to denounce their religion and language and physically abused. China has long suspected the Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.Reports by the AP and other news organizations have repeatedly found that people inside the internment camps and prisons, which activists call “black factories”, are making sportswear and other clothing for popular US brands.The Chinese ministry of affairs has said there is no forced labor, nor detention of ethnic minorities.Xinjiang authorities announced in December that the camps had closed and all the detainees had “graduated”, a claim difficult to corroborate independently given tight surveillance and restrictions on reporting in the region.Some Uighurs and Kazakhs have told the AP that their relatives have been released, but many others say their loved ones remain in detention, were sentenced to prison or were transferred to forced labor in factories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d5ccccc1d87c0e13a6cfb1158a8d61a358bf261/0_48_2885_1731/master/2885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591bb57dc325cbd4b7c29a2e1c0a13a3","title":"data reveals coronavirus hotspots in bradford barnsley and rochdale","story":"Exclusive: figures reveal locations with highest levels of new infections after LeicesterBradford, Barnsley and Rochdale can be revealed as the places with the highest levels of new Covid-19 infections after Leicester, as fears grow of further local outbreaks and the UK heads towards Saturday’s lifting of more lockdown restrictions.The official data, which has not been previously published on Public Health England’s online dashboard, comes amid complaints from local health officials and medics that a lack of detailed testing about local outbreaks is causing delays in attempts to curtail them.It also raises fresh questions about the disproportionate impact of the virus on ethnic minorities, with seven out of 10 of the worst affected areas being in Yorkshire and Lancashire, including some of the most ethnically erse parts of the country.Leicester was locked down on Monday after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country. Figures from Public Health England now show that rate was even higher in the east Midlands city – just over 140 – in the week ending the previous Sunday, 21 June.Bradford’s rate for that week was 69.4 per 100,000 people, Barnsley’s 54.7 and Rochdale’s 53.6, according to the official figures, which gather together both tests primarily in NHS settings and of healthcare workers and tests carried out in people’s homes and in the community.The two strands are known as pillar-one and pillar-two testing.However, only the pillar-one testing is used in PHE’s online coronavirus dashboard, meaning that the majority of cases in the worst-hit areas are being left off this data. This data did not show that as far back as the week beginning 1 June, PHE knew Leicester was among the two worst affected areas in England.The Leicester MP Liz Kendall said it took “far too long to get even very basic postcode data, which is what we need to identify where the problem is whether it is in schools, whether it is in certain factories and workplaces. You really do need that detail.”Local public health officials and medics have complained that the government has not supplied sufficiently detailed information on local infections, the lack of which they say hampers attempts to quash new outbreaks.Councils have been promised postcode-level data for weeks from Public Health England and the newly created Joint Biosecurity Centre. But some public health directors are concerned the centre has not been sharing data about potential clusters of infections with councils, which could enforce school or workplace closures that could suppress an outbreak at an early stage.“If the only data you’re getting is ‘in this population of 90,000 people there are 40 positives’ it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. If Leicester had got the data sooner they could have had a fighting chance of managing it,” said one public health director, who asked not to be named.The British Medical Association also implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the BMA Council, said on Wednesday: “The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground – be they public health teams or local leaders – are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible. This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now. This is all the more important given that the ‘world-leading’ test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.”The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has been “working closely with our local partners, providing them with the resources and tools so that they can take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection”.In total, there are 47 English local authorities where there are more than 10 cases per 100,000. In a further sign that the disease has shifted away from the capital, not one of these 47 areas was in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d2e186b1a479446a47f76e82355972831bd4e1/0_334_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d40b3bf4629edb94cf28b9198d0162d7","title":"data that could stop new covid 19 waves in england being withheld say councils","story":"Exclusive: local leaders say they are not getting test results needed to prevent flare-upsCrucial data that could help prevent fresh local waves of coronavirus is being withheld from some of the places most in danger of further lockdowns, the  has been told.Council leaders said on Wednesday they were either not getting test results needed to prevent new outbreaks, or the results were incomplete and without sufficient detail to allow them to quell local surges in infection.The complaints came as Labour accused Boris Johnson of presiding over “a lost week” which has let the virus spread, threatening fresh lockdowns as physical distancing restrictions are loosened this weekend. The government hit back, claiming councils had the information they needed to keep the virus at bay.Rochdale borough council, which has one of the highest levels of new infections in England after Leicester, told the  the borough had not received any community testing results – known as pillar-two tests. The council leader, Steve Rumbelow, warned the data showing who had tested positive outside of healthcare settings was essential “to ensure that Rochdale does not get to where Leicester is now.”That appeared to contradict the prime minister’s claim in parliament that all test results – community testing in pillar two and NHS testing in pillar one – “have been shared not just with Leicester but with all authorities across the country”.The pillar-two results, which were published in full for the first time by Public Health England (PHE) on Wednesday, have shown many more positive tests than those taken in hospitals and so provide a very different picture of where infection rates are moving towards dangerous levels.Labour said it was not until last Thursday that Leicester city council was told that while pillar-one tests showed 80 positive tests in the last fortnight, the real figure was 944 and within days the city was locked down.Barnsley, which after Leicester had the highest levels of infections recently alongside Bradford and Rochdale, only started getting community postcode-level testing data on Wednesday this week.The information is essential to help local officials intervene in local outbreaks. On Monday they started arriving at Bradford city council and at Cheshire West and Chester, whose council leader, Louise Gittins, complained they were “incomplete, poor quality and difficult to access”. The test results were not always linked to a postcode, age, occupation or ethnic minority data, she said.Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, also complained the community data included no information about ethnicity, age, occupation, gender or, crucially, postcode of the infected person.“If you have 10 cases and they are spread out across Wigan, that is one thing,” he said. “If they are all in the same street that’s another thing entirely. We are promised this data. It is the most important piece of data we still need.”A government source responded that local directors of public health had been offered postcode level data 10 days ago.“Leicester did not reply for two days, until Wednesday 24 June,” said the source. “Upon hearing from Leicester, we immediately confirmed and issued the datasharing agreement to them.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Rochdale council has not returned PHE’s data agreement, which is why they have not received the data yet, despite PHE sending it to them twice.”The data has been collected by PHE since at least the beginning of June, but only the pillar one data was used on its online Coronavirus dashboard.Local officials are now working hard to apply the data that is coming through and avoid following Leicester into second lockdowns. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London – who quit as a government adviser after admitting breaking lockdown rules – warned on Wednesday the UK should be braced for “inevitable” regional flare-ups.PHE’s community testing data up to 21 June showed that Bradford, Barnsley and Rochdale had the highest levels of new Covid-19 infections after Leicester.It raises fresh questions about the disproportionate impact of the virus on ethnic minorities.Leicester was locked down on Monday after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country.Bradford’s rate for the week to 21 June week was 69.4 per 100,000 people, Barnsley’s 54.7 and Rochdale’s 53.6, according to the official figures. More up-to-date figures for Rochdale for the week ending 30 June show infections had dropped to 28.8.A PHE “rapid investigation team” report into the outbreak in Leicester published on Wednesday evening showed that of the 3,216 cases in the city, almost a third, 944 came in the last 14 days. The infection rate recorded in the community was more than four times higher than the average for England.Leicester MP Liz Kendall said it took “far too long to get even very basic postcode data, which is what we need to identify where the problem is whether it is in schools, whether it is in certain factories and workplaces. You really do need that detail.”The British Medical Association also implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the BMA Council, said on Wednesday: “The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground – be they public health teams or local leaders – are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible.

Astra Zeneca, the company that has partnered with Oxford, is to start a trial with 30,000 people in the US.Bingham said Gilbert’s team was a long way ahead of the field. “The Oxford study will have likely vaccinated all their efficacy subjects before any of the other vaccines actually start their big efficacy trials. So that just gives you a scale of how far ahead they are versus the other companies,” she said.Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, criticised the lack of pandemic planning in the UK and particularly the absence of manufacturing capacity for vaccines.“I don’t think we had particularly confident or extensive planning for any pandemic, to be honest,” he told the committee. “People occasionally talked about flu but very little was done. I think we weren’t really ready for a pandemic in the UK. And I think that’s something that we need to pay very close attention to.”The UK had shown its ability to be ahead of the rest of the world in scientific research and clinical trials for vaccines, he said.“So I think we have to go back and think about how our healthcare system and our public health system thinks much more strategically about how we get ready for pandemics, rather than try to react after they’ve arrived on the doorstep, because I think that’s where the problem was.”Bell said the UK was “pretty complacent” about its manufacturing capacity for vaccines before the pandemic.“Our vaccine manufacturing capability was allowed to drift and was pretty lamentable at the beginning of this,” he said. “You don’t want to rely on importing vaccine from the US because you’re not going to get it at this stage.”This pandemic was “not a one-off” that would not recur for centuries, he said.“Since 2000 we’ve had eight close calls, which should have made us wake up. We’ve had three flu epidemics or near-flu epidemics, two Sars episodes, one Mers episode, Zika and Ebola, and any one of those could have blown up to be exactly what we’ve got now, so this needs become part of our national health security infrastructure.”He said it would be important to immunise as many vulnerable and older people as possible against flu before the winter. At the moment Australia, which usually experiences first the strains of flu the UK can expect, is not having a bad season.“But then there are these reports coming out of China about a new flu strain, which is a swine flu strain, which always worry you, because many of these strains do emerge out of China,” Bell said.“Whatever happens is likely to happen through the autumn, getting into the winter, and we’ll have a whole new set of other respiratory viruses floating around and if we happen to have a bad flu season, it will cause lots of trouble and there will be a real challenge, you know doing diagnostics separating the flu from the Covid patients doing all that kind of stuff. So, so we need to be on the front foot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e005430ca657e98e3ced8629c5929766e302bb9d/0_60_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f50e6a77ca46bcf9cdd053959b983f7","title":"china could prevent hongkongers moving to uk says dominic raab","story":"Beijing says Britain will ‘bear all consequences’ of helping fleeing Hongkongers China has said it will take countermeasures against the UK should it grant residency to Hongkongers fleeing a harsh new national security law, promising that the UK would “bear all consequences”.On Thursday, senior Chinese officials said the UK had no right to give residency to Hongkongers in response to Beijing forcing a sweeping anti-sedition law on the territory.“China strongly condemns this and reserves the right to take further measures. The British side will bear all the consequences,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing in Beijing.Zhao’s comments came after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he would honour a promise to offer nearly 3 million residents of the former British colony, those with British national overseas status (BNO), the right to settle in the UK.Earlier on Thursday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, also said any move to grant residency to BNO holders would be a violation of agreements between the two countries.It was clear that “all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, whether or not they are holders of the British dependent territories citizens passport or the British national (overseas) passport”, he said.“If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law.“We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,” he said in a statement posted on the embassy’s website on Thursday. “The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ‘supervision’ over Hong Kong.”Since the Hong Kong law went into effect late on Tuesday, at least 10 people have been arrested on national security related charges, including a 15-year old girl who waved a Hong Kong independence flag. On Wednesday, a total of almost 400 people were detained on other charges such as unlawful assembly, as thousands protested against the law.Human rights advocates and residents, fearing the security legislation will be used to arrest protesters and pro-democracy activists, have called on countries to allow Hongkongers to seek refuge in their countries.On Thursday, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said his country was working on a scheme to provide a safe haven to Hong Kong residents after China’s “very concerning” decision. Morrison said Australia was “prepared to step up and provide support”, although his cabinet was yet to finalise the details, including whether the scheme would include a pathway to permanent settlement.The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has admitted there is little Britain can do to “coercively force” China if it tries to block Hongkongers from coming to the UK.He told ITV’s Peston programme on Wednesday: “Ultimately if they follow through on something like that there would be little that we could do to coercively force them.”Raab continued: “There is an issue around freedom and human rights in Hong Kong, and there is an issue around China keeping its word on an international obligation it made to the United Kingdom back in 1984.“I wouldn’t want to be naive about this I think we need to be realistic. But I do think that China as a rising, leading member of the international community is sensitive to the reputational risk in all of this, but clearly not sufficiently that it hasn’t proceeded anyway ... There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about.“But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn’t be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.”Raab said he was working with other countries in the region to discuss a lifeboat operation. He said: “We think the majority will probably hunker down in Hong Kong, and others would leave to other countries in the region.”The UK government believes the new security legislation passed by Beijing breaches the Sino-British joint declaration, which aimed to smooth the transition when the territory was handed back to China in 1997.Johnson has said he will honour a promise to change immigration rules to allow holders of BNO passports, as well as those eligible for the passport, to reside in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship.As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the government estimated there were around 2.9 million BNOs living in Hong Kong.China has argued that a memorandum attached to the Sino-British joint declaration does not grant right of abode to those eligible for BNO status, but legal experts say the UK is not barred from extending their rights.Downing Street said those with BNO status would be eligible to travel to the UK immediately before the details of the scheme were finalised “in the coming weeks” and that they would not face salary thresholds.The security law in Hong Kong, enacted late after an opaque legislative process that took less than six weeks, criminalises a broad swathe of behaviours deemed as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Critics say the law gives authorities sweeping new powers to crack down on dissent and a new level of Chinese control over the semi-autonomous territory.Liu was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday, where the permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told him the imposition of the new legislation on Hong Kong breached the Sino-British joint declaration.Following his visit, Liu tweeted: “After turbulent months in the latter half of last year, the national security law will bring the order＆stability to Hong Kong and get its economy back on track.”China views its actions as one of the last steps towards decolonisation, but an early test of its willingness to preserve the country’s freedoms will come in the autumn elections for the legislature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0043e0529f70cd2a47e34c41e53f00369222fd40/0_181_4129_2478/master/4129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7524949c1ccb206767316cb117c1e12b","title":"china sanctions approved by us house as pelosi calls hong kong security law horrific","story":" Bill could go before Donald Trump as early as Thursday, amid calls for a strong action against China over Hong Kong crackdownThe US House of Representatives on Wednesday joined the Senate in approving a bill to rebuke China over its crackdown in Hong Kong by imposing sanctions on groups that undermine the city’s autonomy or restrict its freedoms.The bill targets police units that have cracked down on Hong Kong protesters, as well as Chinese Communist party officials responsible for imposing a strict “national security” law on Hong Kong, which is considered a special administrative region within China and maintains its own governing and economic systems.The measure also would impose sanctions on banks that do business with entities found to violate the law.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the unanimous House vote “an urgently needed response to the cowardly Chinese government’s passage of its so-called ‘national security’ law, which threatens the end of the ‘one country, two systems’ promised exactly 23 years ago today.”Pelosi, a fierce critic of Chinese human rights violations, said: “All freedom-loving people must condemn this horrific law” imposed by China, adding that it was specifically intended to “dismantle democratic freedoms in Hong Kong”.The House bill is similar to a measure approved last week in the Senate, but makes some minor changes. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, said senators will vote as soon as Thursday to give final legislative approval, sending it to the White House.Lawmakers from both parties have urged the Trump administration to take strong action in response to the crackdown by China against the former British territory, which was granted partial sovereignty under a treaty that took effect on 1 July 1997.China has said it will impose visa restrictions on Americans it sees as interfering over Hong Kong.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the threat of a visa ban as a sign of “how Beijing refuses to take responsibility for its own choices” and said adoption of the security law “destroys the territory’s autonomy and one of China’s greatest achievements”.Beijing’s “paranoia and fear of its own people’s aspirations have led it to eviscerate the very foundation of the territory’s success,” Pompeo said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52fcb5b36c470950d14579ebcad0278678b6a02/0_12_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215e33a4f91962ee76cf6b407f06f926","title":"david clarks resignation inevitable as ardern seeks to restore trust","story":"New Zealand’s handling of coronavirus was besmirched by health minister’s blunders, so a pre-election salvage operation was neededNew Zealanders had been confined to their homes for more than two weeks when photographs emerged of David Clark’s campaign van parked at a mountain-biking track in Dunedin.His vehicle was the only one there.The health minister had flouted lockdown rules to hit the tracks at Signal Hill, angering the general public who by and large were adhering to the strict guidelines to stay at home and only take exercise locally.The prime minister chastised Clark and demoted him, but stopped short of stripping him of his portfolio, saying she didn’t want to rock the boat during the crisis.Ten days later when Clark owned up to another lockdown breach – driving his family to a beach 20km from his home – public outrage reached fever pitch, and calls for his resignation became shouts. Clark offered Ardern his resignation, but she refused – a decision for which she is now being criticised by the opposition.“At a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices I’ve let the team down. I’ve been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,” Clark said in a statement at the time.“As the health minister, it’s my responsibility to not only follow the rules but set an example to other New Zealanders.”New Zealand’s efforts to halt coronavirus in its tracks have been praised around the globe. Earlier this month the country effectively eliminated the virus, and infections were kept below 1,500, and fatalities at 22.But New Zealand’s success at containing the virus seems to owe little to the country’s health minister.In early June it was revealed that two British women were released from border quarantine early without being tested. They then proceeded to travel around the North Island – and were eventually found to be positive for Covid-19.The women’s situation wasn’t an isolated incident. A shambolic border quarantine process has seen dozens of people released from hotel quarantine without being tested, and the health ministry then began a frenzied search to track them, contain them, and test.Clark fronted a press conference last week to explain the bungles, but instead of owning up to mistakes, he blamed Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the much-admired director general of health who had guided Kiwis through the lockdown and earned millions of fans.Social media users were horrified on the health official’s behalf. His face had been “heartbreaking”, said one “like kicking a puppy”, said another. “Is Dr Bloomfield OK?” asked a third.The backlash against Clark was immediate, with political commentators calling his conduct “brutal”, and saying he had thrown Bloomfield under a bus.His tenure then began to be seen as a major liability for Ardern’s re-election chances in September, as well as her global credibility as one of the first countries to eliminate the virus.Clark’s resignation – whether it was voluntary or not – was welcomed in New Zealand, with political insiders calling it a critical and necessary step to salvage the government’s reputation in handling the crisis.One political commentator, Neale Jones, said it was an “honourable decision”, while RNZ’s Jane Patterson described it as “inevitable”.“Momentum against Clark had been building,” writes Patterson, saying his lockdown breaches were “a huge embarrassment to the government”.Clark has said he intends to stand for re-election at local and government level. But with his lockdown breaches one of the biggest scandals of New Zealand’s otherwise playbook perfect handling of the pandemic, he will have a hard task winning back the public’s hearts and minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78c18a381a21f7aa2315a0d5978457ddea4a8bfb/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=98a16ea3ee43670a3829a756972bad31","title":"living in hong kong are you thinking about settling in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from those eligible for the right to settle in the UK on whether they are thinking of leaving Hong KongIn response to the UK prime minister offering nearly 3 million residents in Hong Kong the right to settle in the UK, China has said it would take “corresponding measures” to stop it from happening.We would like to hear from people as to whether they are thinking of relocating to the UK or any other country.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

It harms Aotearoa New Zealand’s cultural, scientific and historic heritage and destroys irreplaceable scientific information” said Sage.“The proposals to use regulations under the Wildlife Act to prohibit the sale of the remains of extinct species, with some special exceptions, would remove the financial incentive that leads a few selfish people to vandalise our natural and cultural heritage.”Moa, giant flightless birds which stood up to 3.6 metres tall, were endemic to New Zealand and became extinct about 500 to 600 years ago. When they were first discovered by Europeans they were considered a scientific marvel and kickstarted a global frenzy, as museums competed to acquire specimens.Under New Zealand law it is legal to sell moa bones and eggshells found on private land. There is no requirements for experts to sample or study the bones, or survey the site, as is standard practice in the UK and many other countries. In November last year a private collector in Britain purchased an entire moa skeleton for $34,000.Although it is illegal to sell or collect moa bones from public conservation land, experts and the department of conservation say looters routinely plunder caves and swamps for remains, which in their entirety can fetch between $20,000 and $50,000, or between $70 and $350 per bone.There have been incidents of entire skeletons appearing in European auction houses with suspect or unknown origins, according to a moa expert, Trevor Worthy.Trade Me, New Zealand’s version of eBay, has hosted hundreds of moa bone and egg sales over the past five years, and requires no evidence or documentation from sellers that their bones were collected legally.Concerned museum curators and palaeontologists say bones sold to private collectors are essentially “garbage”, because without the correct handling and storage they will disintegrate in a matter of decades. Richard Holdaway, a palaeontologist, said private sales should be banned. “Moa bones do not belong to iniduals, they belong to the country,” he said. “There are never going to be any more Moa – every bone sold and destroyed is one less than there will ever be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9595f4d92de94e0146aab5ec03ae7251fd3dd562/0_45_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93de4a0e16a65e435157d45ad1349b52","title":"no kissing amsterdams red light district reopens after coronavirus shutdown","story":"Sex workers welcome the chance to earn again but with strict rules about face-to-face contact, hygiene and making clients check for symptomsAmsterdam’s famed red light district has reopened after a long coronavirus shutdown, with sex workers and clients having to observe new rules to prevent infection.The Netherlands ordered all brothels closed in mid-March and had originally planned to keep them shut until September, but recently brought the date forward as Covid-19 cases dropped.Felicia Anna, a 34-year-old Romanian sex worker, said it “felt very good” to be back at work.“During the lockdown, a lot of sex workers ran into financial trouble so we’re very happy that we can finally start our job again,” Anna, chairwoman of the Red Light United trade union, said.She said there were fears that there would be fewer clients, since many of them are tourists and the Netherlands still has a travel ban on many countries.“But I did ask some of my colleagues and so far they said that the work is quite ok.”“I’m totally booked” for Wednesday, added Foxxy, a sex worker and activist at the Prostitution Information Center in Amsterdam, using her professional pseudonym.She “had a little party” when she heard the government’s 24 June announcement that sex work could restart, added Foxxy, who rents a room in a brothel outside the red light district.While less restrictive than other countries, the Netherlands’ “intelligent lockdown” emptied the red neon-lit, street-front windows from which many of Amsterdam’s prostitutes normally beckon customers.Now they are reopening but, as with Dutch hairdressers and masseurs which have already been allowed to resume operations, sex workers are encouraged to verify that their clients do not have Covid-19 symptoms.“Before I make an appointment, I have to check with the client if they’re feeling ok and if they don’t have any of the symptoms, or if any of their housemates has symptoms,” Foxxy said.Other measures include “disinfection and washing the hands, cleaning the sheets after every appointment. Those are the basic needs. But we don’t need to wear any face masks during the playdates, thank God”.She added that “most of us will avoid face to face, so no kissing”.Felicia Anna said that “after the customer leaves the room, we’re going to disinfect everything he might have touched, bed, sink, the toilet if he used the toilet, the doorknobs, everything”.But she said that sex workers were already well versed in hygiene, adding: “We already dealt with much bigger diseases than corona.”Dutch deputy prime minister Hugo de Jonge said on Wednesday that a “new phase in the approach to coronavirus begins” but urged people to remain vigilant.The Netherlands legalised prostitution in 2000 and sex workers have to register with the local chamber of commerce and pay income tax. Around 7,000 now work in Amsterdam, according to official figures.Anna said the red light district would “certainly” be more affected because “a lot of sex workers” who often come from eastern Europe and South America returned to their home countries during the lockdown and are still not allowed to travel back to the Netherlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c51b02524f2fdda2982d2ac8712cb2fae1a3a46/0_215_3222_1933/master/3222.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6672c16228441f5dc7c7ef4de593dffc","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

In a statement she said:Teachers, school leaders, staff, and parents have achieved a huge amount throughout this crisis, and now they desperately need the support of the government. With only three weeks to go before the end of term, there is an enormous amount to prepare: finalising health and safety arrangements, ensuring there is space for children to learn, restructuring the school day and providing reassurance to parents.The government has been asleep at the wheel, but heads and staff cannot be left to do this alone. Labour is calling for a cross-party taskforce to focus urgently on getting the necessary arrangements in place so that all students can return safely in September.The Department of Health and Social Care has published its latest weekly test and trace figures.In Belfast the row about Sinn Féin’s involvement in the funeral of the IRA veteran Bobby Storey, which saw large crowds gathering in apparent breach of physical distancing regulations, is escalating. The DUP and the SDLP have both said that Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland, should step aside from her role as deputy first minister pending an investigation.The law on these matters is clear and what happened at that funeral has sent out a very, very bad message to people in Northern Ireland.And the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said:Yesterday O’Neill said she was satisfied that her own actions in regard to the funeral were “within the regulations and the public health guidance”.These are from my colleague Peter Walker on the DfE guidance.(Peter has a book coming out next year on the health benefits of physical activity. It sounds terrific.)And the DfE guidance says whole-school closures may not be necessary in England if there are a number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 on site. It says:If schools have two or more confirmed cases within 14 days, or an overall rise in sickness absence where coronavirus (Covid-19) is suspected, they may have an outbreak, and must continue to work with their local health protection team who will be able to advise if additional action is required.In some cases, health protection teams may recommend that a larger number of other pupils self-isolate at home as a precautionary measure – perhaps the whole site or year group. If schools are implementing controls from this list, addressing the risks they have identified and therefore reducing transmission risks, whole school closure based on cases within the school will not generally be necessary, and should not be considered except on the advice of health protection teams.In consultation with the local director of public health, where an outbreak in a school is confirmed, a mobile testing unit may be dispatched to test others who may have been in contact with the person who has tested positive. Testing will first focus on the person’s class, followed by their year group, then the whole school if necessary, in line with routine public health outbreak control practice.Teachers should distance themselves from each other and older students when a full return to school takes place in September, the DfE guidance for all pupils to return to school In England in September says. It says:All teachers and other staff can operate across different classes and year groups in order to facilitate the delivery of the school timetable. This will be particularly important for secondary schools. Where staff need to move between classes and year groups, they should try and keep their distance from pupils and other staff as much as they can, ideally 2 metres from other adults. Again, we recognise this is not likely to be possible with younger children and teachers in primary schools can still work across groups if that is needed to enable a full educational offer.GCSE exams could be delayed next year and more optional questions could be used in test papers under proposals unveiled by England’s exams regulator, PA Media reports. Ofqual has launched a two-week consultation on their plans for the GCSE and A-level exam series in 2021 after students have faced months of school and college closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The watchdog is considering how next year’s exam timetable could be changed to allow more time for teaching - and one of the proposals being looked at is postponing starting GCSE exams until June 7.The Department for Education has released a whole set of documents this morning with guidance relating to coronavirus and education, not just the main document featured earlier. (See 10.09am.) Here is the full set.The news release summarising the plansThe guidance for mainstream schoolsThe guidance for special schools and other specialist settingsThe guidance for early years and childcare providersThe guidance for FE colleges and providersA letter (pdf) from the DfE to Ofqual about plans for exams next year Limits on group sizes will be lifted in nurseries, childminders, and other early years providers from later this month, the Department for Education has said.As PA Media reports, early years providers in England have been able to open more widely to children since 1 June, but there have been restrictions on group sizes. From July 20, these restrictions will be lifted so that providers can increase the number of children they admit from the start of the summer holiday.The NAHT, the union for headteachers, has put out a statement saying that, although it supports the aim of getting all pupils in England back to school in September, it thinks the government also needs a “plan B” in case that is not possible. Here is an extract from the statement from the NAHT general secretary, Paul Whiteman. He says:What is clear is that school will continue to look and feel different for the foreseeable future. This will certainly not represent a return to normality for pupils, parents or staff.Whilst a model of larger group sizes is perhaps the only feasible way to get all pupils back to school on a full-time basis, no-one should underestimate the scale of the challenge school leaders will now face in making these plans work in practice, especially in secondary schools. Significant time will now need to be spent implementing the new measures government is asking schools to take.Throughout the current crisis, school leaders have demonstrated a remarkable ability to transform their schools and adapt to the latest guidance, there is no doubt that they will be able to do so again.Today’s announcement represents government’s plan A for a full return in September. The situation seen in Leicester this week has demonstrated that this crisis is far from over, and there will be further disruption ahead. It is therefore essential that government continues to monitor the data when it comes to school return and that it also has a credible plan B in place should it be required.The Department for Education has just published its guidance for schools in England on how they should open in full from September. The document is here. It starts:It is our plan that all pupils, in all year groups, will return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term.Here is my colleague Sally Weale’s preview story based on the leak of a draft of this document available earlier in the week.The Daily Mail has a good scoop. It says Stanley Johnson, the prime minister’s father, has flown to his holiday home in Greece - despite current Foreign Office advice saying Britons should avoid “all but essential international travel”.Johnson had to fly via Bulgaria because Greece is not accepting direct flights from the UK, the Mail reports.Asked to justify his trip, Johnson told the paper:I’m in Pelion on essential business trying to Covid-proof my property in view of the upcoming letting season. I need to set up distancing measures at the property because they’re taking it very seriously here. The Greeks are trying to stop bulk arrivals from the UK but they were quite happy to have me coming in. All they wanted to know where I was coming from and what I was doing. Then I had my temperature taken and was swabbed twice.We must get these air bridges set up as soon as possible. From what I’ve seen the arrival of the British will not be a danger to the Greeks because they’re so careful here.Johnson posted a picture of himself at the airport on Instagram:Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Amelia Hill.Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, has just announced that the government is giving an extra £500m to councils in England to help them deal with the coronavirus crisis.In a news release from his department Jenrick said:Councils are playing a huge part in supporting their communities during this pandemic. From supporting the most vulnerable and keeping vital services running to operating local track and trace, council workers have been at the forefront of this great national effort and are the unsung heroes of this pandemic. Today I am providing a further package of support that takes our support for councils during this pandemic to £4.3bn to help meet the immediate pressures councils are facing.And this is what the news release said about the scheme to reimburse councils in England for lost income.Recognising the unprecedented impact the pandemic has had on councils’ income from car parks, museums and other cultural assets, the government is introducing a scheme to compensate them for these losses.This balances the need to provide compensation given the scale of the income losses, encouraging councils to manage and minimise loss where they can and giving them the certainty they need. In the next spending review, we will determine what support councils need to help them meet the pressures of income loss from council tax and business rates.These measures do not offer councils as much as they claim they need. Earlier this week the Local Government Association published an analysis saying councils faced a funding gap of £7.4bn. But with Jenrick due to address the LGA this afternoon (see 8.18am), this will at least give him some good news to announce.Handing over now to Andrew Sparrow, our political correspondent. Here’s wishing a good morning to you all. The glaring omission in the prime minister’s speech is any attempt to draw the leaders of the local economies into the dialogue - and they are the elected mayors."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"From planting to organising the kids\u0026rsquo room, there are lots of ways to keep plastic out of landfillOne Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation Plan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293912.1593667809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who are the new junior ministers all their profiles are here","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Josepha Madigan  has  been appointed  Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special needs and inclusion.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293651.1593638110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bt young scientist technology exhibition to go virtual in 2021","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRebecca Murphy and Abbey Hehir, from St John Bosco Community College, Clare, with their project, Slurry Pit Laser Saves Lives, in January 2020. File photograph: The The BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition (BTYSTE) is going virtual for 2021 because of continued health and safety concerns around Covid-19.The move means that for the first time in the exhibition’s 56 years it will not be staged physically. Instead it will be transformed “into a spectacular virtual showcase for January 2021”, according to BT Ireland. The measure is an indication of how the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to affect staging of public events extending into next year.Europe’s longest-running science event is scheduled go ahead from January 6th to 9th with students exhibiting virtually and judging taking place across digital platforms. A total of 1,800 projects were entered into the 2020 contest, while 550 finalists from 244 schools showcased their entries in January. Some 50,000 people viewed the exhibition at the RDS, which has hosted it since 1966 – its second year.Members of the public in Ireland, and globally, will be able to visit the exhibition online and enjoy a full calendar of events including special acts, the Primary Science Fair, business events and the exhibits, BT Ireland confirmed. The exhibition is retaining its 200 prizes with €7,500 going to the overall winner and an opportunity to represent Ireland at the EU Contest for Young Scientists in Salamanca, Spain, in September 2021. BT Ireland managing director Shay Walsh said: “With the unprecedented global events of the past few months, we have seen first hand the important role that science and technology is playing in finding solutions to this global pandemic.” He said they had looked at the exhibition with a new lens and wanted to ensure it remained firmly on the educational calendar. Mr Walsh said he wanted to encourage students, teachers and schools to get involved in the virtual event and “be part of something truly special” in January. Exhibition head Mari Cahalane said: “People who have experienced the exhibition over the past 56 years understand it is about much more than a science competition. It’s about imagining an idea and then bringing that idea to life through research and development. We’re going to emphasise that in its truest form by bringing the BTYSTE virtual for 2021.” Information sessions for studentsWhile the exhibition inspires thousands of young people each year to explore “near-endless possibilities in science, technology, engineering and maths”, the exhibition team sought this year to do something new in light of current circumstances, she added. “We will be holding information sessions online for students and teachers over the comings months and our website is the best source – www.btyoungscientist – for up-to-date information for students looking to get started on their entries.” The online entry process remains the same as previous years, but project entry fees have been waived. To enter, an inidual or group must submit a one-page proposal outlining their project idea ahead of the closing date of September 22nd. There are four categories: technology social and behavioural science biological and ecological science and chemical, physical and mathematical science. The Primary Science Fair is open to primary-level students from 3rd to 6th class and will run alongside the main exhibition online."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Proposals similar to UK citizenship pathway already drafted, says PM Scott MorrisonAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293753.1593626392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world look away now these are dark days for the united states","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParticipants in a Black Lives Matter protest  in  Trafalgar Square, London. ‘The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.’ Photograph: Niklas HallenEPAAt its midpoint, 2020 is turning out to be one of the darkest years in the peacetime history of the US. It has also affirmed the nation’s global primacy beyond any doubt. Fear not for your columnist’s grip on logical reasoning, at least any more than usual. These contrary claims are reconcilable.The first comes from a mere glance at the facts. The US accounts for a quarter of the world’s recorded deaths from Covid-19. Its people are ignominiously barred from entry to the EU and other allied territories. Unemployment is at its highest rate for a human lifetime. The killing of George Floyd has exposed racial inequities and highlighted once more a homicide rate that marks America out among rich countries.Even if the Depression was more acutely harrowing, there was no pandemic and, from 1933, people had Franklin Roosevelt to lead them, not a thrown, lost-looking Donald Trump. On that point, with the logistical test of a presidential election still ahead, the year has ample room to get worse.Compounding these traumas is intense scrutiny from the rest of the world. And so to the second claim. The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.For all its heft, China does not draw young Europeans to the streets on behalf of Uighurs or the cause of democracy in Hong Kong. At least not in such awesome numbers. It took the Floyd killing at the hands of police to do that. And, while the US has botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic, other countries with dismal records (namely Britain) escape without the same volume or tenor of foreign coverage.Such exposure was the price America once paid for its overwhelming superiority in economic scale and military potential. It was a tax on world leadership and, as such, eminently affordable. With China’s gains in both gross domestic product and armaments, however, even this consolation no longer applies.The US, then, finds itself in the worst of all possible worlds. Its external power and internal cohesion are manifestly in decline. Its psychic hold on the rest of humanity is not. The result is a level of scrutiny that no other nation, not even the other superpower, has to experience – or, perhaps, could withstand. The tighter the inspection, the more numerous the revealed flaws, and the more compromised is America’s ability to command global deference.ObsessionThe whole process is viciously circular. What is a boon for a Washington correspondent – everyone, everywhere has an opinion on the US – can be a bane for Americans themselves.As the tussle develops, China’s obvious advantages over the US include a four-times-larger population and a one-party system’s ability to plan long-term. But a less discussed one is the world’s lower level of obsession with it, for now. This is more often framed as a liability: a lack of soft power, of cultural magnetism, compared with the land of Netflix and all-conquering pop stars. But the corollary is greater freedom from outside invigilation.A discreet rise is what China is said to have achieved over recent decades. The US is condemned to the exact opposite: to wane in public, like an actor who no longer commands the plum roles but remains hounded by paparazzi. Its crimes and mistakes are still aired like no other nation’s.It was natural that America held the world rapt when that world was unipolar. That it continues to do so in 2020 needs some explaining. One reason is the country’s relative openness to media coverage. Another, reinforcing the first, is the English language: it is easier for the average European (or Australian or Nigerian) to follow US public life than China’s.Yet a third reason, it has to be said, is America’s self-image as a standard bearer for the species. Claim city-on-a-hill status, and cynics will comb the city for blemishes and signs of subsidence, even if they do so with tasteless relish or with great hypocrisy. Trump, a raw nationalist, tends to avoid talk of the US as a moral experiment on behalf of mankind. His successors should retain this if no other feature of his presidency.This week, the UK government named some policies after Roosevelt’s New Deal, a now almost 90-year-old programme of disputed effectiveness undertaken in different circumstances in a different continent. The way the US continues to serve as a reference point is impressive. It is a vestigial mark of its time as a truly unchallenged power. But it comes at the cost of painful exposure.The world is moving on from American hegemony. It is not moving on from the American spectacle. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"no need local lockdowns say leaders areas coronavirus watch","story":"Rochdale Borough Council\u0027s chief executive, Steve Rumbelow, said: We\u0027re not at all as bad as Leicester. The one thing we don\u0027t have from PHE, which is crucial in managing the local situation, is the detailed data from the testing.

Such a move should be made in exceptional circumstances, following discussions with parents, and the full curriculum should be restored no later than the summer term.Pupils in their first year of secondary school may need to be re-taught the Year Six syllabus for English and maths, and GCSE pupils may be asked to drop subjects so they can concentrate on getting good grades in English and maths.Pupils should be assessed regularly through quizzes and close scrutiny of their work to make sure they are not falling behind. The guidance stresses that, as an overriding approach, schools should teach a broad and ambitious curriculum which includes a wide range of subjects.Social distancing will not be applied in schools at all times, and pupils will instead be grouped into bubbles to limit the risk of transmission between class or year groups.The bubbles will either be a class or an entire year group who have their lessons, breaks and lunchtime together. In primary school, class bubbles will be the norm, whereas in secondary school bubbles will be expanded to include entire year groups.This approach means that, if a pupil tests positive for coronavirus, it is easier for a school to identify which of their classmates also need to self-isolate.Older children should be encouraged to keep their distance from their peers where they can, but the guidance recognises that this is not possible for younger pupils.Teachers should stay at the front of the class and avoid close face-to-face contact within one metre of pupils.Schools should adapt classrooms to give pupils as much space as possible, such as removing unnecessary furniture.Windows should be kept open where possible, and desks should be set out with pupils sitting side by side, facing the front of the class, rather than sitting face-to-face with their peers.Year groups should be kept apart, meaning that assemblies or any other large gatherings, such as communal prayer, are banned.School choirs and ensembles are also banned, as the guidance warns that there is an additional risk of infection where pupils are singing, chanting, playing wind or brass instruments or shouting. These activities could take place with special controls in place, such as limiting group sizes to 15 pupils and ensuring they stand back-to-back or side-to-side. It should be outdoors where possible, with extended social distancing.Schools should conduct sports lessons outside where possible, and if this is not possible then a large indoor space should be used. Children should do sports lessons within their bubbles, and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned after being used by each year group.Schools should stagger break times and lunchtimes where they can, to make sure that each bubble of students stays apart from other bubbles as much as possible. Outdoor playground equipment should be cleaned more often.School kitchens should be fully open from the start of term, but must comply with the Government\u0027s Covid-19 guidance for food businesses. Dining room surfaces should be cleaned between use by different bubbles. All the normal legal requirements will apply for schools to provide lunch for those who want it, as well as those eligible for free school meals.Schools should stagger the start and end of the day to alleviate congestion and to prevent different year groups or classes from mixing with one another.The school day does not need to be extended to accommodate this, but break times or free periods could be moved around to make it work. The start and end of a school day should not coincide with rush hour, and parents must be told not to congregate at the gate or come on to the premises unless they have an appointment.Schools need to make it clear to pupils and staff that any face masks they wore while travelling to school must be removed on arrival.Schools should update their behaviour policies to include sanctions for breaching the new hygiene or bubble regimes, and the new rules must be clearly explained to pupils and their parents.Teachers are told to prepare for an increase in bad behaviour among children who may have suffered from adversity, trauma and a lack of routine during lockdown.Pupils may struggle to re-engage with learning, and teachers will need to work hard to reintegrate them into school life. Schools can discipline unruly children, but should only expel them as a last resort.The guidance reminds teachers that off-rolling is never acceptable and that parents should not be pressured into home-schooling their child.Pupils should walk or cycle to school where possible and avoid using public transport, particularly at peak times such as rush hour.Schools could set up walking buses, where a teacher accompanies a group of children walking to or from school. Where pupils do need to use public transport to get to school, local councils will be asked to prioritise taking them on buses.Where pupils are using dedicated school transport, they do not need to socially distance from one another, but pupils should remain in their bubbles where they can. If they are mixing with other bubbles, they should wear face masks. Children should use hand sanitiser when getting on and off a school bus, while vehicles should be regularly cleaned.Children and staff should wash their hands immediately when they arrive at school, as well as regularly throughout the day.The mantra of catch it, bin it, kill it should be drilled into all pupils, meaning anyone who coughs or sneezes should use a disposable tissue and then throw it away. Schools need to make sure there are enough tissues and bins in the school for pupils to follow this directive.Frequently-touched surfaces should be cleaned using detergents and bleach, and the whole school premises should be regularly cleaned.Face masks are generally not necessary in schools as they inhibit communication, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is only necessary if a child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school and a teacher is unable to stay two metres away while waiting for them to be picked up by their parents.Teachers have been told to make sure that remote learning is fully integrated into their lesson plans since it may need to be an essential component of children\u0027s learning if there is a local lockdown and a school is closed down.Schools must have contingency plans in place for remote learning by the end of September at the latest. This should include high quality online resources for children and teaching videos, as well as printed worksheets and textbooks for those who do not have computers.Children who are leaning at home must be set meaningful and ambitious work in different subjects every day, and this must be equivalent in standard to what they would have learnt during a normal school day.Remote learning plans should also be in place for any students who are self-isolating, as well as pupils who are shielding.Read more: Home-schooling tips and secrets for parentsAll league tables are suspended for the next academic year. GCSEs and A-levels will take place in summer 2021, but with some adaptations, including those which will free up teaching time.The exam regulator, Ofqual, will publish detailed proposals on this in the coming weeks. Schools will also be expected to put on a full series of GCSE and A-level exams this autumn for pupils wishing to appeal against the predicted grades they are given this summer.  All statutory tests, including the phonics screening check, Year Four times tables tests and Year Six Sats, will take place next academic year as normal.If a school has two or more confirmed cases of coronavirus within two weeks, or an overall rise in sickness or absence where coronavirus is suspected as a cause, this will be seen as a possible outbreak. In such a case, the school must liaise with their local health protection team who will advise on whether further action is needed.The health protection team may recommend that a number of other pupils stay at home and self-isolate as a precaution. This could include an entire year group or even all pupils in the whole school.School closures will not generally be necessary and should not be implemented unless on the advice of health experts. If an outbreak in a school is declared, a mobile testing unit may be sent to the school so that any pupils or staff can be tested. Testing will initially focus on the ill pupil\u0027s class, followed by their year group and, if necessary, the entire school.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools turn pupils unprepared reception coronavirus lockdown","story":"Schools are refusing to admit new reception pupils as they say that the coronavirus lockdown means they are not ready to join.Head teachers are advising parents to keep their children in nursery for an extra year to ensure that they are sufficiently prepared to start school in September 2021.Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, which represents 14,000 nurseries and childminders, said he was aware of some schools that have taken this position.Children will have had a significant chunk of their development curtailed because of coronavirus, he said.They have missed out on their final period in early years settings during lockdown.Some schools will argue that they are not adequately prepared to take children at an earlier stage of development.They say they would rather the children stay on longer at nursery, catch up, and then take them into reception next September.Nurseries were ordered to close on March 20 on the same day as schools, and have been allowed to reopen since June 1.Mr Leitch said that a child\u0027s development during their early years was not linear and the final year of nursery was crucial for their school readiness.He added: It is a bit ridiculous because the £1 billion catch-up money went to schools and not a penny went to nurseries.Documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) earlier this year predicted that children would suffer lifelong damage because of lockdown.The documents detailed the evidence seen by Sage on whether it was safe to allow pupils to return to the classroom.A cohort of children have experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives, their report said.Mr Leitch said that another reason schools may be refusing to accept new pupils in reception was because they wanted to keep their numbers low in order to better implement social distancing measures.It is much easier to stop new admissions than to tell parents that your child will not be able to be accommodated next year, he said.Parents are given some flexibility about when they enrol their child in reception. Children are allowed to stay in nursery for one term after their fifth birthday.Mr Leitch said that while many schools had committed to admitting students in reception, some had not.He urged the Government to publish clear guidance on whether or not they were encouraging the practice of keeping children in nursery for an extra year.Last month, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would pay for private tutors for children who have fallen behind during lockdown as part of a £1 billion catch-up plan.Schools will be given money to hire in-house tutors, who can run extra classes for small groups of pupils throughout the academic year.The £350 million tutoring programme will be targeted at the most disadvantaged children in the country, who have fared the worst while schools have been closed.Head teachers will also be given £650 million to spend on catch-up activities for youngsters, which could include summer camps.Early years leaders have previously warned that a nursery crisis is looming, with one in six childcare providers saying they expect to permanently close as a result of the pandemic.The poll, of more than 2,000 early years providers, which was conducted earlier this year by the UK\u0027s biggest online childcare platform, childcare, found that only half planned to stay open, with the remaining third saying they had not yet decided either way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"significant number people may have natural immunity coronavirus","story":"Professor Sarah Gilbert, of the vaccine team, said: It\u0027s possible that we are underestimating natural or already acquired immunity to this virus, and we really need to keep an eye on it.A recent study suggested children may be protected from coronavirus because they catch so many colds. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china vows corresponding measures uk enacts hong kong citizenship","story":"China promised Thursday to take countermeasures against Britain if it presses ahead with plans to extend citizenship rights to Hong Kongers after Beijing imposed a sweeping security law on the restless financial hub.Beijing has faced a groundswell of criticism from primarily Western nations over its decision to impose a new law outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.Hong Kong police arrested a 24-year-old man at the city\u0027s airport in the early hours of Thursday on suspicion of attacking and wounding an officer during protests against a new national security law Beijing imposed on the financial hub.Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas and arrested more than 300 people on Wednesday as protesters took to the streets in defiance of the sweeping security legislation introduced by China to snuff out dissent.On Wednesday, police posted pictures on Twitter of an officer with a bleeding arm saying he was stabbed by rioters holding sharp objects. The suspects fled while bystanders offered no help, police said.A police spokesman told Reuters the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm if he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport.Local newspaper Apple Daily, citing unnamed sources, said the suspect was onboard a Cathay Pacific flight to London due to depart just before midnight.Adding to concerns of Beijing\u0027s crackdown, Hong Kong\u0027s influential Bar Association published a new legal analysis warning that the wording of the law - which was kept secret until Tuesday - undermines the city\u0027s independent judiciary and stifles freedoms.Britain has said the law breaches China\u0027s pre-handover One Country, Two Systems promise to grant residents key liberties - as well as judicial and legislative autonomy - until 2047.It has responded by announcing plans to allow millions of Hong Kongers with British National Overseas status to relocate with their families and eventually apply for citizenship.We will live up to our promises to them, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament.That move has infuriated Beijing, which says Britain promised not to grant full citizenship rights to Hongkongers ahead of the 1997 handover.If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations, China\u0027s embassy in London said Thursday.We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures, it added.On Thursday, Australian leader Scott Morrison said he was very actively considering offering Hong Kongers safe haven.Taiwan has opened an office to help Hongkongers wanting to flee, while a proposed bill in the United States offering sanctuary to city residents has received widespread bipartisan support.Beijing says the law is needed to quell seething pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and restore order after a year of political unrest.But critics fear it will usher in a new era of political repression given similar laws are routinely used to crush dissent on the Chinese mainland.The law has sent fear coursing through the city and rattled the legal community in a business hub that has built its reputation on the independence and reliability of its courts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dog year isnt seven human years scientists find pets might older","story":"A commonly held belief among dog owners is that if they want to know how old their pet is, they simply have to times its age by seven.Then, it can be decided whether man\u0027s best friend is acting up because it is a naughty teenager - or simply due to poor training.However, new research has found that this method is not based on science, and our pooches may be far \u0027older\u0027 than previously believed.As people, and animals, age, the number and placement of methyl groups in the genome change. By mapping these, scientists can tell the age of an organism.The researchers from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine used blood samples from 105 Labrador retrievers to accurately work out how quickly the breed ages. The study, published in Cell Systems, found the comparison is not a 1:7 ratio over time. Especially when dogs are young, they age rapidly compared to humans. A one-year-old dog is similar to a 30-year-old human. A four-year-old dog is similar to a 52-year-old human. Then by seven years old, dog aging slows, and a 12-year-old dog is 70 in human years.This makes sense when you think about it - after all, a nine-month-old dog can have puppies, so we already knew that the 1:7 ratio wasn\u0027t an accurate measure of age, said senior author Dr Trey Ideker, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.Scientists say this new comparison between dog ageing and human could be helpful for vets, so they can work out whether illnesses in dogs are age-related. The formula provides a new epigenetic clock, a method for determining the age of a cell, tissue or organism based on a readout of its epigenetics, which are chemical modifications like methylation, which influence which genes are off or on without altering the inherited genetic code.Previous studies have found epigenetic clocks for humans, but these don\u0027t translate to other species and may not even be the same for other humans.One limitation of this clock is they only used blood from Labradors, and different breeds are known to live for different amounts of time.  Dr Ideker plans to test more breeds, but said that since it\u0027s accurate for humans and mice as well as Labrador retrievers, he predicts the clock will apply to all dog breeds.I have a six-year-old dog -- she still runs with me, but I\u0027m now realising that she\u0027s not as \u0027young\u0027 as I thought she was, Dr Ideker added.He said dogs are interesting to study because they live so closely with us, perhaps more than any other animal, so a dog\u0027s environmental and chemical exposures are very similar to humans, and they receive nearly the same levels of health care.The research could be useful for humans, not just their pets. The scientists believe the epigenetic clock could be used to test anti-ageing treatments, to see if they had made any difference to the methylation patterns in the genome and therefore altered the \u0027age\u0027 of human cells.There are a lot of anti-ageing products out there these days - with wildly varying degrees of scientific support, Dr Ideker said,  But how do you know if a product will truly extend your life without waiting 40 years or so? What if you could instead measure your age-associated methylation patterns before, during and after the intervention to see if it\u0027s doing anything?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 2nd july 2020","story":"Police detain a protester after being sprayed with pepper spray during a protest in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong before the annual handover march and against China\u0027s national security law that cracks down on protests in Hong KongTravel news latest: Air bridges plan scuppered by row with ScotlandActor Johnny Depp\u0026#39s libel claim over being referred as a wife beater will go ahead next week, High Court rulesRevealed: The new coronavirus guidelines for schools to open in SeptemberAir bridges shelved as holidaymakers cleared for take-off to 75 countriesHong Kong police arrest 24-year-old man on London-bound flight as China vows \u0026#39retaliation\u0026#39 for UK offer of citizenshipComment: It\u0026#39s hard to see what benefit a local lockdown like Leicester\u0026#39s will actually haveComment: Labour is stealing a march on the government with its new China hawkishnessRussia\u0026#39s Putin wins \u0026#39by landslide\u0026#39 to stay in power at least until 2036Bastille Day 2020: how a prison riot and the Tennis Court Oath overthrew the Bourbon monarchyDominic Raab hits out at HSBC as first arrests made under Hong Kong security lawJuly 4th 2020: how a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to US Independence DayThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayTrump\u0026#39s July 4 celebration at Mount Rushmore provokes fury among Native AmericansWatch: What will hairdressers look like on July 4?Thursday morning news briefing: Holidays cleared for take-offShaun Bailey pledges to drop \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39 statue review on first day as London mayorCoronavirus vaccine \u0026#39almost 100pc certain to be found\u0026#39Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/27/17/skyline-beavis.jpg","title":"beavis butt head reboot comedy central mike judge gen z","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.It is not known whether characters will still be teenagersBeavis and Butt-Head is coming back with two new seasons set in the present day.The adult animation, which originally ran from 1992 to 1997, is being rebooted by Comedy Central for the new seasons and a special.Series creator Mike Judge will return to write, produce and provide voices for the series, which will see the titular slacker teenagers enter “a whole new Gen Z world” that will appeal to both old fans of the show and first-time viewers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It seemed like the time was right to get stupid again,” Judge said about the show’s return.ViacomCBS’s Chris McCarthy said: “We are thrilled to be working with Mike Judge and the great team at 3 Arts again as we double down on adult animation at Comedy Central.Simon Armitage: ‘The events of this year are all I can think about’Ciaran Lavery: ‘I think most musicians are quite bitchy and jealous’Burping and belching babes: How Ladette to Lady defined an era“Beavis and Butt-Head were a defining voice of a generation, and we can’t wait to watch as they navigate the treacherous waters of a world light-years from their own.”It’s unclear whether the characters will still be teenagers in the new episodes or will have grown up with their audience.Beavis and Butt-Head originally ran for seven seasons and spawned a 1996 feature film, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, as well as an initial series revival in 2011.Beavis and Butt-Head\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

But it appears to have either been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere, or never failed to form one.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, researchers can see the core that would normally be found inside such an exoplanet. That allows them to look inside the interior of the world and learn about its composition.The newly discovered planet orbits a star similar to our Sun, and is found about 730 light years away. It is known as TOI 849 b, and conditions there are intense: it is so close to its star that a year takes 18 hours, and the surface temperature is around 1,500C.That places the planet right in the Neptunian Desert, the region near stars where planets the size of Neptune are rarely found.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien life“The planet is strangely close to its star, considering its mass,” said David Armstrong from the University of Warwick, the lead author of the study, in a statement. “In other words, we don’t see planets with this mass at these short orbital periods.”Researchers were able to conclude that it was just a planetary core by conducting detailed measurements, which found that the planet is about 40 times heavier than the Earth, but only 3.4 times as large. That density must mean that it is made up mostly of iron, rock and water, with only small amounts of hydrogen and helium.“The fact that we don’t see those gases lets us know TOI 849 b is an exposed planetary core,” said Dr Armstrong.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It was then further analysed by the HARPS instrument run by the European Southern Observatory, which uses the Doppler effect to measure exoplanets by looking for the wobble in their light that happens as they move nearer and further from us.“One way or another, TOI 849 b either used to be a gas giant or is a ‘failed’ gas giant,” said Dr Armstrong.“It’s a first, telling us that planets like this exist and can be found.“We have the opportunity to look at the core of a planet in a way that we can’t do in our own solar system.“There are still big open questions about the nature of Jupiter’s core, for example, so strange and unusual exoplanets like this give us a window into planet formation that we have no other way to explore.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is the most deadly confrontation in the area in 45 years.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The project manager from Colindale felt “guilty” about sitting at home while supported by taxpayer money through the furlough scheme. “I wanted to help others,” he said. He and his girlfriend signed up to work one day a week at OneStonegrove.He said: “We have spoken about doing this when it’s all over. It’s great to help out.”Readers have just three more days to bid for a piece of Sir Peter’s Blake’s pop artwork, Our Fans, to raise money for Help The Hungry. The auction of the giant mural – which echoes Sir Peter’s design of The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album and was draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel during its 2017 renovation – closes at midnight on Friday. There are 100 fragments, each featuring a famous face such as Ringo Starr or Annie Lennox.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And it’s a lovely unicorn.”After the newsreader’s input, Scarlett then begins to ask Dr Wenham: “What’s his name? What’s his name mummy?”Minister’s BBC interview interrupted three times by other callsVirtual Supreme Court hearing is interrupted by flushing toilet Arnold Schwarzenegger interview interrupted by donkey and tiny horseBBC News viewers in stitches as Robert Kelly returns with childrenThe mother gently shushes her daughter as Fraser says “do stop me if you need to crack on,” before telling the girl: “My name is Christian.”“Christian,” Scarlett repeats, before adding: “I’m just deciding where it can go. Where mummy wants it to go. Mummy where do you want it to go?”Dr Wenham agrees the artwork would look great on the shelf and apologises to the interviewer as they both share a laugh.The footage was reminiscent of a similar BBC interview in 2017, in which an interview about South Korean politics was crashed by two youngsters.A live interview with an MSNBC correspondent was similarly interrupted by her daughter in 2019.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There would be no objection, they say, to servicemen and women taking the knee or going on marches for human rights when they are wearing civilian clothing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere is, however, no central directive from the Ministry of Defence on taking the knee, and service personnel in uniform have regularly taken part in LGBT+ Pride marches without censure.The issue under discussion, it is believed, is whether the gesture would be seen to be tied to an overtly political movement. Defence officials acknowledge, however, that taking the knee has a history with  the US civil rights movement,  and any decision on it will take this into account.There is an apparent element of confusion in the government about taking the knee. Foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said recently that the gesture came from TV series Game of Thrones, triggering social media postings of photographs of Martin Luther King carrying out the action during the struggle against segregation in the American South.

The service’s union, the Police Federation, said this showed “we are all human beings”.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “We do not tolerate racism and promote ersity and equality. The recent protests have reminded us that we all have a role to play shaping a better future.” Officials point out that the military has consistently won awards over the years for being among the best employers for racially erse personnel in the country.Dominic Raab says taking the knee has ‘feudal connotation’Education minister says he would take the knee in support of BLMRaab ridiculed for claiming taking a knee comes from Game of ThronesSenior officers say they accept much more needs to be done to eradicate racism in the armed forces. In a letter to members of the Army, Royal Navy and the RAF, General Sir Nick Carter said recent protests “have brought the issues of racism and discrimination sharply into focus. We owe it to our black, Asian and minority ethnic servicemen and women, who will be feeling concerned at the moment, to try to look at this from their perspective, to listen and to continue to make change happen”.The chief of defence staff said that although the armed forces is a “rich mix of faiths, colour, gender and creeds reflected in British society”, it must be ensured that people are judged on their abilities and “not for what they look like or where they come from”.Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, recently stressed that the military must “reset” its “woeful” record on discrimination against black and minority ethnic personnel. In an interview with The House magazine he said it had historically “not done well enough” in either recruiting or welcoming people from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) background.Figures published by the Service Complaints Ombudsman for the Armed Forces show that Bame personnel are more likely to complain about bullying, harassment and discrimination than their white counterparts. While Bame staff make up just 7 per cent of overall armed forces personnel, they account for a disproportionate 13 per cent of those lodging complaints about discrimination.Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Cities and towns including Bradford, Barnsley and Oldham as well as parts of London are being monitored closely amid fears that Leicester-style flare-ups of coronavirus could emerge elsewhere in the country.But officials believe that the outbreak on Leicester remains on a different scale from other sites where mini-spikes have emerged in recent weeks, and no further city-wide lockdowns are expected within the coming days, official sources told The Independent.All eyes are on the virus’s response to the ‘super Saturday’ relaxation of lockdown restrictions on 4 July, when pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be among thousands of businesses reopening after more than 100 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrime minister Boris Johnson has said he will not hesitate to reimpose localised controls should testing reveal new pockets of infection following the weekend.The decision to exempt Leicester from Saturday’s rollback of lockdown was taken after infection rates reached 135 per 100,000 population in the East Midlands city, with signs that the virus had broken out of inidual workplaces and institutions and was spreading within households.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe city’s infection rate remains more than three times the next biggest hotspot, Bradford, at around 40 per 100,000.

But the source said that as things stand no active preparations are understood to be being made for Leicester-style city-wide lockdowns in the coming days.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Maintaining distinct groups or ‘bubbles’ that do not mix makes it quicker and easier in the event of a positive case to identify those who may need to self-isolate, and keep that number as small as possible.Workers to be made jobless by coronavirus \u0027cannot get retraining\u0027Two or more confirmed cases at a school within a 14 day period will trigger a response decided by local authorities, with children potentially being sent home again.The government says mobile testing units will be dispatched to schools by local authorities where an outbreak in a school is confirmed.The guidance says desks should all be rearranged to face forwards, with children facing the front of the classroom rather than side by side - with unnecessary furniture removed from classrooms to enable social distancing.Assemblies and other gatherings of more than one bubble will also be out of bounds in order to stop the spread of the virus between groups.The government suggests that timetables, school start times and and break times should be staggered, with specifics left up to each school depending on its circumstances and layout.The new rules will apply from September when all pupils return to school following the summer break. Some children, notable those of designated key workers, are already in schools.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: The global gap in education Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Teachers warned that some of the plans would be enormously challenging to implement, with a headteachers\u0027 union singling out provisions for bubbles.The logistics of keeping apart many different \u0027bubbles\u0027 of children in a full school, including whole-year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind boggling, said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL).The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The US House of Representatives has unanimously approved a bill that imposes sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the new national security law for Hong Kong.The bill will punish any banks that do business with a list of senior Chinese officials involved in Hong Kong affairs, and also targets police units in Hong Kong that have clashed with protesters over the past 13 months of unrest in the city.The bill had already passed the Senate, but now goes back to the upper house after some changes were made. The Senate could hold a second vote as early as Thursday, before the bill is sent to Donald Trump for his approval or veto.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking in a rare appearance at the influential House Foreign Affairs Committee ahead of Wednesday afternoon’s vote, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the new Hong Kong security law represented “a brutal, sweeping crackdown against the people of Hong Kong, intended to destroy the freedoms they were promised” during the handover from Britain.The new law in Hong Kong defines and bans “subversion”, “secessionism”, “terrorism” and “foreign collusion”, as well as setting up a national security office in the city for the first time that will not be answerable to local laws.Trump \u0027squandered\u0027 Hong Kong to \u0027sell soybeans\u0027 to China, Dem saysThis new security law turns Hong Kong into a Chinese police stateHong Kong paying millions to London PR firm to improve imageAlso speaking in that hearing was the prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and former Legislative Council member Nathan Law, who said China “must be held accountable for the promises it has made to both Hong Kongers and the world”.“Through fear intimidation, and heavy-handed governance, Beijing turns Hong Kong into just another Chinese city while trying to keep its outer shell,” he told the committee. “In doing so, it hopes to preserve the illusion that the city is still autonomous. The international community must not be confused.”Simply by speaking to the US congressional body, Law said, he risks being found in violation of the new law’s provisions on colluding with foreign powers. Law said he had previously testified to the committee twice in the past year, but that then he “did not have to worry about going back to Hong Kong afterward to continue my street activism”, adding: “This time is different.”Ms Pelosi, who has been a vocal critic of Beijing’s actions regarding Hong Kong, later said that the US sanctions were “an urgently needed response to the cowardly Chinese government\u0027s passage of its so-called \u0027national security\u0027 law”.Politicians from both American parties urged the Trump administration to take strong action against China over the Hong Kong law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The administration has halted defence exports to Hong Kong that might also double up as police equipment, and restricted the territory\u0027s access to high technology products.China has said it will respond by imposing visa restrictions on Americans seen as interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs - a move Mr Pompeo called “a sign of how Beijing refuses to take responsibility for its own choices”.China also said on Thursday that it “reserves the right to take corresponding measures” against Britain, Hong Kong’s former colonial power, after Boris Johnson said the UK would push ahead with its offer to ease visa rules for some three million Hong Kongers.Britain said that anyone born in Hong Kong before 1997 would be allowed to come to the UK and stay for extendable periods of up to one year, potentially giving them the right to eventually apply for British citizenship down the line.In a statement on Thursday, the Chinese embassy in London said: “If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations. We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures.”The embassy also called on Britain “to view objectively and fairly the national security legislation for Hong Kong, respect China\u0027s position and concerns, (and) refrain from interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way”.House of Representatives\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Ardern responded to the second breach by demoting the 47-year-old in her cabinet rankings.Ardern, who has been widely praised for her handling of the pandemic, held back on firing Clark, saying that his expertise was needed to steer New Zealand through the crisis.Jacinda Ardern rejects calls to open New Zealand bordersBut Clarke came under fire again in recent weeks after a series of quarantine errors at the New Zealand border. Two UK travellers who later tested positive for the novel disease were allowed to leave quarantine facilities without being tested – just weeks after Ms Ardern had declared victory over the disease.Clarke appeared to blame director-general for health Dr Ashley Bloomfield for the missteps, a move that provoked anger among the public who are highly supportive of the latter.Ardern accepted Clark’s resignation, saying it was “essential our health leadership has the confidence of the New Zealand public”.“David has come to the conclusion his presence in the role is creating an unhelpful distraction from the government’s ongoing response to Covid-19 and wider health reforms,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Great Britain, we have agreed to speed up these negotiations to be able to agree on a deal in autumn, which would then also need to be ratied until the end of the year.Yet, Merkel also fired a warning at her UK counterparts, adding: With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves.It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.This comes as Parliament passed the Immigration Bill last night that would end the UKs Freedom of Movement with the European Union, which will see EU nationals and their families will be subjected to UKs immigration laws.Follow our Brexit live blog below for all the latest updates…Britain is set to reopen its temporary market access regime for EU financial companies in September.This is to help firms through the Brexit orce period, City A.M. reported.There is currently a “temporary permissions regime” in place for EU-based financial companies.

The leader of Change UK said:#Im a realist and the reality is weve left the European Union.#I dont think theres an appetite at large for some movement that would win widespread support for us to rejoin because we havent even fully left yet.#I think it will be my childrens generation that will do it, I think well be back in the EU in ten years time.#Of course well never get the unique and very special and very good deal that we once had.#No doubt the EU will say wellyou want to rejoin you have to join the Euro, youve got to join Schengen.

Speaking with Channel  News, he said #both sides are to blame#a no-deal Brexit went ahead.The prospect #would be disadvantageous to both sides# but it would #hit Britain much harder# the MP said.However, he added: #We still can do something # we are living in a threatening, chaotic world and we have to stay together because unity means strength.#Britain is alone # we are #.Angela Merkel says Britain will have to #live with the consequences# of Boris Johnsons decision to loosen economic ties with the EU in the event of a no-deal exit.The PM scrapped the idea of maintaining close economic ties with the EU after the Brexit transition period ends on December .

The people who are going to be making the decisions are hard-headed, responsible iniduals. #Theyre not going to listen to political speeches before they make political decisions. #They will look at the hard facts as they see them on the ground. What are our sales like  What order books are we facing  What markets do we think were going to penetrate  #What trade deals has anyone actually signed  When you start answering those questions you can begin to talk about bounce. But until you answer those questions you are spitting in the wind”.He said he believed that taxes would have to rise as a result of the pandemic, saying that “someones got to pay for the spending round that COVID has injected in to our economy”.Brexit-basher George Soros has predicted the coronavirus crisis could doom the EU and #destroy capitalism as we know it#. Soros fears because the EU project is not finished its struggling to deal with the fast developing Covid- catastrophe.The Hungarian-born currency speculator, now a US citizen, also predicts the extraordinary economic slump that is expected to unfold in the coming months could change the face of capitalism.The anti-Brexit campaigner and donor to the second referendum campaign made the forecasts in an interview with the Independent.He said: #I am particularly concerned about the survival of the EU because it is an incomplete union.#It was in the process of being created.#But the process was never completed and that makes Europe exceptionally vulnerable – more vulnerable than the US not just because it is an incomplete union but also because it is based on the rule of law.#And the wheels of justice move very slowly, while threats such as the Covid- virus move very fast.#Hopes of a COVID- vaccine pulled European stocks from losses earlier on Wednesday, after fears of a no-deal Brexit and anxieties relating to the European Unions recovery fund had weighed on sentiment.Ending a choppy session, the pan-European STOXX  index rose . per cent, with blue-chip indexes in Paris, Milan and London down about . per cent.

including the House of Commons #Boris Johnsons Government continues to block a second Scottish independence referendum, one of the partys most senior MPs has suggested.Pete Wishart, an SNP MP for almost two decades, said the party could consider #withdrawing from the apparatus of the UK state#Westminster continues to reject calls for a fresh vote on the issue.This could be #escalated# to the extent of impacting on the SNPs #participation in institutions of the UK Parliament#, he added.Mr Wishart arguedWestminster continues to refuse calls for a referendum, the Scottish Government could try to seek the support of the European Union and the international community for such a ballot.The UK has insisted that it wants to #work constructively# with the EU.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: #We believe that there is a free trade agreement to be reached but we have also been very clear that we will be prepared for either eventuality at the end of the year, whether that be a free trade agreement or having a trading relationship based on the same terms that Australia currently has.#Australia does not yet have a formal trade deal with the EU.Image: AFPDowning Street has stressed the UK will be prepared to trade with the European Union without a formal agreement as German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Brussels to step up preparations for a no-deal scenario.Mrs Merkel suggested progress so far had been #very limited# and the EU must be ready for the possibility that #a deal doesnt materialise#.Germany has assumed the rotating EU Council presidency for the next six months, giving the chancellor an influential role in the final phase of the Brexit process.Mrs Merkel told the German parliament that although talks between the UK and EU were intensying, the EU #must be prepared# for the possibility that a deal will not be reached.Tory MPs have blocked a bid to prevent prime ministers being nominated without the consent of Parliament.Bringing forward such proposals, SNP Cabinet Office spokesman Pete Wishart said any prime minister should demonstrate that they have the confidence of the Commons.The Prime Ministerand CabinetBill was brought forward with Theresa May and Boris Johnson having both previously assumed office without a general election.Referencing the period of ill-health suffered by Boris Johnson earlier this year, Mr Wishart argued: #All of us are right relieved to see the Prime Minister back in such rude health, press-upping his way to his disastrous Brexit.#And looking at this epitome of a butchers dog, its hard to believe that it was touch and go for him only a few short weeks ago and thank goodness that the Prime Minister pulled through.#But what we found with the Prime Ministers incapacitation was the equivalent of government by headless chicken.#Without the Prime Ministers customary decisiveness and note for detail, we had no real idea who was running the country.#One of the big sticking points in this round of discussions between the UK and the EU has been over equivalence for financial services.The EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier says the UK hasnt completed necessary assessments by todays deadline.It comes as the UK attempts to determine the Citys access to EU markets after Brexit.But EU officials said the UK has so far only answered four of  questionnaires sent by Brussels seeking more information on British regulation of the financial services industry.However, today, Boris Johnsons official spokesman says the UK has completed the assessments # and officials are now awaiting a response from the EU.Japan and Britain aim to clinch a trade deal by the end of July and Tokyo wants to secure at least the same automobile tarfs as it has in its existing European Union trade pact, Tokyos chief negotiator said.Japans Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and British trade minister Liz Truss agreed last month on a swt deal on an economic partnership to secure business continuity.Meanwhile, Tokyo wants to conclude trade talks with Britain by the end of July as Japan needs any agreement to go through legal checks before submitting it to parliament, which is expected to be held this autumn.#It is our highest priority to achieve an agreement within the time frame# We need to adjust ambitions to a realistic level,# Hiroshi Matsuura, who is chief negotiator for trade talks with Britain told Reuters.Some reaction now on those last two blog posts.Alex Veitch, head of International Policy at FTA, which represents freight transport companies, told the I: “The logistics industry is keen to learn details of any system to facilitate the export of goods across EU borders, and is ready to support the preparations of such a system so that it can be ready for January , . #We are currently talking to UK government and EU partners to understand all the system requirements and brief our members. #It takes two to tango, and we need both import and export systems to be ready, tested, and operational to keep Britain trading.”Image: GettyThere are concerns over a new customs process after it was reported that UK-based businesses exporting to the EU will have to wait for permission from the taxman before moving their goods.Some fear the new system, which will be based around HMRC giving approval, will cause signicant delays at entry and exit points to the UK.And critics say there could be tailbacks of lorries at ports.However, officials say the new system will help ports with limited space cope with the extra delays leaving the single market and customs union will cause # by restricting the flow of vehicles.One of the big Brexit stories this week is that British businesses exporting to the EU will have to wait for permission from HMRC before moving their goods.Its part of new plans to stave off chaos at ports.Plans drawn up by officials and reported by Bloomberg say lorries will only be allowed to begin their journey to Doverthey have a valid reference from the new # and so far, untested # Goods Vehicle Movement Service.The system, which is still under development six months from the end of the Brexit transition period, will bar trucks without prior clearance from heading for the channel.Michel Barnier slammed Britains #unacceptable# demands on financial services in a speech to bankers.Addressing a think tank he fumed: #The UK is trying to keep as many single market benefits as it can. #It would like to make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent.#He added a decision on #equivalence# so British banks can carry on trading with the continent has been delayed by the UK failing topaperwork.But British officials blamed Brussels for sending over more than a thousand pages of questions, many of which are irrelevant. Image: ReutersGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the EU must prepare for a possible failure of talks with Britain over a new its new trading relationship.She said the talks will be sped up to achieve an agreement in autumn so it could be ratied by the end of the years.She told the lower house of parliament that the EU #must and should prepare for a situation in which an agreement does not happen#.Scottish ministers #need to wake up to the fact that we have left the EU#, the Scotland Secretary told MPs.Alister Jack said: #I know the Scottish Government dont like the outcomes of referendums when they dont go their way, but this is another one were delivering on.#SNP MP Pete Wishart asked: #An opinion poll recently found that  per cent of the Scottish people back a Brexit extension on top of an overwhelming majority who opposed a Brexit disaster in its entirety.#And the Secretary of States probably seen an opinion poll that finds  per cent of the Scottish people now want an independent Scotland. #What does the Secretary of State believe links these opinion polls and what does it tell him about where our countrys headed #Mr Jack replied: #I think the whole House would like to congratulate him on giving up his own independence getting engaged last weekend. #The answer is that we had a general election, we had a resounding majority across the UK for a manesto that said we would leave, we would honour the result of the referendum. #We are going to honour that result, were going to take back control of our laws, our borders, our money and were going to leave the hated Common Fisheries Policy # heres the independent bit forwere going to become an independent coastal state.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I won’t be having one, and I won’t be having one in a pub because I don’t want to risk my health or the health of my mates, or the health of my family.”  Police have also revealed they will issue fines as a last resort for those who breach the lockdown measures and travel from Leicester to Nottingham to shop or visit pubs this weekend.Nottinghamshire Police will be working with British Transport Police to ensure people are not jumping on trains to nearby Nottingham to watch Leicester City play on super Saturday or enjoy a few pints as lockdown eases for the rest of the country.Anyone spotted travelling from Leicester will be stopped and asked tohome, with £ fines issued as a last resort.Meanwhile crisp maker Walkers has revealed  positive cases of Covid- at its factory in Leicester. The company - which employs , people across the site in the Beaumont Leys area of the city - said it had seen a “steady increase” in the number of confirmed cases during June.The company claims the rise “coincides with the roll-out and uptake of testing”.Walkers said its track and trace procedure indicated the transmission of the virus was “not in our factory”.IS there anything at all Labour and the Remain resistance bores won’t blame Boris Johnson for Sir Keir Starmer now accuses him of being late to lock Leicester back down, asHE would have hammered schools and businesses by doing so overnight at the first glimmer of evidence of a spike.He even had the gall to imply Boris, currently shoring up million workers with taxpayers’ money, wasn’t focused enough on saving jobs.Labour seem to believe furlough bailouts should go on and on until we are actually bankrupt.Boris’s critics say he was too reluctant too eager to lock down, late early to lt it and reckless over-cautious on schools. He is somehow to blame for Leicester’s plight and for people enjoying Bournemouth beach when the sun’s out.The juvenility of the Corbyn era lives on.A spokesperson said: “We have shared our data and analysis with the health authorities and they support the view that our situation reflects transmission in the community and we do not have a transmission issue on site.”The company added employees with a confirmed or suspected case of Covid- were self-isolating on full pay.A number of other food processing plants in Leicester have had confirmed cases of the infection, including Samworth Brothers and Pladis, which makes biscuits for McVities.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more. And during lockdown people worked perfectly well from home.Imagine how many homes we could create by changing offices into flats.And how much rent businesses would save.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think you have to keep an open mind about whether you have a large number of people who have protective T-cells in the absence of antibodies.Sir John also warned that the UK must prepare for the worst this winter, instead of relying on the development of a successful coronavirus vaccine.His comments came in response to Greg Clark, chairman of the Science and Technology Select Committee, who askedthe country should be preparing for the winter without a vaccine, orone might be ready in time.Sir John said: This whole epidemic has relied too heavily on assumptions that have turned out not to be true.So, my strong advice is be prepared for the worst.The MPs also heard that it could be chaos in hospitalsthe UK sees a resurgence of coronavirus this winter, alongside a serious flu season.Sir John said it was therefore important to make sure that people were getting the flu vaccine.He explained: I think one of the things that clinical staff in hospitals worry about iswe do have a signicant flu season.Then we are going to have a bit of a clinical problemweve also got Covid running alongside because youll get people with severe pneumonias arriving with fever and all the usual things, and itll be pandemonium in the AE departments.So, what Im rather hoping is that first of all we ideally expand the number of people getting flu vaccines so we get better coverage, and secondly we push quite hard to make sure people are compliant and participate in the flu vaccine programmes.The uptake is lamentably small in some countries and I think were not messing around anymore.This could be really seriouspeople dont get their vaccines.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Kate Bingham, chairwoman of the UKs Vaccine Taskforce, told the committee that while she was optimistic that a vaccine would be developed, in the short-term it may just be one that reduces the severity of the disease, rather than prevents people from getting it.Asked when a vaccine may be available, she said maybe by early next year depending on the success of clinical trials.Prof Gilbert told the committee she hoped their vaccine might be ready earlier, but it depended on trials showing efficacy, and she could not put a time frame on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We urge the British side to view objectively and fairly the national security legislation for Hong Kong, respect Chinas position and concerns, refrain from interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who unveiled the escape offer to British Nationals Overseas -last night admitted there would be little the UK could doChina prevented people trying to leave Hong Kong. The diplomatic spat came after hundreds of protesters were arrested as riot cops in the colony clashed with locals over a hardline new police state security bill.Meanwhile, Australias prime minister said he was also considering offering a safe haven for Hong Kongers.Scott Morrison said: The basic law and the safeguards that were put in place with the handover, we would expect to be upheld. I think thats a very reasonable position and a very consistent position for the government.We are considering very actively and there are proposals that I asked to be brought forward several weeks ago.One policeman was allegedly stabbed by a protester as the sweeping and repressive new Chinese security laws came into place yesterday.Protesters have been out on the streets in defiance of China, which just passed a law banning protests and demonstrations in the semi-autonomous city.Hundreds of people - including a -year-old girl who was waving a flag calling for independence - were arrested as cops used water cannons and tear gas to try and drive protesters back.One police officer was pictured with a blood soaked shirt after someone put an approximately one inch gash in his left shoulder.HK Police posted pictures on Twitter of the officer being given stitches, saying he was stabbed by “rioters holding sharp objects.”Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas on Wednesday to break up the first protest since China introduced sweeping security legislation.Hundreds of arrests have been made, their first under the new legislation while warning of punishment for calling for secession or subversion.The new law makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal.Anyone taking part in pro-independence activities, such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags, is in violation of the law.A man was detained for carrying a flag that called for independence, while a woman was also held for carrying a sign bearing the same message with a British flag.Beijing only unveiled the details of the much-anticipated law late on Tuesday after weeks of uncertainty and years of public protest and international condemnation.The former British territory is China’s freest city and one of the world’s most glittering financial hubs.However, the new law will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to le in prison.It will also see mainland security agencies in Hong Kong for the first time and allow for extradition to the mainland for trial.Wednesday saw thousands of protesters gathering downtown for an annual rally marking the anniversary of the handover to China in .“You are displaying flags or banners chanting slogans or conducting yourselves with an intent such as secession or subversion, which may constitute offenses under the national security law,” police said in a message displayed on a purple banner.Riot police used pepper spray and fired pellets as they made arrests after crowds spilled out into the streets chanting “resist till the end” and “Hong Kong independence”.Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was the most important development since the city’sto Chinese rule.“It is also an inevitable and prompt decision to restore stability,” Lam said at the harbour-front venue where  years ago the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, a staunch critic of the security law, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to Chinese rule.Some pro-Beijing officials and political commentators say the law is aimed at sealing Hong Kong’s “second ” to the motherland after the first failed to bring residents to heel.The move is a massive spit in the face of the British, who have promised refuge and citizenship to three million Hong Kong citizensChina strips them of their autonomy.Beijing has previously blasted the British offer as Cold War mentality.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have called for all new online games to be reviewed for their potential to cause harm and addiction and their appeal to children before they are approved. The minimum age to participate in gambling online should be raised to , it added. To help prevent suicide, GPs should be given guidance on asking patients with symptoms of anxiety and depression whether they have any gambling problems, and signposting them to help. Doctors should also be required to inform a coronerthey suspect a death by self-harm was gambling-related. The report also claims that tor each problem gambler there are six other people, some two million people, who suffer harm such as the breakup of families, crime, loss of employment, loss of homes and, ultimately, loss of le. The gambling industry spends £. billion a year on advertising, and % of its profits come from the % who are already problem gamblers or are at risk of becoming so.The report warns that since smartphones and laws which liberalised gambling has created a perfect storm of addictive  gambling.It blames successive governments and regulators for failing to keep up with the revolution in the UK gambling sector, which has seen gambling become unsupervised and available - online. Committee Chair Lord Grade of Yarmouth said that while most people who gamble enjoy it safely it still leads hundreds of people to take their own lives every year.  He added that gambling related-harm has made the lives of two million people miserable and called for urgent action. He said: The behaviour of some gambling operators, where vulnerable people were targeted with inducements to continue gambling when the operators knew they could not afford to, shocked the Committee.

It is understood the dentist lost his licence in  and slumped into a depression, taking his own le three years later. But the house looks asit hasnapost been touched since at least the decade before. A waiting room lies tidy, waiting for patients to enter, while the old dentist chair is still in place, complete with dental moulds, newspapers from  and medical books stacked high alongside patient records.  The urban explorer who visited said: Itaposs a huge mansion behind these ft black metal gates and itaposs very, very sinister looking. The dentist lived there with his we and kids and he was a regular dentist and GP and he had it all in his house. He got into financial trouble and his we left him. I was told he also lost his medical licence but did not tell his patients.  He went on: The neighbours said he used to do appointments for a third of the price of anyone  but was using -year-old equipment and thataposs why people complained. Bedrooms are filled with perfectly clean and folded bedlinen while a chandelier hangs above one bed. Hundreds of items of clothing are crammed into wardrobes alongside shoes that seem to be from the s or s. But the eeriest thing at the mansion in East Flanders is the dentistaposs room.  There were drills and pain relief, with an alternative to chloroform, said the urban explorer. The basement was absolutely full of medical books. And there was a lot of beautul stuff left. A letter dated from  appears to have been written to the dentistaposs cousins.  Even the manaposs hat was left on the arm of a chair in the marbled hallway. He apparently had no family and his body was found in the lounge in . No-one wants to buy it because of its history and the villagers want it demolished, he added.

German prosecutors suspect paedophile Christian Brueckner, now , abducted the three-year-old British girl from her familyaposs holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portugal, and murdered a short time later. New details about a phone call - involving a mobile number allegedly used by Brueckner and an unknown person - are set to be revealed on a German TV crime programme. Rudi Cerne, the host of Aktenzeichen XY… Ungelöst , told Focus: The call came from the same place where the little girl was last seen alive. I get the impression something important is happening now. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters previously said a phone allegedly used by Brueckner pinged on a mast at the Ocean Club apartment complex shortly before Madeleine disappeared. Christian Hoppe, an investigator with Germanyaposs Federal Criminal Police Office , is set to discuss new details about the McCann case when he appears on Mr Cerneaposs programme on Wednesday night. Last month, Mr Hoppe broke the news that police had identied a German man as the new chief suspect in Maddieaposs disappearance on the night of May , . German prosecutors say they have evidence Madeleine is dead and they are investigating Brueckner for murder, but they do not have enough evidence to charge their suspect as no body has been found.  Brueckner, who is in jail for drug trafficking and raping a -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz about  months before Madeleine vanished, has claimed through his lawyer he had no involvement in the McCann case. Mr Cerne gave a preview of what will be revealed on Wednesday nightaposs programme. He told Focus: The only thing I can say at the moment is that this also includes the telephone number of the Portuguese prepaid card that was called from the German suspectaposs cellphone. Not even an hour before Maddie disappeared. The call also came from the same place where the little girl was last seen alive, in Praia da Luz in the Algarve. Mr Cerne said he is very excited about what Mr Hoppe will reveal on the programme, which airs on the German TV station ZDF, after last monthaposs show generated hundreds of phone calls to investigators in Germany, the UK and Portugal. He added: I get the impression something important is happening now. He said detectivesapos appeal for help on Wednesday night will focus on the phone call and the mobile numbers that were involved. Mr Cerne said: Iaposm not an investigator. But I know that they work through every single clue, whatever it is. If you keep getting similar information over and over again, then you prick your ears up. That is why they are now looking for public help again.  Clearly this telephone number, which was called from the suspectaposs mobile phone shortly before Maddieaposs disappearance, has a very large role in the investigation. I would imagine the BKA would need all the information about who owned this prepaid number, who called it, who was called from it. Every little clue, however small, counts - and is processed. Police said previously that a phone linked to the suspect received a call that lasted  minutes between .pm and .pm, close to the Ocean Club about an hour before Madeleine disappeared.  The unknown caller, who is not thought to have been in the Praia da Luz area, is not being treated as a suspect, but is said to be a key witness. Earlier in the investigation, police took the unusual step of releasing two phone numbers from the call. The first phone number,  , is believed to have been used by the suspect. The number for the other Portuguese mobile was  . In a recent interview with  Minutes, Mr Wolters said a phone linked to Brueckner was used in the immediate area of the McCannsapos holiday flat the night she disappeared. Mr Wolters said the phone was connecting in the mast belonging to Ocean Club. Madeleine was last seen alive at the Ocean Club complex where her family, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was staying days before her fourth birthday. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, left her and her -month-old twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, sleeping alone while they had dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby.

The Duchess of Sussex also for the first time named five friends who criticized her dad, Thomas, after the pair had a spectacular falling out in the lead up to her May  nuptials. In a series of statements made in legal papers submitted to the High Court, the -year-old claimed her wedding raised £billion in tourist revenue. The papers say this “far outweighed” the contribution of taxpayersapos money towards crowd security. This figure has been previously doubted by consulting firm Brand Finance, MailOnline reports, with a figure of £million closer to the mark. Meghan also says she was prevented from defending herself against reports concerning the acrimonious relationship with her father, which left her friends “rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant” . The former actress is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedowner of The Mail On Sunday newspaper over five articles, which included reproduced parts of a handwritten note she had sent to her father in August . Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. In a major development this evening it emerged in confidential papers that Meghan not only identied her pals who spoke anonymously to People magazine, but insisted she didn’t know they were doing so.  Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. The friends have never been named, with the magazine only referring to them as “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. They are detailed as friends A, B, C, D and E in redacted documents but named in confidential papers submitted to the court. Meghan’s lawyers insist the Duchess “discussed with Friend A that she was writing a letter to her father at the time of penning itapos, which was seven months before the article was published in People in February .Legal experts predict the associates could now be called to testy in court during a sensational trial - dubbed “Markle versus Markle” expected at the end of the year or early . The documents state: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. At the beginning of May Associated Newspapers asked Mr Justice Warby to strike out the following allegations in Meghanaposs case: - That the defendant acted dishonestly and in bad faith. - That the defendant deliberately dug up or stirred up conflict between the claimant and her father. - That the claimant was distressed by the defendant’s “obvious agenda of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about [her] intended to portray her in a  and damaging light”.

But behind the white painted mask of Marcel Marceau was a story he never wanted to tell. Unknown to his legions of fans, he saved the lives of more than  Jewish children from the Holocaust, risking his le to take them across the Alps from France into Switzerland. Marcel’s remarkable story is told at last in Resistance, a new film in which he is played by Social Network star Jesse Eisenberg. Director Jonathan Jakubowicz knew Marcel as the performer who changed modern theatre and even inspired Michael Jackson’s moonwalk. But he admits he knew nothing about Marcel’s most incredible achievement until he began researching his le before writing the script. Jonathan says: “I had no idea that he was Jewish or that he saved children in the war, that he found his art through the very act of saving children. I felt likethat is the story behind him it needed to be told. “I was going to the Cannes Film Festival so I felt like since I’m going to France maybe I can meet some of the people involved in that story.” Marcel died in France in , aged , but Jonathan tracked down his cousin Georges Loinger, who headed the Jewish Boy Scouts of France and Jewish Resistance during the war.  Jonathan says: “He was at the centre of this whole network that ended up saving , children. He was the man who recruited Marcel to the Resistance.” Born Marcel Mangel, he and his father, a kosher butcher, mother and younger brother lived in Strasbourg, France, on the border with Germany. But while they could see the growing Nazi threat from across the border, Marcel at first ignored the rumbles of war and the growing threat to German Jews, instead continued pursuing his ambition to be a theatre performer and playwright. Laughing off disapproval from his father, Marcel would mime in theatres with a toothbrush moustache prop that could transform him into Charlie Chaplin – and Adolf Hitler.  But that all changed in  when, during Kristallnacht, rioters across Germany destroyed Jewish businesses and killed Jews in the street, leaving hundreds of children orphaned. A wealthy Strasbourg landowner “bought”  children orphaned in the slaughter from the Nazis and took them across the border to live in her chateau. She turned to Georges for help, and he recruited his cousin Marcel – simply to entertain and soothe the traumatised children. Jonathan says: “The Jewish Boy Scouts get a phone call from the woman asking for their help. So this very small, unprepared group of boy scouts suddenly had to take care of  orphans. They’re crying, they’re desperate and they are traumatised.  “They only had Yiddish as the common language because the kids were German and Austrian and these guys were French.” There was a huge language barrier and that’s when Georges, who died in , decided to ask his cousin Marcel Mangel to help. To Georges, Marcel was a clown, a performer, a mime, an actor, an artist. He wasn’t taken seriously. Jonathan says: Marcel reluctantly agreed to help them, and I found it really beautul how he completely changes. He goes from being an egotistical human being to a person who is truly devoted to saving the lives of these children. Unable to communicate with words, Marcel began using mime to help put the children at ease, first with a simple gesture that would later make him famous – a hand passed over his face from happy to sad and back again.  He then found ways to make them laugh, include a walk-against-the-wind routine that would later become his signature. When Hitler invaded France in , Marcel and the Jewish Boy Scouts fled with the children to Lyon, hiding with families in the city. In , Klaus Barbie was made head of the Gestapo in Lyon. Known as the Butcher of Lyon, he delighted in torturing and murdering Jews, children and members of the Resistance. Marcel and his brother forged documents to change the ages of French youths to make them too young to be sent to labour camps or, in the case of the non-Jewish children, to work in German factories.  He also changed his own surname from the Jewish Mangel to the French Marceau. As Jews in the city started to be rounded up, the Jewish Resistance decided to get the orphaned children to safety in Switzerland. Marcel led the children across the Alps on three trips. He used his mime and clowning to calm them when their papers were checked by the Nazi soldiers. Jonathan says: “Growing up in Strasbourg he knew German, so he taught the children German songs. It helped that he could talk to the soldiers in their own language.  “He was incredibly courageous. Switzerland had this law that said they weren’t accepting refugees, butyou were a child refugee and you made it to Switzerland they wouldn’t report you because it was a neutral country. “Once they were there, Save the Children would claim them. It was a safe haven so the whole effort was to get them there without the Nazis stopping them.” Jonathan says: “Marcel was involved in three operations at the beginning but the rest of the operation of the Jewish Boy Scouts together with Save the Children saved , children.” Marcel’s father Charles was caught by the Gestapo and killed in Auschwitz in .  Jonathan says: “The most moving story I heard is that Marcel tracked down where his father was sent, but nobody knew what Auschwitz was. He would sit and wait for the train that came back from Poland to seehis father would come back from this place.” After the war, Marcel became the most famous mime in the world, creating Bip, a melancholy clown with a white face, striped jumper and battered hat with limp flower. After success on the US stage and television in the mid-s, he performed Bip internationally for decades. His work inspired numerous stars, from actor Gary Cooper to magician David Copperfield. Michael Jackson famously asked him to create “the choreography of my lost childhood” and Marcel’s sketch Walking Against the Wind inspired Jackson’s moonwalk.

Spice Girl Mel C and former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs joined other famous faces including singers Olly Murs and Bruno Mars in the challenge. Wheels For Heroes is a fantastic new project - launched by Brompton Bike Hire - to provide bikes to key workers. When Brompton Bike Hire stalled during lockdown, the firm pivoted to provide hundreds of bicycles for key workers who were worried about taking public transport. Brompton was approached by St Barts hospital, who askedthey could lend bikes to their staff so they supplied .  But that quickly escalated and within  days they’d leant out  for free. CEO Will Butler-Adams explains: “So then we thought: ‘We’re in the middle of a crisis, we’ve got to do something.

Imperial College Londonaposs Professor Neil Ferguson, who was a government adviser at the start of the pandemic, says it is only a matter of time until more places impose local lockdowns as Leicester has done following a spike of Covid- cases. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. And it is feared both Doncaster and Bradford could both see similar lockdowns following a worrying rise in the number of cases. Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Itaposs inevitable we will , we are relaxing lockdown rules and that means that contacts in the population are going up and thataposs a very iable process. Asked about Bradford and Doncaster, he said: Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per , of the population, which is the relevant measure, so theyaposre clearly of concern. Oxford Universityaposs Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group , also thinks England should expect more local lockdowns. Unfortunately I think we should, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.  Doncaster reported two more coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, taking the death toll in the South Yorkshire town to . Figures show there were  new  coronavirus  cases in Doncaster between June -, which more than doubled the following week. Between June -,  new infections in the town were confirmed, taking the total to . Doncaster was the only place in South Yorkshire to record new coronavirus deaths yesterday and is second behind Leicester as an area that has seen a worrying spike.  But, Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health at Doncaster Council, said he is not concerned about any potential lockdown in the town. “More data is now becoming available nationally and this will be open to scrutiny and speculation, he said. Since the reporting of both pillar  and pillar  testing we have seen a high number of positive cases beginning with the week th to st May and this coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identied a number of asymptomatic positive cases. We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week th -th June shows a signicant reduction.  We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested. We are working closely with the local Public Health England centre which has not raised any concerns with us.

Between -mm of rain is expected to fall in just  hours ruining plans for those hoping to enjoy a pint in a beer garden. Saturday morning will start off with strong winds and downpours before becoming heavier throughout the day and eventually easing off in the evening. The news comes as pubs, bars and restaurants across England will be allowed to reopen on Saturday after the government ordered them to close on March  to stop the spread of coronavirus.But the wet weather means pubs will struggle to adhere to social distancing measures as drinkers stay inside to avoid being drenched.Coronavirus infection rates are believed to be higher in inside spaces.Despite the rain England will remain humid, with maximum temperatures of C in London and the South East, and highs of C in central and northern parts of England. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said this is due to a low-pressure weather system near the UK, and although the rain will lessen towards the end of Saturday, low cloud and drizzly conditions will continue through to Sunday.She said: Saturday will see more unsettled conditions, with showers beginning in the west during the morning which will begin to move across to the east. While it wonapost be unusually wet for the time of year, some areas in the east could become particularly heavy for an hour or two in the mid-morning to early afternoon. Pushing in after that will be a spell of drizzly downpours and some low cloud which will hang over the UK for the rest of the day. A spokesman from JD Wetherspoon, which plans to reopen all  of its venues on Saturday, said: The weather is out of our control, but our pubs tend to be three times larger than others so we are not worried about people being inside our venues. We canapost predict what the weather will be like in England, but we have faith that our customers and staff will be as safe as possible.  A spokesperson for Stonegate Pubs, which owns The Slug and Lettuce chain, added: Throughout our pubs and bars, we are implementing clear, safe socialising measures both inside and across our outside spaces. We are encouraging customers to pre-book and all bookings work on a time-limit which enables us to manage capacity and customer expectation.

This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.” A statement from the pub reads: As our pubs reopen, our focus will be on meeting social distancing requirements and keeping our customers and staff safe. For this reason and to avoid crowds congregating, no football or sporting events will be shown on our TVs during July.

The disturbing incident took place in the city of Piripa, Brazil, just  days after twins Anne and Analu were born. Local media reports their mother Elaine Novais heard a sound coming from the room the twins were in while chatting to a neighbour. She was horried to find a their family dog attacking her daughters. She managed to rip the dog off them and called a family friend who is a nurse to help the tots. Mrs Novais, a council worker who had struggled to conceive for nine years, pulled the violent dog away from the twins, but it had already inflicted fatal damage on their abdomens.  She gave the girls first aid before they were taken to Maria Pedreira Barbosa Municipal Hospital, with doctors saying one of the girls was declared on arrival, whilst the other was in a serious condition. Doctors tried all they could but could not save the second girl’s le. The doctor at the hospital who was responsible for Elaine during her pregnancy said the mother had always shown adequate care for her babies.  The local council said in a statement: Faced with this immeasurable loss, we express our condolences and sympathy with parents Elaine and Regis, and their friends and family in this moment of sadness and pain. May God comfort your hearts and give you the strength to transform all the pain of this irreparable loss into faith and hope. The local authorities have said they do not plan to launch an investigation into the incident.  An unnamed family member told local media the dog - believed to be a Labrador cross -  was normally docile. We think that with the birth of the twins, the animal was left out in a way, and it no longer had the attention and affection of its owners provided before.

The line I had pasta tonight is not someone who is talking about what they had for dinner but is instead a cry for help. Other phrases used include I finished my shampoo and conditioner at the same time and are often used by TikTok users. One Reddit user believes the words have been taken from Hannah Dainsapos poem aposDonapost Kill Yourself Todayapos, which explains why a person struggling with depression should choose to stay alive. One line reads “finish your shampoo and conditioner at the same time” and another says to “tell someone your best pasta recipe.” Although some TikTok users actually talk about pasta or shampoo, many others post about these items for completely dferent reasons. But the comments to these meaningful posts can be powerful. One TikTok video captioned “Told my mom about my favorite pasta recipe and she made it for dinner tonight” received over three million views and , comments — all of which can be summed up by one user’s comment: “This comment section is my new therapy. Thank you.” “You’re so loved,” one person replied. “You haven’t come this far to only come this far,” another posted.“I love you all so much it’s beyond words,” the poster commented. “Thank you so much.

He is a victim of this global pandemic.“It is a tough one for me and the players but it is even tougher for Jimmy and Cammy, who has also left the club.“It is an absolute gutter for the two of them. But no one could have predicted how this virus would affect clubs like ours.”The Dark Blues are all but certain to promote first-team coach Dave Mackay to take over as number two but no decision has been made yet.McPake made the point that he has other things on his mind right now.“I think it is too early to say what will happen,” said McPake.“Thatis not what’s in my head just now.“What I am thinking about is losing members of staff due to cost-cutting measures.”McPake yesterday confirmed he will not be involved in pay cut talks between the club and its players.The Dark Blues’ squad members have been asked to agree to salary reductions of around % and while Meekings said no and headed off to pastures new, experienced midfielder Paul McGowan has gone the other way and agreed to stay.McPake stressed it will be up to iniduals to do what is best for themselves and their families, and the pay discussions will be done at managing director level by John Nelms.He said: “I can confirm that there have been talks about deductions but that’s for iniduals and that’s way above me.“That’s something that I am not really involved in and, evenI were, it wouldn’t be fair for me to speak about as we are talking about people’s livelihoods and salaries.“Cuts have been offered but what each inidual’s cut is, that’s private between them and whoever is dealing with it at the club.“It will just be inidualised. Theymay come back to the club with dferent ideas, I don’t know.“They might all come back and say yes or they might say no. It is a tough one for me to predict and, as for a deadline, I genuinely don’t know.”Askedthe coaching staff had also been asked to take a pay cut, the Dens boss replied: “That’s not something I will go into.”As for Meekings, there were definitely no hard feelings towards the defender from his now former gaffer.McPake added: “Meeks is gone and that’s a shame because he did great for me as captain of this club.“He was offered a deal and it was his choice to say whether it was acceptable or not.“He chose to reject it but I wish him well for the future.“It is sad to see him go but I fully understand decisions that people make, particularly under the circumstances we are in with the pandemic.“I have no bad words to say about him at all.”On a brighter note, McPake was understandably upbeat regarding McGowan’s decision to say yes to his new terms.He said: “I am delighted that he committed himself to the club.“Gowser is a leader without even realising he is a leader.“He might moan a lot on the pitch at times but that is because he has high standards and he is often the one to express an opinion when he thinks the players are not hitting those high standards.“At times like these, you need people with character at your club and Gowser certainly has that.“He never shirks responsibility and that is why he has such real affinity with the Dundee fans.“I think the talks with him were over and done within a day or so.

For example, as well as linen and towel changes, our teams will freshen all in-room amenities for new guests – from toiletries to tea and coffee to the addition of packs of antibacterial wipes.#And we’ll keep rooms free of non-essential items but will still have these to hand on request. We’ll even be including welcome packs in each room for guests, with hand sanitiser and PPE.“We also recognise that, particularly in the current circumstances, plans can change quickly, so we’re making a flexible booking rate available to allow free last-minute cancellations, and we continue to offer the best available rates to those booking direct via our website.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He really liked the club and the region where the club are based. It was just a good fit between the club and Steve himself.#Our area in Holland is full of people who are down to earth and Steve loved that. He#d gone from the pressure of getting the sack from England and all the attention that carried with it, to a small region in the east of Holland which is very quiet and he relished that.#The club was well run and well organised. You can ask anyone in Enschede and they all have nothing but positive things to say about Steve.#Hopefully, it will be the same with him and Dundee United too.#Brama says McClaren wouldn’t go into Tannadice and make wholesale changes – and he raved about the former Middlesbrough manager#s man-management skills.He recalled: #Steve had two periods with us as manager and, of course, he won us the league for the first time in our history in his first time at the club.#Him being manager made it a very, very positive experience for me.#When he first came in, the important thing for him was not to change everything straight away. In the beginning, he didn#t change a lot of things, he just observed.#He also didn#t bring in his own coaches, he kept the very good Dutch coaches we had at the club. He had Erik ten Hag, who is now Ajax manager, at the club as a coach and Alfred Schreuder as his assistant manager, who went on to manage Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.#So he used the coaches who were there and their knowledge and allowed the coaches here to do their job without interference and that certainly helped too.#He was a great manager for us. He was liked and respected by the players, coaches, everyone at the club in a very good way. He was the boss and everyone knew it.#For me as a player, he was fantastic. I was out of the team when Steve arrived because there were two new players who were in my position.#But he played me in a game against Arsenal in Europe when he needed a more defensive midfielder and I played just about every game since then.#He could trust me. I was only  at the time and I liked that he showed enough confidence in me as a young player to discuss tactics with me.#It was a very Dutch way to work and it was another example of how he adapted. He wanted to integrate with the Dutch way of playing, training and thinking and that#s what made him a big success.#Hopefully, he will be as big a success at Dundee United as he was at Twente.#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-malky-mackay-dundee-united embed # secretlLVCwFjUQ\" data-secret\"lLVCwFjUQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

GP, and being wrongly diagnosed with ADHD and autism, he was eventually confirmed as having Tourettersquos at the age of seven.Nearly  per cent of people who seek treatment for Tourettersquos will be diagnosed with a second psychiatric disorder during their letimes, according to researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital.Due to the complicated nature of the syndrome, misdiagnoses are common, and the process of finding a correct diagnosis for Jack took several years.And although the rest of his school days were slightly easier and his school was cooperative, Jack faced other issues.Undertaking a series of drug trials from the ages of eight to , he lost three stone in a year ndash making him dangerously underweight.ldquoThe medication made me feel so low and lethargic all the time and came with horrendous side effects,\" he said.ldquoI had no personality and was reduced to skin and bone.\"One gave me breasts, and one made me drool all the time.A  study in Biological Psychiatryrevealed that Tourettersquos sufferers are four times more likely than the general population to die by suicide, with mental health problems having a ldquosevere impact on their daily lives.With the constant attention being directed towards him due to his physical and vocal tics, Jackrsquos own mental health took a turn for the worse during secondary school.When using public transport, Jack would always sit at the back to avoid all eyes being on him.Most of his tics are quite physical, which meant his anxiety would sky-rocket when he was out in public.After being diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and depression, even leaving the house became too much at times.ldquoTourettersquos infiltrates every part of your le, Jack said.ldquoIt got to the stage that every time I left the house, I would come back crying because of bullying or horrible comments.ldquoMy main problems arenrsquot because of my tics. Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"primary-school-galashiels-records-bruno-mars-cover","story":"A GALASHIELS primary school has recorded its own version of a Bruno Mars song to mark the

flights to European countries are expected to resume from next month in a bid to kick-start the tourist economy.This is what you need to know about air bridges and travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to

passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing

her during their marriage In a last-ditch attempt to derail the High Court trial, due to start next Tuesday, NGNrsquos legal team had asked Mr Justice Nicol to strike out Mr Depprsquos claim.Adam Wolanski QC argued the Hollywood star was in ldquoserious breach of a court order because he had not given NGNrsquos legal team what he referred to as the ldquoAustralia drugs texts between Mr Depp and his assistant, Nathan Holmes.Mr Justice Nicol found on Monday that Mr Depp had breached an ldquounless order requiring him to disclose documents from separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US ndash which include the text messages.However, in a ruling on Thursday, the judge said he would grant Mr Depprsquos application for ldquorelief from sanctions, meaning the trial will go ahead as planned.The judge said his decision was conditional on Mr Depp giving an undertaking that he will not seek sanctions against Ms Heard for allegedly breaching a court order, made during separate libel proceedings in the US, by providing The Sunrsquos legal team with evidence.vw,vw,px, px\"Amber Heard and Johnny Depp married in Los Angeles in February  During a hearing last week, Mr Wolanski said the messages, sent in late February and early March  ndash shortly before an alleged incident in Australia between Mr Depp and Ms Heard, which she claims was ldquoa three-day ordeal of physical assaults ndash demonstrated that Mr Depp was trying to get drugs during the Australia visit.He told the court that references to ldquohappy pills and ldquowhitey stuff showed Mr Depp was trying to obtain MDMA and cocaine, which he argued was ldquoprofoundly damaging to his case.The alleged incident in Australia is one of  separate allegations of domestic violence, between early  and May , that NGN relies on in its pleaded defence to Mr Depprsquos claim.Mr Justice Nicol refused an application by Mr Depprsquos legal team for an order requiring Ms Heard to disclose evidence, including a covert audio recording made of a conversation between herself and her former husband in July .The actor had also asked for ldquoall communications between Ms Heard and a contact saved in her phone as

supposed paranoia and mistaken belief that she was having affairs that caused him to be violent.However, rejecting the application, Mr Justice Nicol said: ldquoThe central issue for the defence of truth is whether Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard.ldquoEvenshe had been unfaithful to him, that would be irrelevant on that central issue.ldquoI am not therefore persuaded that these categories of documents

have seen large gatherings of youths, sometimes more than  at a time, at ious locations around the county.The vast majority of these are all well behaved but a small minority have been engaging in signicant anti-social behaviourand disorder.North Berwick, Tranent and Longniddry have caused us some issues recently, with intoxicated youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

The tedium of inactivity or boredom for some, while for others, the demands or dficulties of family le or work has made for a testing and trying time.Many have turned to prayer and to Godrsquos word at this time, trusting that God knows our plight and hears our cry and has things to say to us in his word, the bible.We can trust in our politicians, scientic advisors and our NHS staffbut even they have their human limitations.To believe in a higher and sovereign hand upon us makes all the dference.The writer of the psalmsin the bible says: lsquoI trust in you, O Lord.

We know that the children being worst hit by this time out of school are those from the least privileged backgrounds.The council is working to try to get children back to school but the current government proposals are not acceptable.They aim for the majority of primary schools to have  per cent of pupils attending at any one time and some primary schools to have only  per cent of pupils attending at a time.In our high schools it is a similar story of, at best, having only  per cent of pupils attending at any one time.Part of the issue is that Scottish Government guidance on two-metre social distancing massively limits the number of children who can be in class at any one time.Of course, as we have seen this week, confusion exists in the government as to how education will be delivered in the long term any- way.John Swinney explained that the proposed blended learning arrangements are likely to last for most of the next academic year, only for Nicola Sturgeon to suggest these proposals are merely a contingency plan.This uncertainty creates many dficulties as we plan.For example, how do we get children to school from home The council currently provides transport to get children to schools but, as stands, it will not be sufficient and will need to be radically increased in scope.Council officers suggest that this could mean the cost ballooning to ldquoin excess of pound. million and therefore well beyond existing resource levels, in part due to the two-metre social distancing requirement.But, even with a smaller distance, there will still be signicant dficulty in our schools.We should look at utilising other public buildings such as community centres and sports halls for education purposes.However, this then comes to the crux of the matter: there are signicant resourcing issues with reopening schools.The Scottish Government has asked councils and schools to operate and act in new and radical ways but has not come forward in a meaningful way to assist them.The Scottish Government must help us fund the cost of transporting children to school and help to fund the opening up of other public buildings.Providing an education to our children here in East Lothian needs to be among our very highest priorities.That is why my Conservatives colleagues on the councilrsquos education committee, which is meeting this week, will be pushing officers to try to get children back in school sooner and quicker."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-east-linton-enjoys-stay-home-gala","story":"The gala committee were forced to cancel the annual day, due to take place on Saturday, June , but decided instead to hold a socially distant event instead.With the theme of Masquerade, locals decorated their homes and planned to have picnics in their gardens and wear masks.Sadly the rain meant most picnics were unable to go ahead but the local fire crew arrived and drove through the village streets handing out treats provided by the committee.Children were encouraged to draw pictures of a fire engine and put them on display at their homes to attract the firefighters attention and families turned out to wave to the crew with some some lucky youngsters even given the chance to climb into the fire engine cab.Station Commander David Ward, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: ldquoWe were delighted that members of our crew at East Linton Fire Station could take part in their community gala.\"With so many gala days and local events cancelled, itrsquos great to see people come together in this way to try and create something positive for the local community, and children especially.

Some pupils may have learnt new skills and may be rethinking their path because of new experiences and we look forward to hearing about those experiences.ldquoMore importantly, we look forward to welcoming our children back to school and are excited to see them again in August.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos wellbeing, praised the efforts of parents, carers and teaching staff during lockdown.She said: ldquoStaff across our schools especially our headteachers have been working tirelessly and around the clock to pull together plans based on government advice.ldquoMany parents and carers will be pleased to hear that schools will be going back full-time in August.

moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs

with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Irsquove argued for years that, come independence, the SNP would fracture and many of its supporters would revert to the parties where their political sympathies naturally lie. I write this as someone who was a Labour Party activist, and indeed candidate, but who recognised that the Parliament at Westminster will never deliver the sort of Scotland Irsquod like my grandkids to grow up in.Mr Brown says that Jeremy Corbyn made the Labour Party unelectable. Actually, it started rather earlier: remember Ed Miliband and his Ed Stone  Itrsquos too early to tell whether Sir Keir Starmer will save Labour, but hersquos very much a metropolitan elite archetype, so I donrsquot have much hope of him delivering for Scotland. Mr Brown believes that Sir Keirrsquos rise will be helped by Boris Johnsonrsquos decline. He clearly doesnrsquot recognise the Conservative Partyrsquos ruthlessness when it comes to holding onto power. If they think their leader hinders them, they act fast, as Mrs Thatcher found out.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.AT long last Bill Brown has come out of the long grass and nailed his colours to the mast. It now appears that he had lent his vote in December  to Jo Swinson, hoping to keep the SNP out of East Dunbartonshire. His intemperate reaction in these pages to her defeat tagged SNP voters, myself included, with an incredible list of uncomplimentary adjectives. Now he warns us that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state, that party presumably being the SNP.He must rate the intelligence of Herald readers as no better than that of SNP votershe expects such a ridiculous prediction to be taken seriously. His vision of a Labour landslide in the next UK General Election might well be a credible possibility, but Labours chances of winning in an independent Scotland are just as real,not better. The glue which binds SNP voters would lose its grip after independence and the party would quickly disintegrate or wither away, in stark contrast to Mr Browns one-party state.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.MARK Smithopines on three groups of voters he identies as resistant to voting Yes in the next independence referendum. He is convinced an unholy alliance of Labour unionists, free market Brexiters and the middle classes will combine to thwart Scotland achieving independence.That sounds like an interesting construct for Better Together .. The rump of Scottish Labour knows any repeat of its disastrous association with the Tories in  cannot happen, no matter what Sir Keir Starmer thinks. Similarly, middle class Scottish Tories are overwhelmingly pro-EU and, having lost their leader and more than half their MPrsquos while ldquoGet Brexit Done resonated in Westminster, they will be lukewarm at least to joining any referendum campaign predicated on a pro-Brexit message.I fear Mr Smith has picked up the wrong end of the stick. It would perhaps have been more pertinent to have addressed why there is now a sustained movement to majority support for independence. The six years since the first referendum have been a cumulative series of missteps by unionists ndash from David Cameronrsquos pronouncements in Downing Street the morning after the vote to the folly of Brexit and the deceit of the Johnson Cummings administration.The Covid- pandemic has been devastating throughout the UK. However, it has given Scottish voters a unique opportunity to compare the performance of the Scottish and Westminster governments in dealing with the same existential threat. By any measure, whether leadership, communication, or virus suppression, Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have convincingly outperformed Boris Johnson and his cohorts.This has not gone unnoticed by Mr Smithrsquos middle-class voters who have drawn their own conclusions about the competence of the two governments. Faced with a choice of a Brexit UK under the direction of Mr Johnson or an independent Scotland within the EU they are increasingly receptive to the latter proposition.Iain Gunn, Elgin.WITH all the talk of closing the border with the rest of the UK, I was wondering: is it just English people that the SNP wants to keep out, or would the extra billions of pounds that it is begging for from the UK Government also be turned back at Berwick Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.REBECCA McQuillanwrites that the UK Government is ldquoirresponsibly pushing ahead with Brexit.

Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe.

Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe.

This is a far less serious matter than his becoming Cabinet Secretary. It has few,any, constitutional implications. I worked for a previous incumbent for a couple of years.

That could be work for a trusted political appointee.:Agenda: Proposed new law could make JK Rowling a criminalIs it a good appointment  That is a more subjective question, and less fundamental. Mr Frostrsquos predecessors have been very senior diplomats, with deep grounding across Britainrsquos foreign policy and security concerns ndash former heads of the Diplomatic Service, Ambassadors in Washington, Paris, Permanent Representatives in Brussels, both to the EU and to Nato. Some have done more than one of these big jobs, in wide, senior international careers.Mr Frost is able and, importantly, has the Prime Ministerrsquos confidence. But his diplomatic career culminated in the important, but not central, ambassadorship to Denmark. He then ran the important, but not central, Scotch Whisky Association, and was special advisor to Mr Johnson, as a Foreign Secretary who earned mixed reviews. Judging Mr Frostrsquos role as chief Brexit negotiator may be premature. But it is odd, after the justied criticism of Sir Mark Sedwillrsquos being both Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, that Mr Frost should have to combine the climax of Brexit negotiations with whatever Middle Eastern politics, for instance, or terrorism, may serve up in the coming months.Choosing the new Cabinet Secretary matters more.

They might agree with her, too, that feminism has tended to look down on womenwho choose to stay at home and care for children rather than join the  to .Admittedly, it can sometimes feel as though the only gains to have been made in feminism are surface ones, easily erased when times get tough. It has often been that way: see the two world wars.

If this is progress it looks dishearteningly modest.Yet I also see the likes of the #MeToo movement and think of old Harvey behind bars. I see women going to court to enforce their employment rights. I see them speaking up, determined not to take the same sexist nonsense we often did. Saying you are not a feminist today is distinctly uncool.

I believe it would be hugely positive for Scotland to see a big increase in social enterprises, whose profits are reinvested for the benefit of society and the environment. Similarly, I would like to see a big growth in co-operatives it could be very useful and informative to look at the successes and achievements of the Mondragon Corporation, which was born in the Basque Country, and now has a presence on five continents.

Theatres, music venues, galleries and museums and independent cinemas are all vital to the soul of the nation.Cathy Benson, Edinburgh EH.RECENTLY Herald columnists have taken to comparing the response to the coronavirus crisis of the Scottish Government and governments where in the UK, especially that of England. Recent developments provide them with further ammunition.On the one hand we have Boris Johnson proclaiming a New Deal comparable with that implemented by Franklin Roosevelt in the US in the s. Leaving aside for the moment the fact that Roosevelts programme was far greater in scope than that proposed by Mr Johnson ., what is interesting is that a Tory leader should come forward with such a series of measures in the first place. Where are the calls for a small state  Where are the calls for free markets  What has happened to the Masters of the Universe in the City of London Sir Tom Hunter appears to take a dferent view and, in terms of his economic principles, a more consistent one. In Scotland business must come to the fore and the rest of civil society marginalised with no apparent role or voice for, among others, universities, trade unions, environmental campaigners, political parties or the myriad of pressure groups which campaign on many key issues. It is not, I have to say, a prospect I find appealing.Before the crash in America with soup kitchens and \"bread lines knee deep in wheat\" there was a slogan, \"The Business of America is Business\". Scotland should strive for a broader, more rounded and inclusive view.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TO put Boris Johnsonrsquos pound billion ldquoNew Deal package into some context, the UK Government is spending pound billion to refurbish the Palace of Westminster, including pound million for a House of Lords rooftop restaurant.Norway, which has produced roughly  per cent more oil and gas than Scotland, plans to spend a record  billion kronerof its sovereign oil wealth fund this year to weather the brutal Covid- downturn and announced a Government Bond Fund providing up to NOK  billionto be invested in bonds issued by Norwegian companies.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.BORIS Johnsonrsquos Recovery Plan is certainly modest incorporating an investment of poundbn when compared to the probable cost of HS at poundbn as predicted by a Government review in Jan . With the changing circumstances brought about by Covid-, how can this project still be justied especially as one of the outcomes of the pandemic may well be less travel and more working from home  These two sums of money are outrageously out of perspective with the needs of the British people at present.Stewart Jamieson, Dumfries.BORIS Johnson is among the most amiable of men, with the gt of the gab. However, his honeyed words seldom come to fruition. His latest speech on his ldquoNew Deal spending plan appears to be no more than fluff shuffling the same pack of cards not one extra penny of spending for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, but then, Mr Johnson always promises more than he delivers. And,he had referenced ldquoEngland instead of ldquoUK, it would have been just the same speech.Under the guise of ldquoreform he is also getting rid of the most senior civil servant and National Security Advisor and replacing him with a political appointee. It used to be a commonly shared belief that the impartiality of the civil service was a jewel in the crown of the British State. Thus, for Tory party advantage, the foundations of that British state get a wee bit more shoogly, and our common ldquoSocial Contract less relevant.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon says she is \"extremely underwhelmed\" by Boris Johnsons economic recovery plan. She needs to look a little closer to home.Whilst her efforts to keep Scots healthy are laudable, her efforts on the economy are far less so, her latest gaffe being damaging the already hard-pressed tourist industry. Kate Forbes, her Finance Secretary, has had to \" request\" extra financial aid from Westminster but this is not helped by the general attitude of the SNP that suggests any refusal will simply be another reason to go for independence.Our current SNP Green government is far too blinded by this prospect to actually notice the reality that,Scotland actually voted for independence, then there are no viable answers to running the finances successfully. Talk is cheap, nothing  is.Ms Sturgeon must stop governing by spurious poll results and deal with the real situation on the ground. Currently we have almost no productive economy to speak of but rapidly rising costs and debts. If Scotland is going to be an independent country soon, then there should be no need to ask Westminster for money. Surely we ought to be demonstrating our own \"economic powerhouse\" abilities right now with the multitude of powers we already possess.

The help should be extended to include not only the most-high risk but also those who are situationally vulnerable and have so far been sidelined.This would mean that central and local governments will need to accurately assess and identy which consumers remain vulnerable so that they can also be given access to appropriate support such as priority supermarket delivery slots or local food provision through other means.:Edinburgh womanwho has battled cervical cancer and brain tumours fronts new UK-wide Cancer Research fundraising appealSue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which  said:ldquoIt is a real concern that months into lockdown, the current system of food provision is still not working for so many of those who need it the most.

We’ve been inspired by the care and support members of that community give each other – the comradeship they share is truly a bond of friendship beyond what is typical in civilian le.“During the coronavirus outbreak many veterans’ charities and community groups have created opportunities for veterans to enjoy comradeship using video-conferencing apps.#Our big concern is for those older veterans who are unable or prefer not to use the internet, and so miss out on these opportunities.“Through Comradeship Circles they can now enjoy banter and share memories of military le with each other by phone, in groups of up to six for about an hour, at the same time and on the same day each week.#One of our facilitators will be on hand just in case, but mostly will leave the veterans to speak to each other.”Age Scotland are hoping the Comradeship Circles project will create opportunities for veterans to ‘re-join the tribe’ by telephone.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From helping to build Nightingale Hospitals to delivering essential supplies to those who are shielding, they have helped thousands of people across the country. We take a look at how one such veteran is helping out.This is not the first time former soldier Joshua Ryder has seen a pandemic close up, having volunteered to visit Sierra Leone during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. The -year-old worked in what was known as a “red zone” in Kerry Town,  miles from capital Freetown.As a member of Royal Army Medical Core, he worked as a combat medical technician, receiving awards for Top Trainee and Adult Learner of the Year.Joshua said: “We treated patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola. The symptoms are similar to those of malaria and gastroenteritis. “We triaged and tested patients to determine whether they had these or Ebola.”The West African outbreak began in , ending in Sierra Leone in .Two-and-a-half years after the first case was discovered, the outbreak resulted in more than , cases with , deaths. vw, px\"  Such was the volatility of the strain – most widespread outbreak of the disease in history – Joshua was only allowed to work in the area for  days.He said: “I loved the country. It has some beautul sights and the people are really friendly. “It was sad to see the devastation caused by the pandemic. We didn’t only focus on the pandemic. We visited orphanages and helped build something for the country.“It was moving to see the children who lost their parents to the virus.”During the coronavirus outbreak he is again working, but the environment could not be more dferent.Having left the army in , he is now a trainee nursing associate on a Midlands Partnership NHS Trust acute mental health ward in Stafford.Joshua, who is father to Tia, aged , and her -year-old sister Lola, said: “Day to day I am more involved with the physical well-being of the patients – calming them, making physical observations, doing ECGs and bloods. “I go to Keele University one day a week and am due to start my second year in September.”It was Joshua’s experiences and expertise in the army that led him to the NHS in general, and mental health in particular.He said: “I have worked in demanding conditions in ious locations around the world. I am adaptable to suit many environments and job roles.” vw, px\"  In the military he saw firsthand soldiers suffering poor mental health. One of his friends, also serving in the army, committed suicide.He said: “I entered the NHS through the Step into Health programme, which has been brilliant.“I have been able to prove myself and have had really positive feedback.“I won an award for Outstanding Impact Since Joining the NHS at the programme’s first ceremony.”Joshua is helping to treat patients through more dficult times than usual.“We are doing absolutely brilliantly,” he said. “It would be abnormal, with all the constant changes,we did not experience stress and anxiety.“We have adapted and made changes.“Here our patients have been brilliant.“We have got a good team here, a good mix of people with dferent skills. We all support each other and do everything we can for our patients.”Joshua has also been a volunteer with men’s mental health charity Men Unite, supporting males in crisis.He ran a half marathon last year to raise £ for Mental Health UK.“And this month I am running  miles, having so far raised £ for the same charity through JustGiving.” he said.Former service personnel have helped dferent communities deal with all manner of problems, making urgent deliveries of food and medicines to vulnerable people while also helping those who are shielding receive what they need.Many others have helped ensure those who need a test for the virus have been able to get one by setting up mobile testing sites, allowing them to run smoothly and safely to daily test thousands of people with symptoms.A lot of this work has required specic skills our veterans have learnt throughout years of military service.The work of these veterans goes to show the military gives you key skills, transferable to civilian le – be it healthcare, business or organisation.Veterans form an important part of our NHS workforce and, throughout COVID-, many more have come forward to support the continued fight against this pandemic.Working across a iety of roles, both on and off the frontline, the NHS has benefitted from their military expertise and experiences, invaluable at this challenging time.From redesigning hospital departments to safely supporting virus and non-virus patients, to providing care for those in Nightingale Hospitals and supporting nurses using military mental health resilience techniques, vets have once again served our country with pride.This is in addition to many who have continued to work in dedicated NHS services for ex-service personnel, such as Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service to ensure care and treatment remains available throughout this period, virtually or via phone. vw, px\"  Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer, pictured right, said: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. “We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

following a High Court ruling.The -year-old actor is suing the tabloidrsquos publisher, News Group Newspapers , and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an April  article which referred to Mr Depp as a ldquowe beater.The article related to allegations made against Mr Depp by actress Ms Heard, , that he was violent towards her during their marriage ndash claims he strenuously denies. vw,vw,px, px\"Amber Heard alleges that Johnny Depp was violent towards her during their marriage In a last-ditch attempt to derail the High Court trial, due to start next Tuesday, NGNrsquos legal team had asked Mr Justice Nicol to strike out Mr Depprsquos claim.Adam Wolanski QC argued the Hollywood star was in ldquoserious breach of a court order because he had not given NGNrsquos legal team what he referred to as the ldquoAustralia drugs texts between Mr Depp and his assistant, Nathan Holmes.Mr Justice Nicol found on Monday that Mr Depp had breached an ldquounless order requiring him to disclose documents from separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US ndash which include the text messages.However, in a ruling on Thursday, the judge said he would grant Mr Depprsquos application for ldquorelief from sanctions, meaning the trial will go ahead as planned.The judge said his decision was conditional on Mr Depp giving an undertaking that he will not seek sanctions against Ms Heard for allegedly breaching a court order, made during separate libel proceedings in the US, by providing The Sunrsquos legal team with evidence. vw,vw,px, px\"Amber Heard and Johnny Depp married in Los Angeles in February  During a hearing last week, Mr Wolanski said the messages, sent in late February and early March  ndash shortly before an alleged incident in Australia between Mr Depp and Ms Heard, which she claims was ldquoa three-day ordeal of physical assaults ndash demonstrated that Mr Depp was trying to get drugs during the Australia visit.He told the court that references to ldquohappy pills and ldquowhitey stuff showed Mr Depp was trying to obtain MDMA and cocaine, which he argued was ldquoprofoundly damaging to his case.The alleged incident in Australia is one of  separate allegations of domestic violence, between early  and May , that NGN relies on in its pleaded defence to Mr Depprsquos claim.Mr Justice Nicol refused an application by Mr Depprsquos legal team for an order requiring Ms Heard to disclose evidence, including a covert audio recording made of a conversation between herself and her former husband in July .The actor had also asked for ldquoall communications between Ms Heard and a contact saved in her phone as ldquoRocketman, who Mr Depp claims is SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, and between her and actor James Franco. vw,vw,px, px\"Johnny Depprsquos former partner Winona Ryder is expected to give evidence David Sherborne, representing Mr Depp, told the court on Monday that MsHeard had ldquotwo extra-marital affairs or ldquoextra-relationship affairs with Elon Musk and James Franco while she was going out with married to Depp.The barrister said this was relevant to the actorrsquos case ldquobecause part of the defendantsrsquo case or Ms Heardrsquos position is that it was Mr Depprsquos supposed paranoia and mistaken belief that she was having affairs that caused him to be violent.However, rejecting the application, Mr Justice Nicol said: ldquoThe central issue for the defence of truth is whether Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard.ldquoEvenshe had been unfaithful to him, that would be irrelevant on that central issue.ldquoI am not therefore persuaded that these categories of documents are necessary for the fair disposal of the litigation.A three-week trial at the Royal Courts of Justice in London ndash which was due to start in March, but was delayed because of the Covid- pandemic ndash is listed to begin next Tuesday, with Mr Depprsquos former partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder among the witnesses expected to give evidence.The court has heard Mr Depp intends to travel from his home in France to London to give evidence, while Ms Heard is believed to have already travelled to the UK from Calornia.The libel claim against NGN and Mr Wootton arises out of publication of an article in The Sun in April , under the headline: ldquoGone Potty ndash How can JK Rowling be lsquogenuinely happyrsquo casting we beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film Mr Depp has brought separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US, which the court heard are set for trial next year.The pair met on the set of  comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February .In May , Ms Heard obtained a restraining order against Mr Depp after accusing him of abuse, which he denied.The couple settled their orce out of court in , with Ms Heard donating her seven million US dollarssettlement to charity.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed with an excellent  stableford points, separated from a renewed Kevin ‘Lava’ MacLeod by virtue of the better inward half.The Kenneth MacKenzie Jubilee Trophy on Saturday was won by Martyn MacLeod with .He too managed by virtue of a stronger finish than DJ MacLeod’s .DJ had an incredible three birdies and an eagle in his opening nine holes to be out in .

She said it also came at the “worst possible time” given many victims were just about to go into isolation due to the coronavirus emergency.“The message of that was appalling,” she told MPs.Ms Peake noted that the first paragraph of the two-page Government statement focused on the need to protect veterans.“So we were waiting for Stormont House , we felt there was an agreement among the British and Irish governments and the Assembly, we were waiting for an action for that,” she said.“We had no warning and, all of a sudden, in the middle of Covid, a two-page statement came out that really was a demarcation away, with absolutely no warning, at a time when victims and survivors were most vulnerable.“The first paragraph was around the need to protect veterans and then moved on to victims and survivors.“As of last week, we have had one call with the Secretary of State , we’ve had nothing since. We have asked for meetings with the NIOofficials, we’ve had two, which we have asked for, and we were told there’s going to be extensive consultation, we haven’t seen that.“We were told that there would be papers, they haven’t come, and I understand maybe they won’t come.“So it’s really a very, very dficult position for victims and survivors to be in and I really can’t emphasise enough it really feeds mistrust, it feeds a sense that we don’t matter, and that this simply is about veterans and is not about addressing the needs of victims and survivors, and that is grossly unfair.“It’s very unfair to victims and survivors to do that.”Member of the South East Fermanagh Foundationvictims’ group also gave evidence to the committee on Wednesday.Seff has four outreach bases across Northern Ireland and also operates a service in London for the benefit of victims and survivors in Great Britain.Director of Services Kenny Donaldson said the Stormont House proposals were “unacceptable and unworkable”.Mr Donaldson insisted it should be the PSNI’s role to investigate legacy crimes, rather than bringing in officers from where in the UK.He also told MPs the Irish government needed to fully participate in the process and disclose relevant information.The campaigner said any new legacy mechanisms should be founded on the principle that there was never any justication for the use of criminal violence for political objectives.“Over the - period there should have an acknowledgement that criminal violence was wrong and wholly unjustied, that didn’t happen but a quarter of a century later it must now happen, otherwise whatever we seek to achieve on legacy will continue to be built on sand,” he said.“There is a need to re-calibrate society now”.He added: “The Republic of Ireland State sought to portray itself as an onlooker to the problems of Northern Ireland, this is not accurate and there must be a sea change within that attitude, we seek a dferent level of commitment on these issues from the new government recently elected.“There needs to be a much closer collaboration between the ious jurisdictional governments on these issues, no innocent victim or survivor should be left behind.“We believe that we have submitted alternative proposals around an investigative body being housed within the PSNI which are workable, fair, affordable and crucially can deliver outcomes for victims and survivors and we ask for this committee’s detailed consideration of those proposals and moreover, the UK Government’s”.PAMost ReadNoah Donohoe poured #letime of love# into  years, funeral toldCoronavirus Northern Ireland: O#Neill #satisfied# her actions were within regulations at Storey funeral, but says selfie #should not have happened#Man killed in Co Down after being trapped under carBobby Storey funeral a kick in teeth, says woman forced to miss mum#s burialEilis O#HanlonOpinionHow Gerry Adams tried to put some distance between Bobby Storey and real tale of his past,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Inside was a large framed photograph of Noah and his mother Fiona, showing both of them smiling, with the St Malachy#s school crest above it. A black and green ribbon - the colours of St Malachy#s - was tied to the handle of the white coffin. After Mass the cortege, which was en route to Roselawn cemetery, made a brief stop at the Antrim Road college, where Noah, described in the homily as someone who carried his potential so lightly and so humbly, was a Year  student.Pupils and teachers lined the avenue leading up the school to pay their respects.Outside, a large crowd had gathered making social distancing dficult.The gates of the school have become an impromptu shrine to its lost boy, with the iron work emblazoned with flowers, candles and messages of sympathy.Earlier, Fr McGinnity said Noah#s grieving friends and schoolmates were also in the family#s thoughts.Indeed, right now, students from Noah#s form class are attending a prayer service... together they will be remembering the joy and goodness that he brought into the lives of so many, the priest said. We remember the messages they sent to Noah#s family, and the many tributes they paid on social media and across the airwaves. Those messages and tributes have been a source of immense comfort.One of his close friends said on social media during the week, #Noah had so much potential in everything he did#.What endeared him to his friends was the fact that he carried that potential so lightly and so humbly.

Another was found to have driven through a mph zone at mph and in once case, a driver was caught speeding through a mph area at mph.Mr Sherrard said: I actually find it very distressing to think that someone - anyone - would think it is acceptable to drive at mph on any road.There is no way that driver was in control of the car at that speed so the potential to kill some innocent person or themselves is obvious. He continued: Driving through a built up area with a speed limit of mph at almost mph is, in my opinion, the absolute height of irresponsibility.And I really hope that the person detected doing that speed felt the full rigours of the law.We have members in Le After who lost loved ones through road traffic collisions perhaps  or  years ago and they are still suffering, they are still missing their loved one every day just as we continue to miss my father every day.If you take someone#s le because of your driving, you have to live with the consequences of that for ever.I don#t believe anyone who gets into a car and drives over the speed limit intentionally sets out to kill anyone butthey do they are bringing that burden on their own shoulders too. I can#t imagine it is an easy thing to live with.While many speeding offences are at the lower end of the scale, Mr Sherrard said even a few miles per hour over the recommended limit could cause devastation.He added: It beggars belief that in spite of the very graphic road safety ads we see on our television screens depicting how even a few miles an hour over the speed limit can cause catastrophic damage, so many people think there is nothing wrong with speeding.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in yearThe number of speeding offences in Northern Ireland has surged by % year-on-year.Most ReadNoah Donohoe poured #letime of love# into  years, funeral toldCoronavirus Northern Ireland: O#Neill #satisfied# her actions were within regulations at Storey funeral, but says selfie #should not have happened#Man killed in Co Down after being trapped under carBobby Storey funeral a kick in teeth, says woman forced to miss mum#s burialEilis O#HanlonOpinionHow Gerry Adams tried to put some distance between Bobby Storey and real tale of his past,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Emma De Souza became embroiled in a battle over citizenship after the UK Home Office rejected a residence card application for her US-born husband Jake to live and work in Northern Ireland. In a blog post, the Magherafelt native also expressed disappointment that there would be ‘no northern representation’ in the Seanad. “I am personally disappointed to not be nominated but that personal disappointment pales in comparison to my disappointment that there is no Northern representation,” she said. “The new Programme for Government is titled, “A shared Island”, and the document itself is ambitious with a raft of initiatives to improve North-South relations. googletag.cmd.push “That message was immediately undercut by the absence of a Northern nomination yesterday.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"From the pages  of the Down Recorder%2C July 1%2C 2000  ","story":"KILCLIEF ndash It will be the end of an era when St Malachyrsquos Primary School, Kilclief, closes on Friday for the start of the summer holidays.Many of the children will be back in two monthsrsquo time, but not their headmaster, Mr Pat Watterson, who is retiring after  years in charge of the small country school.ldquoI will be taking away plenty of terric memories of my years at St Malachyrsquos, Mr Watterson said yesterday.ldquoThis school has been blessed with a wonderful atmosphere and I have made many friends.

In this his third series, Joe s with another fascinating set of programmes celebrating the mighty achievements of the past that have transformed our daily living and reveals the cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of our infrastructure.With the help of the experts in their respective fields, Joe reveals the stories behind some of Northern Irelandrsquos well-known landmarks and also sheds light on how civil engineering is in operation quite literally beneath our feet!Get ready to go salt mining, quarry blasting, castle roofing, engine restoring, road surfacing and flood preventing to name a few of the activities that Joe gets involved with in this series.In the opening episode which airs next Monday night at pm, Joe visits Delamont which nestles on the shores of the internationally acclaimed waterway.The country park is home to the largest monolith or standing stone in the UK and Ireland, with the signicant landmark standing  metres tall and weighing in at almost  tonnes.Ancient civilisations throughout the world marked important occasions and cosmic events by erecting megaliths, often in circles or other formations, but sometimes as free-standing monoliths. There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

Photo: Victoria Jones PA WireThe protests were against police officers’ use of force, their attitudes to black people and a lack of accountability for their actions.The demonstrations took place, of course, at the same time as the country was addressing the coronavirus emergency, as the whole world still is.Despite the sense of a crisis within a crisis that developed, it was good to hear Microsoft Corporation co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates telling the BBC that, despite being “very imperfect”, the United States is still “amazing in a lot of ways” not least when it comes to medical research into vaccines and despite “current challenges”.Canon Ian M Ellis, who is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...President Trump’s appearance for a photo-opportunity outside St John’s episcopal church, not far from the White House, holding a Bible, led to much revulsion, including comments by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland’s new moderator, Dr David Bruce, that Mr Trump had “crossed the line” by using religious symbols.The president’s actions were inappropriate, provocative and most regrettable.Moreover, the US Episcopal Church’s News Service indicated that leaders of the denomination, with which the Church of Ireland is in communion, had condemned the reported use of tear gas and rubber bullets to clear clergy and protesters from the area around St John’s so that President Trump could use it as he did.Mr Trump “used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us,” Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said.The Bishop of Washington, Rt Rev Mariann Budde, told ‘The Washington Post’ she had been “outraged”, adding that everything Mr Trump “has said and done is to inflame violence. We need moral leadership, and he’s done everything to ide us”.Perhaps one of the most striking responses to the George Floyd killing and President Trump’s actions came with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, pausing speechless for over twenty seconds before answering a reporter’s related question.He then said: “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States. It is a time to pull people together but it is a time to listen. It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades.”Yet he went on to call on Canadians to accept that there is a parallel problem in their country, stating: “It is a time for us as Canadians to recognise that we too have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialised Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day.”Indeed, racism is a global scourge and a real human indignity.Claire Stam, a writer for the ‘Euractiv’ website which focuses on EU policy and politics, recently recalled the first anniversary of the murder of the former president of Germany’s Kassel district, Walter Lübcke.Mr Lübcke had been responsible for the accommodation of refugees and had been threatened because he stood for democratic values and a humane refugee policy, Claire Stam wrote, adding bluntly: “On  June , he was found dead, shot in the head.”She went on to point out that over the past year “two racist-motivated murderous attacks” followed in the German cities of Hanau and Halle and that this month Senegalese-born German MP Karamba Diabyhad been sent a tweet telling him he is “not welcome” in Germany.Closer to home, Northern Ireland does not have a good reputation either as far as race relations go.Statista, the data providing company, has analysed the number of racially motivated hate crimes in Northern Ireland during the period -, reporting a low point of less than  offences in  , but indicating that “a drastic growth of race crime was recorded in the following years”, rising to a new peak in   with , racist incidents.Belfast has been called the race-hate capital of Europe, which is nothing less than a disgraceful epithet for Northern Ireland’s capital.However, the public expressions of protest at George Floyd’s killing that have taken place in Belfast, while rendering social distancing dficult to say the least, have highlighted a dferent attitude.At the same time, Chief Constable Simon Byrne and the Public Health Agency’s head of health protection, Dr Gerry Waldron, both rightly issued important warnings.The chief constable tweeted that while he condemned the murder of George Floyd, “public protests at this time will endanger lives”, adding: “We must support #BlackLivesMatter but also stop the spread of Covid-.”Dr Waldron said: “We’ve got to bear in mind that the virus hasn’t got any conscience and ... doesn’t recognise good causes.”The death of George Floyd in such tragic and disturbing circumstances must surely cause every person, here and around the world, to think deeply about their own attitudes.• Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe -year-old actor is suing the tabloidrsquos publisher, News Group Newspapers , and its executive editor Dan Wootton over an April  article which referred to Mr Depp as a ldquowe beater.The article related to allegations made against Mr Depp by actress Ms Heard, , that he was violent towards her during their marriage ndash claims he strenuously denies. vw,vw,px, px\"Amber Heard alleges that Johnny Depp was violent towards her during their marriage In a last-ditch attempt to derail the High Court trial, due to start next Tuesday, NGNrsquos legal team had asked Mr Justice Nicol to strike out Mr Depprsquos claim.Adam Wolanski QC argued the Hollywood star was in ldquoserious breach of a court order because he had not given NGNrsquos legal team what he referred to as the ldquoAustralia drugs texts between Mr Depp and his assistant, Nathan Holmes.Mr Justice Nicol found on Monday that Mr Depp had breached an ldquounless order requiring him to disclose documents from separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US ndash which include the text messages.However, in a ruling on Thursday, the judge said he would grant Mr Depprsquos application for ldquorelief from sanctions, meaning the trial will go ahead as planned.The judge said his decision was conditional on Mr Depp giving an undertaking that he will not seek sanctions against Ms Heard for allegedly breaching a court order, made during separate libel proceedings in the US, by providing The Sunrsquos legal team with evidence. vw,vw,px, px\"Amber Heard and Johnny Depp married in Los Angeles in February  During a hearing last week, Mr Wolanski said the messages, sent in late February and early March  ndash shortly before an alleged incident in Australia between Mr Depp and Ms Heard, which she claims was ldquoa three-day ordeal of physical assaults ndash demonstrated that Mr Depp was trying to get drugs during the Australia visit.He told the court that references to ldquohappy pills and ldquowhitey stuff showed Mr Depp was trying to obtain MDMA and cocaine, which he argued was ldquoprofoundly damaging to his case.The alleged incident in Australia is one of  separate allegations of domestic violence, between early  and May , that NGN relies on in its pleaded defence to Mr Depprsquos claim.Mr Justice Nicol refused an application by Mr Depprsquos legal team for an order requiring Ms Heard to disclose evidence, including a covert audio recording made of a conversation between herself and her former husband in July .The actor had also asked for ldquoall communications between Ms Heard and a contact saved in her phone as ldquoRocketman, who Mr Depp claims is SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, and between her and actor James Franco. vw,vw,px, px\"Johnny Depprsquos former partner Winona Ryder is expected to give evidence David Sherborne, representing Mr Depp, told the court on Monday that MsHeard had ldquotwo extra-marital affairs or ldquoextra-relationship affairs with Elon Musk and James Franco while she was going out with married to Depp.The barrister said this was relevant to the actorrsquos case ldquobecause part of the defendantsrsquo case or Ms Heardrsquos position is that it was Mr Depprsquos supposed paranoia and mistaken belief that she was having affairs that caused him to be violent.However, rejecting the application, Mr Justice Nicol said: ldquoThe central issue for the defence of truth is whether Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard.ldquoEvenshe had been unfaithful to him, that would be irrelevant on that central issue.ldquoI am not therefore persuaded that these categories of documents are necessary for the fair disposal of the litigation.A three-week trial at the Royal Courts of Justice in London ndash which was due to start in March, but was delayed because of the Covid- pandemic ndash is listed to begin next Tuesday, with Mr Depprsquos former partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder among the witnesses expected to give evidence.The court has heard Mr Depp intends to travel from his home in France to London to give evidence, while Ms Heard is believed to have already travelled to the UK from Calornia.The libel claim against NGN and Mr Wootton arises out of publication of an article in The Sun in April , under the headline: ldquoGone Potty ndash How can JK Rowling be lsquogenuinely happyrsquo casting we beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film Mr Depp has brought separate libel proceedings against Ms Heard in the US, which the court heard are set for trial next year.The pair met on the set of  comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February .In May , Ms Heard obtained a restraining order against Mr Depp after accusing him of abuse, which he denied.The couple settled their orce out of court in , with Ms Heard donating her seven million US dollarssettlement to

have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\"
