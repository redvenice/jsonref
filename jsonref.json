They have tremendous loyalty to both parents and learn early on to navigate between the two camps.They hate to hear their parents slagging off each other and generally decide that total discretion is the wisest modus vivendi – rarely telling one parent anything about their time with the other.I remember freaking out when I learnt, through a third party, that my son Sam, then six years old, had slept in his father’s Majorcan bar during his stay with him. But Sam never mentioned it to me, nor seemed particularly put out when I raised the topic.Children are very accepting of each parent’s character and, as they grow up, instinctively understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.There have been countless times when, annoyed as I may have been with my ex, I have known that he would have a better take than me on one of our child’s worries. At moments like this, shared responsibility is a relief.Divorced parenting is never easy but the best thing you can do for your kids is to try to ensure they have an equally strong relationship with both parents.

Personally, I’m all for women being able to wear as little or as much as they are comfortable in and have no problem mixing a sequined thong with feminism.But where I do get confused is how the girls expect men to react to them in these overtly sexual costumes.

It’s a lot of money but I saved up because I knew I wanted this breed.One of her tricks is playing fetch like a dog. She has a little stick toy with a feather on it and if you throw it she’ll bring it back — but only if she wants to play. Everything is on her terms.I get so many comments about her, particularly about her amber eyes. Her coat is very dense, almost like velvet, and I brush it every day.She sheds but I keep it under control.I’d read this breed could be clumsy and didn’t believe it until I got one.

They can be anything from the palest grey blue to the darkest blue. But it’s their gorgeous copper eyes like autumn leaves that I find most beautiful.As house cats they prefer to be indoors although I have a cat run if they ever want to escape on a really hot day.

On Monday, Moon tweeted that one of the dogs, named Gomi, gave birth to six healthy puppies last Friday.\u0027Six dogs were added to a gift of two dogs.

They plan to jointly verify the results in December.The September deal also contained an agreement to create buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, which took effect on November 1.The Koreas and the U.S.-led U.N. Command recently finished removing firearms and troops from a jointly controlled area at the border village of Panmunjom and eventually plan to allow tourists to freely move around there.The two countries have also been clearing mines from front-line areas and plan to start in April their first-ever joint search for remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.While their militaries move ahead with tension-reducing steps, President Moon is otherwise running out of goodwill gestures toward North Korea, which is under heavy U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program. Unless the sanctions are lifted, it would be impossible for Moon to push ahead with his more ambitious plans for engagement, such as reconnecting railways and roads across the border and normalizing operations at a jointly-run factory park.After a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea this year.The north has since taken measures such as dismantling its nuclear test site and parts of its rocket-engine testing facility.Now, Pyongyang insists that sanctions should be removed before there is any further progress in negotiations. Washington, however, says they will remain until the North takes more concrete steps toward the irreversible and verifiable removal of its nuclear weapons. Analysts say the discord may have caused the last-minute cancellation of a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, that had been scheduled for this past Thursday.  The two were due to discuss denuclearization issues and had planned to set up a second summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.

South Korean marines take part in a regular drill on Yeonpyeong Island on November 1 2018North Korean media mentioned the cancelled meeting for the first time on Saturday, when the Chosun Sinbo website reported that the talks could still be productive. But it repeated North Korean warnings that the country could restart its nuclear weapons development if the U.S. does not make more concessions.The biggest combat-readiness war game ever staged in and around Japan also went ahead last week, with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan joining Japanese destroyers and a Canadian warship in the ocean off Japan - another key player in the effort to pressure North Korea.\u0027It\u0027s an anachronistic military move to openly hold war drills aimed at others while the United States naval forces residing in Japan are also participating,\u0027 Rodong Sinmun said. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/16/17/4E4F309A00000578-0-image-m-14_1531760238587.jpg","title":"Mothers holiday snap baby looks like carrying little bit extra bikini","story":"    Can you spot what is wrong with this photo?

Stylised and spectacular, it featured superstar male actors whose wild expressions were often immortalised by artists such as Utagawa Kunisada (1786-1865) and then reproduced using wooden printing blocks. Tim Clark, head of the British Museum’s Japanese section, has just acquired 359 of these prints that will go on display at the museum’s Mitsubishi Corporation Japanese galleries next year. “The prints served as a memento for fans of how a particular actor interpreted a particular role,” he says. “Each design was sold at an affordable price – proverbially, ‘for a bit more than a double helping of noodles’.” For Clark, they’re an amazing glimpse into the past. “They still transmit the energy and beauty of performances from 200 years ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a3a2a6887cbedbb7115b941c954629c59de2ed3/25_234_3263_1958/master/3263.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ca6e620b02aab445a7e9011efac8fa80 2600w","title":"deja vu sainsburys christmas ad smacks of john lewis campaign","story":"Both feature school plays and samey straplines, but Sainsbury’s is ‘not worried’When Sainsbury’s signed up the director of the Hollywood hit The Greatest Showman to make its Christmas campaign the grocer probably thought it had the festive season all wrapped up.The only problem is the campaign, which breaks on social media and during ITV’s Coronation Street on Monday, bears an uncanny resemblance to an ad recently put out by the perennial Christmas campaign winner John Lewis.The Sainsbury’s ad, by Michael Gracey who directed the $400m-plus grossing Hugh Jackman musical, features a festive school play which seems to get off to a shaky start but goes on to be a winner with the cast performing a rendition of the New Radicals’ 1990s classic You Get What You Give. Sainsbury’s denies it is worried about similarities between its ad and a joint John Lewis and Waitrose one that ran in September. It features a school play where the cast also stun the audience by knocking out a great version of a well-known classic, in this case Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody.Laura Boothby, the head of broadcast marketing at Sainsbury’s, played down any concerns that similarities with John Lewis’ campaign, which launches its much-anticipated festive ad this week, could take the sparkle out of its Christmas ambitions.Boothby said Sainsbury’s began work on its Christmas ad in January and had not been tempted to go back to the drawing board. “When John Lewis launched they set a standard,” she said. “I wasn’t worried. It is right for Sainsbury’s, it was still the right thing for us.”The John Lewis campaign, the first joint campaign with Waitrose to promote the two retailers’ rebranding as John Lewis \u0026amp Partners and Waitrose \u0026amp Partners, uses the strapline: “When you’re part of it, you put your heart into it.” Sainsbury’s Christmas campaign has opted for: “We give all we’ve got for the ones we love.”“The school show is a flagship Christmas moment for many,” said Boothby. “The evenings spent frantically learning lines, the inventive costumes, the whole family truly plays a part. This made it the perfect setting to bring our Christmas message to life.”Sainsbury’s, which spent an estimated £7m on advertising last December, has made the ad campaign the centrepiece of a wider marketing push that includes product-led ads on TV, radio, in newspapers, digital and outdoor advertising such as billboards, posters and buses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7eecb20a367c8edf456c21ee01461c07af639f8/0_90_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80999f6ef3104e044d8e99765304a65a","title":"mod babcock report boatman capital research","story":"Defence firm rejects claims from shadowy analyst group Boatman Capital Research Babcock International, which counts the Ministry of Defence as its biggest customer, has insisted its finances are healthy after what it described as “false and malicious” claims from a shadowy analyst group.The FTSE250 engineering services company has come under attack from Boatman Capital Research, which late last week published a report criticising the company’s financial performance.Claims made by Boatman, which is not traceable on Companies House, include that Babcock drastically overpaid when it struck a £1.6bn deal for Avincis, one of the world’s largest providers of helicopters for search and rescue missions, in 2014.The report prompted Babcock to issue an unscheduled statement to investors denying the claims. “Babcock is issuing this statement to address recent speculation following the release of a report by the anonymous and so far untraceable Boatman Capital,” the company said. “This report included many false and malicious statements which the group strongly refutes. At the same time, the group continues to seek to discover who is behind Boatman Capital.”The investor update also contained a statement from the UK government supporting Babcock, although it did not directly address the claim regarding delays and potential losses for Babcock on the Warrior light tank renewal programme.“We monitor the health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Babcock, and remain committed to working with them on a wide range of programmes,” said a spokesman for the UK government.“Babcock plays a key part in equipping our world leading armed forces and the MoD spent more than £1.7bn with the company last year, supporting thousands of jobs across the nation.”Babcock, which is the MoD’s second largest supplier and is working on 128 contracts for the government, said the company “continues to enjoy a healthy financial position”.Boatman, whose website says it is “guiding investors across troubled waters”, first moved against Babcock in October, claiming the company had been “burying bad news about its performance” and that its leadership team was “not up to the job”.Boatman also made claims about Babcock’s Appledore shipyard in Devon, which the company announced would shut in March after it failed to find enough work to sustain the yard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ff85e76f1cb352b2b1ba2820a89a68fe07fdae/0_0_2610_1566/master/2610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f860cf3d585418793511e435e6dcebe0","title":"tobacco shares us bat imperial brands fda menthol ban","story":"BAT and Imperial Brands slide as FDA considers menthol ban and tougher e-cigarette rulesBritish American Tobacco and Imperial Brands had £7bn wiped from their stock market value as US regulators prepare to crack down on the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes.The US Food and Drug Administration will this week impose a ban on the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes in tens of thousands of convenience stores and petrol stations across the US. The agency, which is trying to curb the huge increase in vaping among teenagers, will also impose age-verification requirements for online sales.The FDA is also proposing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which, although it could take up to two years to be finalised and enforced, would be a major blow for BAT. It sells Newport, one of the most popular menthol brands in the US, through its subsidiary Reynolds American, which it picked up following a $25bn (£19.5bn) deal to buy Lorillard in 2015.E-cigarette products in mint, menthol and tobacco flavours will still be sold in retail outlets in the US for now, because US officials did not want to create a situation where cigarettes were more attractive to smokers who prefer a mint or menthol flavour.In 2013, the FDA concluded that menthol cigarettes are harder to quit and pose a greater health risk than regular cigarettes.Last week, the Imperial Brands chief executive, Alison Cooper, told investors that the company was targeting ambitious growth plans at “next-generation products” it owns the blu e-cigarette brand.In June, San Francisco voters approved a proposition to ban the sale of flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, in a battle in which tobacco company RJ Reynolds, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, contributed $12m against the measure.Last year, BAT re-entered the US market after a 12-year absence with the $47bn acquisition of Reynolds, owner of brands including Pall Mall, Newport and Camel, in a move that created the world’s biggest tobacco company and was expected to speed up the development of e-cigarettes and vapes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd7bec6eea3c4a2d7d63a26e04a94db5f0129856/0_147_3958_2375/master/3958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9f0e3bf323bc781401fc17d8a3eaf95","title":"as american psycho showed me banning immoral books makes them more compelling","story":"My underage reading of Bret Easton Ellis’s novel seemed exciting at the time, but only because it was forbiddenOxford University’s decision to display the Bodleian library’s collection of “immoral” books has reminded me of my stint in the restricted section. At 17, I successfully borrowed Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho from my local library in New Zealand, where it was (and still is) classified R18 and kept behind the counter.The librarian did not ask to see my ID – not because I looked 18, because I definitely didn’t. I can only assume the futility of her gatekeeper role in the internet age must finally have got to her. I spent the summer holidays immersed in sadistic violence, drug use, offensive language and sex scenes, despite being seven months shy of the classification office’s assessment of when I could be expected to understand that it was satire.I do recall being disturbed by some scenes – but not, I think, to the lasting detriment of my “mental wellbeing and developing worldviews”, as prophesied by the classification office. If anything glamourised American Psycho, it was not its “elite and sophisticated setting”, but the lurid R18 sticker on its cover.No text is more compelling than one that is supposed to be off-limits. When my older sister was 11, a post-watershed broadcast of Jaws left her seeking shelter on top of the kitchen table. My colleague remembers, at 14, seeking out the 1980 horror film Cannibal Holocaust (“I thought it was a documentary”). At high school, my flatmate staged illicit lunchtime screenings as part of “Secret Video Club” – A Clockwork Orange landed him and five others in detention, but he remembers the film fondly: “It got me into Rossini.”I am inclined to say that what doesn’t damage our worldview makes us stronger (or, in the classification office’s language, “inures” us). Classification systems are inevitable and well-intentioned, but – equally inevitably – counterproductive. My lasting impression of American Psycho is that it is surprisingly insipid, for all the violence. Being handed it at 17 felt like getting served at a bar.

That is hardly news: all policies involve reservations. But to describe a customs union fall-back as vassalage, bondage and enslavement insults both language and history. May’s colleagues are at this critical moment seeking to undermine her attempt to find a way through a political nightmare, and with no proffered alternative. That is anarchy.Irrespective of whether a customs union with Europe is good for Britain – and evidence and common sense suggests it is – an interim fall-back to no customs union is utter stupidity. It would mean border chaos, massive disruption to food supplies, damage to exports and yawning gaps in labour supply. A mix of personal ambition and reckless brinkmanship may appeal to hot-blooded ministers. But that is not responsible government.Negotiating Brexit was never to be easy. The case for a political breach with the EU was emotional rather than rational, but at least it could work. The UK simply ceases to be a member of the EU next March. But two years on from the referendum, the case for an economic breach remains elusive. There are no other market openings that could possibly replicate the EU’s now complex single market. May’s own pretence that such a “unicorn” exists was always fantasy. Now her unicorn has come home to graze.Even so, she and the country are entitled to expect those selected to lead the government to keep the public interest at heart. The border with Ireland was always a clincher, because Northern Ireland exposed the reality, that Britain cannot both be part of the EU economy and not part of it. It must be Cyprus or not Cyprus. No Brexit plan has resolved this satisfactorily for the simple reason that it is not resolvable. Two further years of transition negotiations will probably not do so either. If we wish to trade friction-free with the EU, we must do so on its terms. Trade is a barter, not a shackle. The issue is balance of interest, and that must lie in a customs union.Party discipline is now disintegrating. The Tories’ favourite “secret weapon”, loyalty, has gone blunt. Sooner or later, every MP will have to stand up and be counted, “deal or no deal”. The latter would not be the end of the world, but it would plainly be disruptive and very expensive – and yield no conceivable public benefit. It is astonishing that those elected to run the country, including as paid servants of the crown, can seriously contemplate it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3136943ead06235f6d327431f0a87741542334/0_51_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf83caf4fedb49b2a7d435d69c85c544","title":"theresa may tory right brexit dup hard brexiters","story":"There is no wriggle room left with the DUP and hard Brexiters over a potential dealOver the years, different Conservative leaders have tended to use similar tactics to deal with the rightwing anti-EU minority in the party. Ever since Tory leaders stopped winning decent majorities in 1992, they have tried to bribe the right, but the price has grown with each concession. Major gave them social conservatism. Hague ran a “keep the pound” campaign. Cameron gave them the Brexit referendum. Theresa May will run out of money this week, and she now faces a reckoning.The choreography was supposed to be this: strike a deal with the EU on the Irish border on Monday, get cabinet agreement on Tuesday, hold a summit with EU leaders on 17-18 November, and hold the parliamentary vote in December. But it is far from clear that a deal will survive contact with the cabinet, the DUP and the European Research Group.The first problem is that the EU will not allow the UK to end the “backstop’’ unilaterally. The 27 have accepted May’s demand for an all-UK customs union to complement a special status for Northern Ireland, if the Irish border cannot be kept open by other means. She had hoped that this would split the DUP from the ERG, because it prevents a customs border in the Irish Sea (although there would be a regulatory border). But the EU will not allow the backstop to be time-limited or the UK to leave the backstop unilaterally, because it would not then be a failsafe method to stop any border checks on the island of Ireland. Tory Brexiters – with some reason – fear that the EU will not agree that any new technologies or tariff cashback schemes will be enough to end the backstop, once it has been triggered, and Britain will be, to their mind, stuck in “vassalage”.The second problem is that the DUP is refusing to be mollified by an all-UK backstop. Again, it has a reasonable case, if you accept its uncompromising unionist logic. The mooted all-UK backstop is clearly two backstops: a customs union for the UK as a whole, and single market participation in agriculture and industrial goods for Northern Ireland. That isn’t enough to prevent checks between Britain and Northern Ireland (the EU checks imports to the single market for compliance with agriculture and goods standards, and VAT). The DUP has made it plain that it will not accept either a regulatory or customs border down the Irish Sea.The third problem is that there is no convincing plan to prevent the backstops from happening. The text of the deal will include a negotiating sequence. The UK and EU will try to keep the Irish border open with a trade deal encompassing the whole of the UK. The transition might be extended to give the parties more time to reach an agreement. Britain and Northern Ireland will fall into their respective backstops only if no agreement is reached. But the chances of such a trade deal being reached are very slim.May has already suggested two ways to avoid a backstop, both of which have been rejected by the EU. Her first proposal was to use technology and a dual-tariff system to prevent customs checks. The EU said that a dual-tariff scheme encouraged fraud and that the technology does not exist. Her second was for all-UK participation in the single market for goods and agriculture. The EU rejected that, saying that this violated their principle that all freedoms of the single market must come as a package. It is unlikely that the EU will be more compromising once the UK has left, and any technological fixes will be a long time coming, if they ever turn up at all. Brexiters are right that the UK is heading towards a long-term customs union with the EU, extinguishing their hopes for trade deals and deregulation. The UK will have to continue with EU employment, environment, state aid, fish and agriculture rules to participate in a customs union.If May survives this week without more ministers resigning and a leadership challenge, she faces a parliamentary vote that will be difficult to win. The political declaration on the future relationship will be vague, but the withdrawal agreement leads the UK towards a customs union, which reduces her votes to the right. She will probably have to rely on Labour votes to win, and polling suggests leave voters in Labour constituencies are changing their minds. She has sought compromise since her ill-fated general election, but the UK’s politicians appear to be too polarised for turning.• John Springford is deputy director of the Centre for European Reform in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239f55e1689837a4789c779ed3c37ac1c44e5d50/380_155_4852_2911/master/4852.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1479297899e1e19ac4291b49753aca95","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of snug","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘snug’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘snug’ (please note that these are no longer published online).

Do you make something you’d like to make more of? Here’s how to turn what you love into what you doIt’s the old cliche: if you do what you love, you never work a day. But for the people who’ve turned a hobby into their livelihood, it’s not an aphorism – it’s a way of life.It definitely still sounds like a cliche. Who are these blessed people?There are, believe it or not, masses of them. Look at the handmade, the homemade or the made-to-measure and you’re seeing the work of people who have turned a beloved pastime into a profitable business. Trust us, now you know, you’ll start seeing them everywhere.An artisanal epidemic? ChillingAnd they’re multiplying: a 2017 poll of more than 4,000 people for  Money by Start Up Loans and YouGov showed that almost a third of those surveyed have considered turning their hobby into a business. ‘Considered’ to committed is quite a leap. Who’s actually made it?Meet Catherine Ross – solicitor turned full-time candlemaker and founder of the award-winning nancy\u0026ampnell – and Sanjay Aggarwal – recruitment agent turned co-founder of Spice Kitchen, makers of (also award-winning) artisanal spices and teas.Ross’s business came out of her hunt for a lifestyle change. Leaving her job as a solicitor, she spent her days making candles as presents for friends as she tried out various new careers. None of them stuck, but her candles got better and better – and the friends who received them became more and more enthusiastic. Eventually, one friend nudged her towards a eureka moment: “These are lovely,” she said, “Why don’t you sell them? Why don’t you try?” Growing her hobby from here, via a local shop, to her own successful online store, Ross hasn’t looked back: “The delight for me has been that I don’t get that Sunday night feeling any more,” she says. Meanwhile, Aggarwal was looking for a way to help his recently retired mother overcome boredom. She’d been cooking all her life, drawing on her Indian upbringing to create authentic, hand-blended spices at home – something that Aggarwal noticed was in short supply in the UK. He also saw that nobody was selling the beautiful, traditional Indian spice boxes she used. “I thought it might be a nice idea if my mum was able to sell a tin but with her homemade blends inside – it would be a perfect starter kit,” he says. He posted one on ebay. “We sold that one and then another one and another and I guess the rest is history,” he says.But how did they know it would work?They didn’t, not at first. Aggarwal and his mother started slowly, one spice box at a time. Ross, too, took a small batch of candles to her village store as a test case, to see how they’d sell over the festive season. “If you can’t sell at Christmas then you’ll never sell,” she said at the time. When these did well, she invested her time in creating a brand identity and a website – building what would become a loyal online following.Equally, Aggarwal only quit his full-time job in recruitment when he took the spice boxes to his first trade show. “The response was very good, and I thought: ‘You know what, this has got legs,’” he says. Spice Kitchen now has 200 stockists and has sold tens of thousands of spice kits.OK, I’m interested. And kind of crafty. How do I start?Slowly. Both Ross and Aggarwal started by testing the waters with a small sample group and minimum expense they moved forward after positive feedback and, ultimately, sales. You’ve got nothing to lose (and everything to gain) by easing into it.Dave Stallon, commercial director of the Federation of Small Businesses, adds that it’s all about planning and preparation. He recommends you start by looking at the market, getting a sense of the competition (or, if you’re lucky like Aggarwal, any glaring gaps in your field) and current trends – then you can start making financial projections and thinking about potential spikes and dips your business might see.The planning should start at home. “Think about the best space to work in, where you won’t be distracted and can fully focus,” says Stallon. “Having the right equipment is also vital.” If you’re upscaling from a hobby, this may be your biggest initial expense – make sure you’ve planned for it.And once I’ve made some stuff? What do I do with it?Learn the art of marketing. At the same time as Aggarwal was building his business on ebay, he was establishing a loyal following on social media. For both platforms, he got professional photographs taken, which helped associate the brand with quality. He uses social media to full effect to promote his products – notably Instagram’s option to pin a link to pictures, driving to an online store.“Social media is a very, very important part of our business, we make tangible sales from that,” he says. “What’s also key is having a professional listing design and a professional store design on your ebay profile.” Ross, too, put time and money into the nancy\u0026ampnell website – making sure it was as appealing and easy to use as possible. Without this, she says, her customer base wouldn’t have grown the way it did.Fancy photos. Got it. I think I’m ready to join the home-making mob, any last pieces of advice? “You can’t do everything,” says Aggarwal, who emphasises the importance of hiring some help as soon as you can. As a business scales up, he advises, reinvest what you earn back into it, whether that’s taking on extra help or enlisting professional services such as branding.Finally, accept that mistakes and expenses are part and parcel of building a successful business. “You start testing things and you think: ‘I can’t believe I’ve spent that much money,’” says Ross. “You realise: ‘I’ve really got to pare that down, or do that differently,’ so to me there’s no wrong in that – it’s just part of the process.”Ultimately, she says, “I enjoy doing it and that makes a big difference. If that’s the most stress I’ll ever face, I’ll take it.”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a new career.

In 1990, he became a federal congressman for the same party. He has since been affiliated with a number of political parties. On 22 July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Social Liberal party.Bolsonaro espouses populist and nationalist views that often stray into far-right territory.\u0026nbsp A vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, abortion, immigration and other progressive causes, he has defended the death penalty and the 1964-85 military dictatorship. On foreign policy, he has said he wants to improve relations with the US. Economically he says he is pro free market and privatisation.\u0026nbspDeliberately provocative and polarising. He has praised Gen Pinochet, expressed support for torturers and called for political opponents to be shot, earning him\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplabel\u0026nbspof the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world”.\u0026nbsp In his bid to capitalise on Latin America’s lurch to the right, he paints himself as a tropical Donald Trump: a pro-gun, anti-establishment crusader set on draining the swamp and cracking down on violent crime.On top of repeated calls for a return to dictatorship, he has made equally inflammatory attacks on\u0026nbspwomen,\u0026nbspblack people,\u0026nbspgay people, foreigners and indigenous communities. Earlier this year,\u0026nbsphe was charged by the attorney general with inciting hate speech.\u0026nbspHis election campaign was backed by powerful agribusiness interests in Brazil but some industry leaders on Sunday called on him to show restraint.Géraldine Kutas, the head of international affairs at the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association, said the Amazon’s importance to the world – and Brazil – had to be respected.“We are perfectly fine with our current environmental regulations,” she said. “We are really committed to them and we will not support any change that would relax the rules.”Strong EU laws could reduce the ecological footprint of commodities such as soy, palm oil and beef, which drive deforestation in the Amazon, according to Greenpeace.Sébastien Risso, the group’s EU forestry director, said: “Ignoring the problem and delaying action will only move us deeper into catastrophic climate change and a major global species extinction.”EU officials noted that Bolsonaro, who takes office in January, has backtracked on some campaign pledges and said it was too soon to consider tougher due diligence checks for deforestation, despite the president-elect’s statements and initiatives aimed at relaxing environmental regulation in the Amazon.“We had them on our radar during the campaign speeches,” one EU source said. “We will assess whatever decisions are taken, once they’re taken.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408103d7f08b13004878c09788c37924a7cba4a4/0_370_4152_2492/master/4152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cbf4eff7098fc49037be596f29953cd","title":"filmstruck closure dark days for online access to classic movies","story":"Beloved of US cinephiles since 2016, and available in the UK since February, the high-end streaming site has announced its imminent closureIt’s with a measure of guilt that I write this week’s column, nine months after I reported on an exciting film streaming site that had been newly launched in the UK. “Is the future Filmstruck?” the headline asked.Sorry, we jinxed it. The US-imported service, which specialises in classic and arthouse cinema, and has become particularly beloved by film buffs for its digital housing of high-end Blu-ray label the Criterion Collection, will cease operations globally on 29 November, the plug having been pulled by the bean counters at Warner Bros Digital Networks and Turner Broadcasting. If you’re one of the (evidently too few) people who took out a subscription, you have just under three weeks to gorge on a menu that runs the gamut from The Big Sleep to Force Majeure. The UK site was only getting started, with just over 200 titles in its library the loss to film lovers Stateside, where the number had swollen to nearly 2,000, is especially sore.The reason for the shutdown was delivered in chilly corporate-speak: Filmstruck was “largely a niche service”, its operators said, from whose demise they would “take key learnings… to help shape future business decisions in the direct-to-consumer space.” The real message beneath that waffle is colder still: “Who watches old movies any more? Sorry, folks, it’s just not worth it.”The online cinephile community has rallied together in an attempt to prove them wrong. An online petition, Keep Filmstruck Alive, had gained more than 40,000 signatures at the time of writing, promoted by such film-makers as Barry Jenkins, Guillermo del Toro and Rian Johnson. “We will find a way to bring it back,” Del Toro tweeted, though if he does, it likely won’t be with the help of Warner Media, which announced plans last month for a Netflix-rivalling streaming service – to which Filmstruck was presumably regarded as a piddly distraction.These are dark days for online access to classic or specialist cinema. The world of streaming, which once seemed to open limitless possibilities for archiving and access, appears instead to be narrowing, hampered by complex licensing restrictions and cynical commercial concerns. As Netflix pours ever more resources into its booming factory of original content, its pool of existing films – the service’s raison d’etre when it was a humble DVD rental service – is dwindling. (The first films that came up when I clicked on its “classics” header were Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Breakfast Club and the Barbra Streisand version of A Star Is Born.)Cinephiles who once hoped that digital technology would usher in an era of decluttered shelves are left to their libraries of physical media. (A good portion of my own DVD collection would be awol on the internet.) Even that security blanket is frayed, however. As something of a cosmically cruel joke, in the same week that the Filmstruck bombshell landed, John Lewis announced it will no longer be selling DVD players.Lucky (Eureka, 15) As a genial bit of small-town Americana, John Carroll Lynch’s geriatric character study is pleasing but familiar.

Manchester City fundamentally are just better than United.Much of the pre-match talk had surrounded whether José Mourinho would send his side out to attack, given how his own side look better chasing games and the lingering suspicion that City, impressive as their defensive record appears, can be got at if teams could get through their press. Which is fine but, as Mike Tyson said, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.This was perhaps intended to be the equivalent of the “trivote” Mourinho liked to field at Real Madrid, a defensive block designed to sit in front of the back four, a mighty breakwater to disrupt the waves of the City attack. But it didn’t. Or at least not consistently. City went round it with Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling, and through it thanks to the silver triangle at the front of the team – Bernardo, David Silva and Sergio Agüero’s new hair.Those opening 12 minutes were stunning, as complete a demonstration of superiority as is possible at this level. But what was strange was that, after the goal, City’s level dropped. Pep Guardiola blamed his side’s attitude, pointing to a failure to press and a lack of purpose in possession, almost as though they were slightly awed by their own superiority in the early stages, surprised perhaps by how straightforward it was – leading to a loss of focus and a tendency to overcomplicate.Whatever the reason, United did, briefly, begin to disrupt them. There was an attempt to press, the front three of Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard closing down Ederson and the two full-backs when the goalkeeper had the ball. But pressing does not come naturally to this United side. In truth, so ill-constructed is the squad that nothing does, the tension between the instincts of the manager and the capacities of his squad all too evident.Because the midfield did not close up with the forward line, because United were not compact, because there was space behind that initial line of the press, it was relatively simple for Ederson, a very good long passer, to loft the ball to City midfielders. That same lack of compactness was in part responsible for City’s second goal. When Lingard miscontrolled De Gea’s clearance and was dispossessed, Agüero found himself in the sort of space he had been denied for most of the first half. His response was brutally clinical, a one-two with Mahrez that left Victor Lindelöf looking sluggish before an emphatic finish.But the real evidence of City’s dominance, of the extraordinary harmony of managerial vision and the players available (however they may have been acquired) came in the final stages. The needless penalty had let United back into the game, and raised memories of how City had squandered a 2-0 lead in the derby last season to lose 3-2. But City, after a couple of jittery moments, refused to be haunted. Their response was to end the game as they had begun it, with a triumphant expression of their philosophy.The decisive goal was no rapid counter, hitting the space behind an overcommitted United. It followed a glorious 44-pass move, a rhapsody of guardiolisme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee22492bee00cb29ee8b53ec46348311b54ad5d5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5259eb71978bdf6e83431a915ff2258","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekend action","story":"Hugo Lloris ends his madcap day on a high, Everton work out how to stop Chelsea and Salomón Rondón proves his worthUnai Emery delivered an overdue update on Danny Welbeck, the Arsenal striker who was stricken against Sporting in the Europa League last Thursday. Welbeck, the manager reported, underwent surgery last Friday to repair his badly broken ankle and he will be out for some time. With Welbeck’s contract due to expire at the end of the season, has he played his final game for the club? Emery had more pressing matters with his strikers against Wolves and he made a tactical change at half‑time, switching from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-1-2 in order to allow Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to come in from the flank and partner Alexandre Lacazette up front. In the first half, Aubameyang had routinely drifted inside from the left. He did not look comfortable in that role. Arsenal would improve to draw 1-1. Is it the best use of Aubameyang’s talents to play him off the wing? David HytnerCardiff have made a miserable start to the season, and are second favourites to go down. Yet, after Brighton lost against them, Chris Hughton decided that what he really needed to do was criticise the officials. The reality is, the laws of football are badly drafted and interpreting them requires officials to perform tasks beyond the capability of the human eye. Big mistakes are inevitable. So though Sol Bamba was, as Hughton says, offside before scoring the winning goal, that is not the point. What is the point is that Brighton took an early lead, missed fine chances to extend it and then, after Cardiff equalised, Dale Stephens got himself sent off. Which is to say that Brighton lost not because the officials made mistakes but because Brighton made mistakes. Hughton and his players would do well to acknowledge that. Daniel HarrisMarco Silva was asked about Everton’s shackling of Eden Hazard in the wake of Chelsea’s first scoreless display at Stamford Bridge under Maurizio Sarri. While he acknowledged the Belgian as the Premier League’s player of the season to date, he pointed to another tactic which had paid off handsomely to blunt the home side’s intent: Gylfi Sigurdsson and Richarlison had been charged with closing down Jorginho and unsettling “one of the keys in Maurizio’s system”. The Italy midfielder was hassled out of possession too often and unable to dictate the pace of Chelsea’s approach before being hauled off just after the hour. “He controls the match with the ball for Chelsea, but we blocked him fantastically,” the Everton manager said, offering others an insight into how to frustrate this team’s ambition. Dominic FifieldWhat had happened to Hugo Lloris? An hour into this match the Spurs goalkeeper became a clear target for the Crystal Palace artillery after the Frenchman had punched one cross on to the head of Palace’s James Tomkins, only for the ball to skid wide, and flapped at others. The next corner was worse, Lloris staying rooted to his line and giving Tomkins a free header that he put wide. It’s been a strange season on the pitch for Lloris and a problematic one off it. But Mauricio Pochettino has stuck with his man and in the last minute Lloris showed why, blocking Alexander Sørloth’s close-range shot with a superbly agile save to preserve a win for Spurs. “The players are not machines and can have ups and downs,” said Pochettino, “but I am super supportive with the players. Hugo is one of the best there is, no doubt.” Paul MacInnesAfter the start Huddersfield have made to the season they need to be looking out for winnable matches – this was an opportunity passed up. David Wagner was right to say his side were unlucky, and he could as usual take pride in the work rate and team spirit, but the Terriers cannot afford to be as wasteful in front of goal. Alex Pritchard became the first Huddersfield player to score at home this season, which is a start, though scarcely a favourable augury a dozen games in. Opportunities are being created but the strikers Steve Mounié and Laurent Depoitre have a wretched conversion rate. A patched-up West Ham were below their best, by Manuel Pellegrini’s own admission, but unlike their opponents they are looking up the table rather than over their shoulder and can look forward to Mark Noble, Jack Wilshere and Andy Carroll coming back into the side after the international break. Paul WilsonAnybody who has spent time around Leicester over the past couple of weeks will know the club have handled the most awful story in such a dignified fashion. The utmost respect has been shown to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, their former owner, and the four others who lost their lives in the helicopter accident last month but the club have also treated those who came to pay tributes, or even report on the tragedy, with a human touch. Those working on the inside have been grieving while carrying on with their day job, putting all their energy into ensuring the leadup to this emotional game, as well as the day itself, struck just the right tone. Their efforts have not gone unnoticed and prompted Susan Whelan, the chief executive, to take the unprecedented step of giving every member of staff the day off on Monday. It could not be more deserved. Stuart JamesSlavisa Jokanovic did not hold back in his criticism of the match officials at Anfield, though knew he should. “I could say they didn’t make any mistakes and had a great game,” he said. Instead, Fulham’s manager accused Paul Tierney and his assistants of disrespecting him, his club and the supporters. Even if anger was justified over Mohamed Salah’s opening goal – and replays did not end the debate over the validity of Aleksandar Mitrovic’s header 14 seconds earlier – it was a harsh verdict on the officials. Maybe it showed the manager cared not a jot about potential punishment from the Football Association with his team bottom of the Premier League and rumours about his future at Craven Cottage. His team’s display against Liverpool supported his case to be given time to adapt a new-look team to the top flight, although the international break brings a test of the Fulham ownership’s faith. Andy HunterKevin De Bruyne’s recurrent injury problems would have harmed a team of lesser resources than Manchester City but they could afford to pay €50m for Bernardo Silva, who has become hugely prominent this season. The player known as “little Messi” at Benfica has become an adaptable worker bee of the type Pep Guardiola enjoys working with. He is no luxury player: talent, skill and imagination are combined with hard labour. Silva has also taken to the “tactical fouls” on advancing opponents in midfield that Guardiola detractors point to as a cynical part of the masterplan. It was David Silva who opened City’s scoring but that would not have been possible without the younger Silva’s determination to thread the ball back from the byline. And he often skated through and around the human towers José Mourinho employed in midfield. John BrewinTwo successive wins and St James’ Park seems a different place. It appears Salomón Rondón’s goals did not merely undo Bournemouth’s backline but pacified the early-season protests against Mike Ashley. Indeed as Newcastle’s owner clapped enthusiastically from the directors’ box there was not even a hint of dissent. “It’s like this in history,” a relieved Rafael Benítez said. “The Romans had bread and circus and everybody’s happy. Now it’s football, now it’s goals and wins.” If Newcastle’s manager proved precisely why he was so keen to take Rondón on loan from West Brom, Federico Fernández’s defensive excellence emphasised the £6m invested in transporting the Argentinian from Swansea was money extremely well spent. Although it would be foolish to assume Newcastle’s struggles are over – “any win is massive for us,” said Benítez – the presence of Rondón and Fernández in their spine has put the security of mid-table within touching distance. Louise TaylorCharlie Austin is likely to discover on Monday if he faces an FA charge for labelling Simon Hooper’s decision to incorrectly rule out his goal in Southampton’s 1-1 draw with Watford a “joke”. Austin’s reaction was startling but also justified on what was a dreadful afternoon for Hooper – earlier in the game he failed to award Watford a definite penalty. Going back to his first game as a Premier League referee, Crystal Palace’s 3-1 victory at Norwich in August 2015, he also made a howler in ruling out a Cameron Jerome goal for a high boot. Yet given Hooper’s lack of experience – the match on Saturday was only his fourth in the Premier League – he perhaps deserves less criticism and more sympathy. More broadly, he surely deserves help in the form of VAR, something Austin also called for during his tirade.

According to Hayley Johnson, a senior associate in employment law for Slater and Gordon: “If someone was dismissed for not wearing a bra at work, that could be discriminatory under current law,” she says.Some very conscientious Netmums users replied to the original post saying they were worried about the lasting effect on dress code policies if women could go braless willy-nilly. One suggested that people would go to work in the nude. But Johnson says any case would be treated with common sense: “If a woman came in wearing no bra and a see-through blouse, that could be a problem,” she says.While nipples shouldn’t be nefarious, employers can be. After Nicola Thorp, a receptionist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, lost a landmark case against the company – which sent her home for not wearing heels – the government issued guidance about dress codes. But Johnson argues that it’s not worth the paper it’s written on: “They said you should avoid distinguishing between what men and women can wear, rather than that you shouldn’t do it.”Still, Johnson says she could take on the Netmums user’s case and win if the woman’s employee did make her wear a bra. “The basic rule is that if you’re requiring women to dress in a way that’s more onerous than if she were a man, it’s discrimination,” she says.“If a man turned up without underwear and let you know he wasn’t wearing it, would he be sent home? I don’t think he would.”Johnson points out that the TV presenter Richard Madeley has joked about not wearing pants to work: “It would be incredibly rare for a man to be sent home or disciplined for that. As a society, we need to wrap our heads around the fact that we shouldn’t place more onerous dress requirements on women, but that we still do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33f44941b6950583dcd6b7bf33559a6492251f4a/0_200_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcc3e37d346dd23e742a67fd00801ba","title":"taking on the eu podcast","story":"The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis staked his political career on getting a deal with the European Union – and lost.

He told Sky News: “Brexit can be stopped – but the real question is what are the decisions we are going to face over the next few weeks and months.”In the run-up to another crucial week for Theresa May on the Brexit process, the Labour clarification on a second referendum followed the decision of the rail minister, Jo Johnson, to quit the government on Friday, and also back this option.On Monday, Justine Greening, the former education secretary, condemned a “failure of leadership” by the Conservatives and Labour on Brexit, predicting that the prime minister’s plan had no chance of being passed by parliament.It remains unclear whether May will put the details of a final Brexit strategy to her cabinet on Tuesday, or wait another week to seek more unity. Citing unnamed ministerial sources, the BBC reported that several cabinet minister had serious doubts about her proposal since it was outlined in July.Starmer said given the scale of the crisis, and the likelihood of delays scuppering the chances of another emergency EU summit, all options should be kept open. He dismissed the idea of Labour helping May get a deal through parliament.“The national interest is getting the right deal,” he said. “One has to ask the question: is the prime minister genuinely negotiating in the national interest, or is she negotiating what she thinks she can get past her cabinet? And I think everybody knows the answer to that question.”In his interview with Der Spiegel, published on Friday, Corbyn had reiterated his criticisms of some EU policies. Asked if he backed the idea of a second referendum, he replied: “Not really, no. The referendum took place.”On Sunday, Corbyn was contradicted by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. Starmer told Sky a possible second referendum was the agreed party policy. “This was a big issue at our party conference in September, and we had a very strong policy position that was endorsed by everybody – myself, Jeremy, Emily – the whole of the membership,” he said.He described the possible sequence of events: “We’ll look at the deal and vote it down if it doesn’t meet our tests. If that happens, we will call for a general election. If that doesn’t happen, then all options must remain on the table. That includes the option of a public vote.”Asked about the issue later on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Starmer said: “Neither Jeremy nor anybody else has altered that position, and that is the position of the Labour party. I’m not going to pretend there aren’t different views in the Labour party. That wouldn’t be real. But that’s why we worked so hard to say what is the common ground, what is it that we, as the Labour party, can all agree on for the way forward.”Starmer said even if MPs were presented with an official option of accepting May’s plan or leaving without a deal, parliament would have some leeway: “If there was a motion that 400-plus MPs supported, saying we do not countenance no deal, and a minority countenanced no deal, the PM would then have to go forward in the teeth of parliament.”In her own party, the prime minister faces intense pressure on both sides of the Brexit ide to change course. The BBC quoted two ministers saying anonymously they did not believe May could win parliament’s backing, with one saying it was “self-harming” for her to endlessly pursue the same plan.On Friday, Johnson said May’s course offered the the UK the choice of “vassalage or chaos”, and said he would instead back a second referendum.In his latest column for the Daily , reported on the front page, Johnson’s brother, Boris, the former foreign secretary, reiterated his own criticisms of May’s plan, saying the government “seems to be on the verge of total surrender”.Speaking to BBC1’s Breakfast programme, Greening said she did not believe MPs would back May’s proposals, which she called “the worst of all worlds”.“No, I don’t think so. I think that was clear back in the summer, that parliament is gridlocked,” she said. “The reality is this deal isn’t about taking back control – you’re actually giving back control, it turns out, and we’ll have a massive loss of sovereignty, less say on the rules that we’ll have to follow, and that’s why people should have the chance to have their say on it.“It’s likely that, alongside rejecting the prime minister’s deal, parliament will also vote against a no deal. Whether or not that’s a binding vote, I think it will be almost impossible for government to simply ignore. It’s then incumbent on parliament to find a route through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01059564544e39fc958a849bc90f081a717b4dac/0_79_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e6561a5e7a0a3a391f0eecf6fcdbbe7","title":"brexit may cabinet labour starmer contradicts corbyn and says brexit can be stopped politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire a few minutes ago that he thought Theresa May was bluffing when she said the UK would leave the EU with no deal if MPs voted against her plan. Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, said he knew how important it was to UK security being involved in agencies like Eurojust. May, a former home secretary, knows this too, he argued. If the UK left with no deal, this cooperation would cease. He told the programme:I don’t think, in my heart of hearts, that this prime minister would attempt to take us out without a deal. She has done a lot of work on things like counter terrorism and security information. I don’t think she would put that in jeopardy ... I think this talk of ‘We’ll leave in March without a deal’, I think it’s a bluff. Starmer argued that, if MPs voted against May’s deal, the government would in practice have to come up with an alternative to a no deal Brexit.I’m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am.And here is the story from my colleagues Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin on the EU general affairs council.As she arrived for the EU’s general affairs council meeting this morning Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister, said whether or not there would be a Brexit deal was up to the British. She told reporters:The ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decision ...I have no crystal ball unfortunately. We are determined, we are committed to find a good deal. We know that it is better than a no-deal.She also said the EU would not agree to a backstop plan allowing the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union if the UK could withdraw unilaterally. She said:If you have any sort of temporary arrangement, this needs to be a bilateral decision from the EU27 and the UK at the same time, and we have to know at that moment what sort of solution there is for the Irish border.Michael Roth, the German Europe minister, told reporters as he arrived that the EU would need assurances that the UK would not undercut it on standards if it stayed in the customs union. He said:A customs union is an option but we must be careful that it doesn’t lead to unfair relations between the EU27 and the UK, particularly in environmental, workplace and social standards. It must be a genuine backstop.Roth also said he remained an “optimist” on the question of whether a deal would be reached, but said that “time is more than ripe for a sensible outcome”. And Didier Reynders, the Belgan foreign ministers, told reporters on his way in that he hoped a deal would be possible before Christmas.Asked if a special Brexit summit would be held in November, he said:We are ready to do that but to organise a summit you need to have some progress. If we are in the same situation as 10 days ago it is a nonsense to organise it this month. It will be maybe the case in December. We have seen some movement but it seems to be not enough.Justine Greening, the Conservative pro-European former education secretary, has just told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire that she is certain that there are more government ministers thinking of following Jo Johnson and resigning from the government because they cannot support Theresa May’s Brexit plan. But she would not be drawn on how many ministers there were in this category, saying she could not know for sure.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told EU foreign ministers at the general affairs council meeting this morning that there is still no Brexit deal yet.Here is the statement from the EU.The commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, informed the EU27 ministers of the situation following negotiations with the UK over the last few weeks. Michel Barnier explained that intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet. Some key issues remain under discussion, in particular a solution to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.During the meeting, ministers however also recalled the need to continue the work at all levels on preparations for every possible scenario.Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s story on Sir Keir Starmer contradicting Jeremy Corbyn and saying Brexit can be stopped.And here is some reaction.Pro-European Labour MPs have welcomed Starmer’s comment.But Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, claims Labour’s policy is now unclear.And Patrick O’Flynn, the Ukip MEP, says what Corbyn said was more consistent with Labour’s 2017 manifesto than what Starmer.Turning away from Brexit for a moment, in her Today interview Justine Greening, the Conservative former education secretary, said she was strongly opposed to a reported government plan to cut tuition fees to £6,500. She said:I think it’s a terrible plan. I think it’s bad for social mobility if you have a cap on numbers of students. We know that the ones that lose out are the ones from lower income families. I think it’s regressive the people who will end up paying less in student fees will be those from the better off families who are more likely to go to university.The Times (paywall) first reported more than a week ago that a government review of higher education funding is likely to recommend cutting tuition fees to between £6,500 and £7,500 a year. In England students currently pay £9,250 a year. Ahead of the Greening interview, Today also said the BBC has confirmed that the Time story was correct.On his LBC phone-in Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group, which represents around 50-odd Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, has just said that Boris Johnson’s call for the cabinet to reject Theresa May’s Chequers plan (see 9.14am) is “absolutely spot on”. But Rees-Mogg said he did not accept that this would amount to a mutiny it would just be proper cabinet government, he said, with the cabinet asserting its authority.Here are some of the other Brexit developments around this morning.Under the shameful proposals now before cabinet it will be up to some joint UKEU committee, or some “independent arbitration mechanism” to decide whether the UK – an ancient and sovereign nation – is finally allowed to come out, to run its own trade policy and set its own tariffs. And most incredibly of all, the whole process will be justiciable by the European court of justice – yes, that court that we were all told would cease to have any say in this country. I want you to savour the full horror of this capitulation. Under article 50, the UK is at least able in theory to leave the EU. We do not have to consult any other authority. But under these proposals we are agreeing that the EU would have a say on whether this country is capable of making that final exit from the EU’s essential institution, the customs union. In other words, we are on the verge of signing up for something even worse than the current constitutional position. These are the terms that might be enforced on a colony. On this point Johnson’s arguments are very similar to those cited by his pro-European brother, Jo, in the article he wrote on Friday announcing his resignation from the government because of his opposition to May’s Chequers plan.It’s the worst of all worlds. It leaves us with less influence, loss controls over the rules we have to follow and I have to say, if we were to accept it as a parliament, less credibility as a country in the rest of the world, because they would see that we would be prepared to go for a bad deal.In his  article today Boris Johnson also describes the current plan as “the worst of both worlds”.I think if the prime minister’s Brexit plan doesn’t get through parliament I think it’s quite difficult to see how the prime minister can continue because she has staked her credibility. It’s very hard for her to turn round and say ‘OK, well my plan’s been torn up by Parliament, I’ll go away and think of another one.’One cabinet minister said the group endorsed the proposal “with a very heavy heart”.Trade secretary Liam Fox expressed strong doubts about elements of the plan for trading arrangements as they could harm the ability of the UK to do trade deals after Brexit.Home secretary Sajid Javid, who backed remain, is understood to have had some similar views, describing the proposal for a common rule book with the EU for parts of the economy as “very worrying” and suggesting that there should be a review of the arrangements after five years.The leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans, is understood to have agreed, telling her colleagues that she found it difficult to accept some aspects of the proposals, and might struggle to explain them in parliament.Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey - Brexiteers who have both been reluctant to give public support for the plan - are said to have expressed significant unhappiness and questioned whether Brexiteer MPs would be able to support such a deal in parliament.Good morning. And welcome back to Brexit Groundhog Day. Yet again we start Monday with reports that Theresa May is facing a crunch week where key decisions about the Brexit withdrawal agreement will have to be made. Yet again we face the possibility that it might all prove impossible. The film analogy holds true up to a point, but it might not be a reliable guide to the future. Groundhog Day had a happy ending.There is a lot of Brexit around this morning but the key slot on the Today programme went to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. He was also on Sky.At the end of last week Jeremy Corbyn alarmed Labour’s pro-Europeans by telling the German paper Der Spiegel that Brexit could not be stopped. Here is an extract from the interview, written up in English.DER SPIEGEL: Not just Labour, but the whole country is extremely ided at the moment -- not least because of Brexit. If you could stop Brexit, would you?Corbyn: We can’t stop it. The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognize the reasons why people voted Leave.Brexit can be stopped. But the real question is what are the decisions we are going to face over the next few weeks and months? Decision one is on the deal. Decision two is if the deal goes down should there be a general election and decision three is if there is no general election all options must be on the table including the option of a public vote. That is the clear position. Jeremy is signed up to it. I’m signed up to that.I will post more from his interviews shortly.Here is the agenda for the day:9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, hosts his LBC phone-in.12.15pm: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on Brexit at the Institute for Government.2pm: Four pro-remain parties from Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, the SDLP, the Alliance party and the Greens, hold a briefing in Westminster.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Yet while he did win the Brazilian Grand Prix this was an almost unexpected victory that had turned on a moment. Max Verstappen had put in a superb drive only to be denied the top step after a clash left his chances spiralling away as Hamilton swept into the lead to ensure Mercedes clinched their fifth consecutive world constructors’ championship.The win was far from one of the relentless dominance Hamilton has displayed in the second half of the season but he and the team did not allow it to dampen their ardour for a remarkable achievement.With Hamilton’s fifth drivers’ title clinched in Mexico, Mercedes have now equalled Ferrari’s record of five consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championship doubles the Scuderia scored with Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004.“We’ve just won the world championship for the fifth time so that’s real history in the making for the team,” he said. “If I was to stop today, for example, Mercedes would always remember this day and that I was a part of it, and that’s cool.” The team principal, Toto Wolff, reflected the satisfaction his team felt after they had been pushed harder than at any other point in the turbo-hybrid era. “It was a very difficult season,” he said. “We had ups and downs, Ferrari came back strongly and Red Bull at the end but that makes the championship victory even more enjoyable.”But the race had been all about Verstappen, who could barely contain his fury by its close. Hamilton had started from pole and held his lead from the off but Mercedes could not push hard on their tyres as Red Bull’s race pace proved mighty and it quickly became clear the fight was with Verstappen.He had started from fifth but charged from the off, in short order passing Kimi Räikkönen, who finished third, Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas to take second within 10 laps. He then drove a masterful stint, managing his tyres and staying out for 16 more laps than Hamilton before his stop. It enabled him to emerge on the quicker, soft tyres, which paid off.Four laps later Hamilton was powerless to resist as the Dutchman’s extra grip allowed him to sweep past for the lead on the start-finish straight.He quickly pulled away and the race was clearly in Verstappen’s hands until on lap 44 he was hit by Esteban Ocon at turn two, causing him to spin and drop five seconds to Hamilton and damage his floor. Ocon was a lap down and trying to unlap himself, an unnecessary risk against the race leader who was in front through the corner. “What a fucking idiot,” was Verstappen’s response. Ocon was given a stop-go penalty for the incident, cold comfort for Verstappen as Hamilton was able to hold his lead to the flag.The Dutchman was understandably furious, a mood that had clearly not improved by the end of the race and the situation looked like flaring up as he repeatedly shoved Ocon in the weigh-in area. “We are passionate about the sport, it would be odd if I shook his hand,” he said. When asked about the incident later he was terse: “I don’t really have a lot to comment on that, except that he was being a pussy”. Both drivers were subsequently summoned to the stewards and Verstappen was punished with two days of public service at the direction of the FIA.He was backed by the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner. “As a lapped car you should not interfere with the leader,” he said. “What was Ocon thinking of there, it beggars belief. It makes no sense at all.”He also defended his driver’s post‑race actions. “Esteban was lucky to get away with a push, to be honest. Max has lost a victory through no fault of his own. It is hugely frustrating to lose a victory through a back marker.”For Hamilton, however, the win was all as he and the team rightly celebrated. The record book will show only the victory and one that maintains an extraordinary record that illustrates his dominance for half a decade. He has now averaged 10 wins every season since 2014. Verstappen once again proved his credentials but ultimately the weekend belonged to Hamilton and Mercedes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e462806f149d0d3d68a0e6e27d3dc9395392962d/30_33_3439_2064/master/3439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=226d9bc6eabfc790249098d4db977e83","title":"joe root england winter content sri lanka","story":"After the Test win over Sri Lanka in Galle, England have the chance to polish a tarnished record while for Root the new-look side look easier to leadShow England’s Test team to the top of a ladder and they will look around for the nearest snake. But this tendency may just be fading: the victory in Galle was their fourth in a row, or, as cricketers are now contractually required to say, on the bounce. It took Joe Root’s record as captain to 11-9, still not great but getting there. If you’re an England fan any optimism has to be of the cautious variety but the next six Tests – two more in Sri Lanka, three in West Indies, one at home against Ireland – do look relatively comfy. For England, they are an invitation to polish an ugly record (only seven wins in the seven winters before this one, against 24 defeats). For Root they are an opportunity to make the captaincy, and the team, his own. A three-Test series can be brutal, allowing one side to prevail in about seven days flat. England have that chance and will seldom get a better one.Selection is like interior decorating: it doesn’t take a lot to create a new look. The XI for Galle showed only three changes from the Oval in September – Rory Burns, Ben Foakes and Jack Leach for Alastair Cook, Jonny Bairstow and Stuart Broad. But out went 343 Tests’ experience, to be replaced by just the one, Leach’s debut at Christchurch in March. Suddenly England went from three old lags to one (Jimmy Anderson) and from five ever‑presents under their present captain to only two – Anderson and Root himself. The consequence was that they were younger, fresher, faster in the field. The bowling did not suffer for the absence of Broad – his usurper, Leach, took four thrifty wickets – and the team looked easier to lead, as Broad often sounds more like a captain than Root and is not shy of showing it.There is a case for Broad to come straight back in, as the surface in Kandy may be damp, suggesting a fourth seamer rather than the third spinner. And there are those who would bring back Bairstow too, at No 3, to stiffen the top order and give Moeen Ali a rest after a long bowl. But who would make way? Bairstow’s understudy, Foakes, performed like a leading man. His keeping was silky it was he, not Burns, who took on the mantle of Cook and he didn’t just play proper creekit, as widely noted – he played the situation, following his century with a pre-declaration cameo, 37 off 34 balls. Everybody else chipped in, except the other debutant, Burns, and the old master Anderson. The spin trio worked perfectly, for once. Root said it would be a difficult selection meeting before Kandy, but from a distance it looks a dead simple one. To paraphrase Colin Cowdrey’s line about whether to put the opposition in, Root and Trevor Bayliss should think about changing the XI, and then decide not to.This England XI, cannily reconstructed by Ed Smith, consists of about 16 players (eight batters, six bowlers, two keepers), yet they still do not have a top three. One element fell into place in Galle, as Keaton Jennings finally repaid the selectors’ faith by reverse‑sweeping his way to 46 and 146 not out. Burns took Jennings’s old role, making a shaky nine and 23, but rightly will be given time to settle. Moeen managed a rare feat for a No 3, contributing fewer runs (three) than wickets (eight). With Root having an off-match by his standards, England stumbled to 72 for three and 74 for three. This is an all too familiar frailty. Over the past three years their most prolific batting position has been No 7, with an average of 47 and seven hundreds (two more than have been made by No 2, No 3 and No 5 between them). They are unlikely to get away with it against Australia next summer.The weather in Galle was not too bad but, for the hosts, it was a perfect storm: one captain sacked, another injured two giants recently gone, a third under suspicion of match‑fixing their only sorcerer bowing out, his apprentice accused of chucking the manager, understandably, deciding he could take no more. There is only one way for the stand-in captain, Suranga Lakmal, to go: tell his young team they have nothing to lose show some nerve with the field settings, giving England fewer singles, tying them down and stoking their impatience have a word with the batsmen about turning 30s into centuries: if Foakes and Jennings can do it, so can they."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c85eaed083af44347d90fb89815ca7ef7c821d7d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbb73a70cf4c6628d0727b101788878","title":"rugby union talking points second round autumn internationals","story":"England take heart from All Blacks defeat, Springboks’ power will test Scotland’s growing optimism and Italy prove a point In 2012 England also went 15-0 up on New Zealand at Twickenham and went on to win 38-21. This time they could not score a point after the 25th minute, instead allowing the All Blacks to snatch a 16-15 victory in a classic encounter of its type. Which team, though, is on the steeper upward curve? If the heavy rain was a leveller, there was no disguising the fact England, after a tough year, are on the way back. They now know they can ruffle the All Blacks, even with a patched-up pack, and South Africa’s two shuddering recent games against New Zealand also showed the world’s No 1 side are not invincible. Brodie Retallick may have had the last laugh at Twickenham but the All Black pack will have to dig deep again to avoid being ambushed in Dublin on Saturday. Robert KitsonAfter Scotland’s demolition of Fiji their coach, Gregor Townsend, warned an increasingly expectant Edinburgh public to be wary of the threat of South Africa who come to town on Saturday. Tommy Seymour became the first Scotland player to score a hat-trick of tries since Chris Paterson in 2004 but the wing will not have the freedom of Murrayfield if the Scotland forwards do not front up against the biggest pack in world rugby. The Springbok eight helped them recover from a 23-9 deficit at Stade de France and with the scrum-half Faf de Klerk back to direct things behind them they are a real force. It was a pulsating contest in Paris with the replacement hooker Bongi Mbonambi completing a late rally with a try in the dying seconds that helped South Africa to a 29-26 triumph. Mbonambi started the winning move with a throw to the lineout, joined a driving maul and finished off with a try in the corner. France remain maddeningly inconsistent. They face a dangerous Argentina in Lille on Saturday and, for all their attacking flair, this was a hard defeat for a demanding French public to take. Ian MalinSteve Hansen’s suspicion that Conor Murray could make his return from a neck injury against the All Blacks in Dublin on Saturday may be realised. The British \u0026amp Irish Lions scrum-half has not played since the summer and was left out of the Ireland squad for the autumn series but after a hard-earned 28-17 victory against Argentina, a record 10th in a row at home, Ireland’s coach admitted a comeback could not be ruled out. Joe Schmidt said: “I am going to chat to Conor to see how he is. It is highly unlikely he will be involved but I will talk to him and it will be his call.” Another 2017 Lion, the flanker Sean O’Brien, will miss out after breaking an arm in his first Test appearance for a year. Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki and Kieran Marmion face fitness tests. Paul ReesWith Italy continuing to underperform in the Six Nations the clamour from some to replace them with Georgia may continue but Conor O’Shea’s team silenced any debate in the sunshine in Florence with a 28-17 win over Georgia. It was the third meeting of the sides and Italy have won them all. Tommaso Allan may not be the steadiest of fly-halves but his talent is unquestionable. He rounded off the win by running in the fourth Italy try in some style. Michele Campagnaro, the Exeter centre, was particularly impressive while Braam Steyn up front was the man of the match as Italy bounced back from their defeat by Ireland in Chicago. The South Africa-born flanker helped Italy cope with Georgia’s physical onslaught and O’Shea will be optimistic he has a side who can give Scotland a real contest by the time they travel to Murrayfield for a Six Nations opener in February. IMScotland continue to be Dr Jekyll at home and Mr Hyde away. Their 54-17 win against Fiji at Murrayfield was their 10th in front of their own supporters in 11 Tests and the one defeat, a year ago, was against the All Blacks by five points. An improving South Africa will test that record on Saturday after their narrow defeat at Twickenham and comeback from 23-9 down against France on Saturday night. The return of Stuart Hogg and Finn Russell sharpened Scotland’s attack but Greig Laidlaw’s shrewdness and experience, at the end of a year that started when he was dropped for Ali Price, remain valuable commodities for a side whose burgeoning physicality will be tested by the heavyweight Springboks. PRThere may not have been a happy ending for England but the beginning was blissful. Less than two minutes had gone when the Sale wing, making his first start for four years, ran on to Ben Youngs’s lovely floated pass to splash down in the corner.France’s captain, Guilhem Guirado, emerged from the Stade de France dressing room late on Saturday night to say his team was “devastated” by their agonising 29-26 defeat against South Africa. “On the whole we were satisfied but we ruined things in the last minutes. The changing room is devastated. We had the match in our hands but we let it slip,” he said. France’s coach, Jacques Brunel, called the defeat – when they squandered a 14-point lead – “cruel”.Ireland’s 28-17 victory against Argentina came at a heavy cost. Joe Schmidt’s side have now won 10 successive games at the Aviva Stadium but the Ireland captain, Rory Bestm warned that his team would have to perform much better than this if they are to beat the All Blacks this Saturday. Ireland will face New Zealand without Sean O’Brien who broke his arm but Schmidt hinted that his talismanic scrum-half Conor Murray may return to the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff7034cfb4965bc89ac62355df5854d48889395/0_189_3978_2387/master/3978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd2b9209b5842ecca2516753ea250a4","title":"stephen fry live in heroes review hammersmith apollo london","story":"Hammersmith Apollo, LondonFry’s retelling of Greek myths makes for an engaging evening, but it takes Blackadder and Harry Potter to ignite the audienceHestia was the goddess of the hearth, and we’re gathered here tonight, Stephen Fry tells us, in tribute to her. So park those thoughts of Wodehousian repartee from telly’s favourite polymath. Suspend expectations of showbiz anecdote. This is about old-fashioned storytelling around the fire, says Fry. It may seem surprising that 3,500 people have assembled in Hammersmith for a lecture-cum-recital of Greek myths – but, that’s what it says on the tin, and that’s what they’re getting.The show marks the publication of Fry’s Heroes, the follow-up to Mythos, his 2017 compendium of tales from ancient Greece. Its opening half hour sets up his love affair with Zeus, Hercules and co, sketching out the cosmology for those of us bereft of a classical education. Not that Fry condescends: the several “as you probably knows” he inserts after telling us about this or that god or hero sound quite genuine.But it’s a relief when he moves on from this Olympian inventory, which feels like a lot of information. The stories that follow, he tells us, influenced everyone from Tolkien to JK Rowling to Marvel Comics – but in Fry’s retelling, they’re a little less epic. His Perseus meeting the Graeae sounds like Alan Bennett. Aethra telling Theseus the tale of his paternity is not shy of Carry On-style innuendo.They’re domesticated, then, but not revisionist. Fry tells the Medusa story with no acknowledgment of that myth’s blatant misogyny. He talks reverently about Promethean fire and human exceptionalism, about Icarus and the drive towards progress that the Greeks seeded at the heart of our civilisation. Sometimes he overreaches, straining for Armistice Day parallels between Theseus and the soldiers of the first world war.That section gets its biggest cheer when Fry brings Blackadder’s braying General Melchett momentarily to life. Elsewhere, there’s big audience love for an aside about reading the Harry Potter audiobook. It’s an engaging if not exciting evening around Fry’s hearth. His love radiates warmly from the stage for these tales of the heroic and the ine – even if his audience are most animated when, however briefly, he tells stories from closer to home.

They enable people to open their front door, access their office or start their car with a wave of their hand, and can also store medical data.Another company, Biohax of Sweden, also provides human chip implants the size of a grain of rice. It told the Sunday  (£) that it is in discussions with several British legal and financial firms about fitting their employees with microchips, including one major company with hundreds of thousands of employees.The CBI, which represents 190,000 UK businesses, voiced concerns about the prospect.A CBI spokesperson said: “While technology is changing the way we work, this makes for distinctly uncomfortable reading. Firms should be concentrating on rather more immediate priorities and focusing on engaging their employees.”The TUC is worried that staff could be coerced into being microchipped. Its general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “We know workers are already concerned that some employers are using tech to control and micromanage, whittling away their staff’s right to privacy.“Microchipping would give bosses even more power and control over their workers. There are obvious risks involved, and employers must not brush them aside, or pressure staff into being chipped.”Steven Northam, the founder and owner of Hampshire-based BioTeq, told the  that most of its 150 implants have been for iniduals, while some financial and engineering firms have also had the chips implanted in their staff.BioTeq has also implanted them in employees of a bank testing the technology, and has shipped them to Spain, France, Germany, Japan and China.They cost between £70 and £260 per person. Northam himself and all the directors at BioTeq and one of his other companies, IncuHive, have been microchipped.Last year Wisconsin-based Three Square Market partnered with Biohax and became the first company in the US to microchip its employees, on a voluntary basis.KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms, said it was not planning to microchip its employees and “would under no circumstances consider doing so”.Fellow accounting firms EY and PwC also said they would not consider microchipping their employees. Deloitte declined to comment.Biohax has plans to open an office in London, according to its website. It claims 4,000 people have been microchipped, mostly in Sweden. It is working with the state-owned Swedish rail firm Statens Järnvägar, to allow its passengers to travel via chip implants rather than train tickets. Biohax did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d2e13cb0728049e3a564b2ada2810f9dae3e6d/732_740_3317_1990/master/3317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea084e7f20f49c524f52a6ee2e976edc","title":"dynasties review david attenborough chimpanzees leader david","story":"The opening episode of David Attenborough’s new series follows the power struggles within a troop of chimpanzees and reveals just how little ides us from our primate cousinsThey say that the first person who will live to 200 has already been born. We tend to think this means recently born, but what if – as every sign seems to suggest – it’s David Attenborough? What if being born into privilege (that’s not meant as snide commentary – just an acknowledgement of fact) and spending the 70-odd years of your working life doing something you love and that, by its very nature, kept you mentally and physically fit while western medicine and other technologies developed all the miracles you might need to aid you in your progress … Maybe you would need never die?For when he goes, the sky shall be rent asunder and every mountain and island whose flora and fauna he has spent his life documenting shall move out of their places. In short, it will be a big thing.Dynasties (BBC One), a quintet of episodes four years in the making and devoted to the five most celebrated and endangered species on Earth, is his own most recent big thing. Although it has possibly been slightly diminished by the simultaneous announcement of his collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund and Netflix to narrate the eight-episode Our Planet next year.Last night’s opening episode was about chimpanzees because – and you know this is true – they’re the best. Next week is penguins, who are obviously great, and lions, tigers and wolves will all get their day in the documentary sun. But chimps they’re the best.Using the work of anthropologist Jill Pruetz, who has been studying the animals for 20 years to understand their power games and politics, the Dynasties team follow a troop of chimpanzees in Senegal, west Africa, and its alpha male David’s determination to hang on to his leadership as rivals gather. (Note: I shall be drawing no analogies. It would be exhausting.)At first, we are treated to a run-through of all the classics. Baby chimps splash and frolic at watering holes. Mothers watch indulgently. Adults dextrously poke grass stems into termite mounds and munch thoughtfully on the bugs they catch. But David can never let his guard down. He keeps a particular eye on young males Luthor and Jumkin, the most likely contenders for his crown. His toes twitch whenever they edge too close. A strategic alliance with another male – older than David and no challenger, but still powerful – via some literal back-scratching, is enough to repel one attempted coup, but next time David is not so lucky. After a fire and under pressure from a drought and the coming of several females into season – events, dear boy, events – David’s toes start to twitch again. In the night, the troop’s young males turn on him. His toes no longer twitching, fingers missing, great gouges in his flesh and foam dried to a white crust around his mouth, he looks to have been killed.Incredibly, he is still alive. The females and children lick his wounds until the group has to leave in search of water. And, while Luthor sets about instilling fear and panic in the group so that he can shore up his position as – why do I want to call it president? – David slowly regains enough strength to follow them. And when he finds them, Luthor runs. David is restored to fragile power without a blow being struck. He makes a few more allies, the better to protect himself next time – and there will always be a next time – gets a female pregnant and nine months later has a son. David is now the longest-reigning alpha male in the group’s known history.If you have any scrap of humility in you it is impossible to look from them to us and back again and not shake your head in something between wry resignation and simple despair at how little we have managed to change over the thousands of generations that stand – you would think significantly – between us. Dress it up with elections, referendums, ballot boxes, agrarian farming, industrial economies, marriage ceremonies, religion and Deliveroo all you want we are still all just animals fighting over resources and angling for the power that will get us more than our fair share. The chimps’ honesty in their operations only makes them seem the more civilised.Hominid, know thyself. And may Attenborough reign as long as David."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c8dea1402c519d94b837bdd72f40efef10a4f4/0_243_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d26b4bcd1b30b4eda18a130cefe6ab3b","title":"i was preety much mute at school the bake offs kim joy","story":"Her animal biscuits and warm personality delighted audiences. She talks about social anxiety, her work in mental healthcare and the surprising therapy of bakingKim-Joy’s house lies down a wiggly lane between Leeds and York, “a mystical place off the radar,” she says. Right now, it is full Bake Off, her table taken up by the giant “goodbye” cake contestants are given when they leave (she came joint second, of course), her shelves laden with different flours, in chic, labelled glazed pottery. The kitchen gives out on to huge fields at the back, a completely undreamed of scene of peace, with the world’s two free-rangiest chickens. “I think my neighbour might have a horse,” Kim-Joy says, dreamily. “How can you think someone might have a horse?” I ask. She gives me a smile as warm and perceptibly calm as the one that had such a soothing effect on the Bake Off tent, uncurdling every dicey batter.I’m not saying Rahul shouldn’t have won Bake Off he has distinctive qualities of his own. But Kim-Joy is such an unusual person for the public eye, so self-effacing, so restrained and undramatic, give or take the eyeliner, that she could have had a prize in her own category: Balm to the Nation’s Psyche.“People who are bakers always tend to be nice people, just because they want to give to other people,” she says, and it’s true – you don’t see many people making cakes for themselves, except in romcoms. “How can you bake and not be nice?” she adds.That is perhaps what drives Bake Off, the delightful contradictions of making competitors out of people who, by their nature, collaborate yet this isn’t the first niche competitive scenario to change Kim-Joy’s life. She is also into board games, and recently came second in a Splendor tournament. The board-games world “is quite male dominated,” she says, “so if you look really girly, people think you don’t know what you’re doing.” This is how she met Nabil, her partner, the inspiration behind the bee-decorated doughnuts she made on the show. He owns four board-game shops in the centre of Leeds, and she met him at a board-game club night, because, yes, those really exist.They played board games for a year and a half before anything happened – “Azul, that’s quite a good strategic game” – and he got to know of her fondness for baking, and “mentioned to me casually one day: ‘It’d be really nice if you made something for me.’ And I was all casual, too, and said: ‘I’ll do that sometime.’ And I came in the next day with my bread. It was a brioche, a couronne, filled with sun-dried tomatoes and basil. I was sharing it round everybody and he didn’t think they were appreciating it enough. And he said: ‘I want all this for me.’” It’s like a love story co-written by Jilly Cooper and Delia Smith.Her home’s other recurring theme, besides the baking, is the Japanese animation, My Neighbour Totoro, with illustrations of the giant grey-furred woodland sprite everywhere. They also remind her of Nabil. “I thought he reminded you of a bee?” I say. “He reminds me of a lot of cute things,” she says.Kim-Joy became known on the show for her intense commitment to cuteness: anything that could be an animal would be she could see the rabbit potential in every shape. She won star baker in vegan week with a lavender and lemon cake decorated with foxes, alongside some squirrel tartlets. Then there was her galaxy-themed chocolate ball that melted to reveal a gang of space turtles carrying tiny umbrellas. Her famous bunny madeleines in the semi-final were so dinky, it felt like vandalism to watch one disappear into Paul Hollywood. But the genius of the casting is that, from the first episode, it always looked as if there was something real underneath, that it was a kind of cartoon generosity, not tweeness, driving it.Her other star baker week was the spice round. Ginger biscuits are a risky game: make them once and everyone calls you a genius make them twice, and everyone says you’re playing it safe. She makes them a third time, for me, in animal shapes (of course), and it all happens so smoothly that, from where I am standing, it just goes from a clean kitchen back to a clean kitchen that smells of baking ginger, without any mess in between. To watch her decorate is mesmerising, tiny piping bags of royal icing lined up like fat little fondant mice, delicacy and perfectionism shot through with zen-like chill.Before Bake Off, Kim-Joy was a psychological wellbeing practitioner, having done a master’s in psychology. “The technical job role was to help people with low to moderate anxiety and depression,” she says. She is always careful not to come across as critical, and never more so than when she talks about her work. “I love the NHS. I really want to work in the NHS, but I’m at a point where the clinical side of mental health isn’t for me. You do a questionnaire with each person when they come in. So they tell you how many times that week they’ve felt low, which is a really weird question. It’s not real. Professionals need it for their data, to see who’s recovering. A lot of people just make up their answers, because they want to sound like they’re feeling better.”She is at a crossroads, wanting to carry on working in mental health, but “there’s a big emphasis on diagnosis, and I know there’s a place for diagnosis, but a lot of the time, people don’t fit into those boxes. And it’s helpful, so that people can get the right treatment, but not if the diagnoses don’t fit. I’d love to combine baking with mental health. Art therapy is a thing, isn’t it? Why not baking therapy?”She has done very little work with children, so it was a Bake Off revelation to discover that “quite a few children seem to like me. I’ve had so many drawings from children. I didn’t really see that coming.” I suggest it is because she is quite high-energy without getting in your grill, which children like but adults can’t often manage. “I think I’m quite low-energy, generally. I just like to chill and be at home and bake. It’s just because you’re here, I’ve put some energy on.”The animals she has made – well, a cat, some stars, I think it’s a bell and her signature turtle – are out of the oven, but need time to cool before icing. She was born 27 years ago to an English father and Malaysian mother in Belgium, but that’s not the source of her patisserie skill: she moved back to the outskirts of London aged nine, none of her family bakes, and she didn’t really take it up until she went to university. “All I remember of baking as a kid was having to make mince pies, which I really hated. So it’s not really a fun baking story.” She started in earnest, she says simply, because: “If you make something, it makes people like you. It’s just about making people happy, I guess. I got into the decorative side of it later.“I didn’t really speak when I was at school, I was pretty much mute. I would talk at home, and sometimes I whispered to people, but I was very careful about who could hear me talk I didn’t want people to know that I could. I would say it was severe social anxiety. There’s selective mutism as well, but a lot of that is in really young children, and this was at secondary school. So I don’t know if I fit the criteria. But I don’t really believe in criteria anyway. I was always trying to break out of my shell because I knew that wasn’t really me. But who was?”That carried on at university, where she chose a course almost at random, and went off, hoping to throw herself into socialising. “I thought: ‘I’m just going to start being me.’ But when I got there, I really didn’t know how to talk to people, I’d not interacted that much. I would just say really weird things. I started making friends by baking. And I’ve got a lot more normal as time’s gone on.” In her descriptions of the whole TV experience, there is a residue of this social anxiety – worrying that the other contestants would hate her, being astonished when they turned out to be really warm – but what her backstory illuminates is the intense sympathy she gives off, in person and on screen. People always say, on the internet, be kind, you never know what other people are going through but it’s not often you meet someone who seems quite so alive to what other people might be going through.The impact of her new stardom is subtle. Unlike some contestants, she hasn’t had photographers on her doorstep, possibly because it is quite hard to find, although she is recognised a lot – indeed, even if you had only seen the show once, you couldn’t mistake her for anyone else, so she has to look “put together” when she goes out, although I think her pure sunshine wardrobe predates her time on telly. Her extended family in Malaysia are incredibly excited. “My aunt Sandra keeps screenshotting the Daily Mail, and I really don’t want to know about the Daily Mail.” The show has evolved pastoral care: “Someone rings you every few days just to have a chat. And I think that carries on for quite a while. She called us throughout the whole show, and still calls now. I’ve not needed any support. But sometimes you can’t really tell with people, they surprise you.”But Bake Off has left its mark. “I feel like I want to make the most of the opportunities, I don’t want to just sit back and chill the whole time. To have people like you for who you are is quite affirming, especially when you always worry about people not liking you.”When you watch someone excelling at something – anything – while being so modest about it, they’re hard not to like. “I am modest,” she says, “but I think Rahul is more modest. If it came across the other way, it’s because I always expected things to go badly in the tent, not to be as good as it was at home, so if something went wrong in the tent, I didn’t really talk about it. Whereas Rahul expected everything to be perfect, because that’s how it was at home.”She has just finished icing one star, having wiped off a previous attempt that already looked more or less perfect. “Can I have a break for a bit?” “Sure, a break from baking, or a break from me?” “From baking,” she says, and it was the wrong question and a diplomatically wrong answer, but it is fine, because I was leaving in a bit anyway, and I cannot help being high-energy and in your grill.She gives me the turtle to take home. On the train – because I want to show it to people and also eat it – I lay it on my skirt to take a photo, and realise she has iced it exactly to match. It could be a coincidence, except my skirt is mad: lime green, black, white, coral. Hers is a delicate, unassuming kind of empathy you don’t meet it every day.Prep 15 minCook 10-12 min (Plus decorating time – depends on how many biscuits you are decorating)Makes About 12 medium-sized biscuitsFor the biscuits150g salted butter (or use unsalted and add salt to taste)100g dark muscovado sugar25g liquid molasses2 tbsp beaten egg1 tbsp ground ginger¾ tbsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground cloves225g plain flour, plus extra to dust and roll outFor the royal icing450g icing sugar2 medium egg whites (or you can use 70g pasteurised egg whites if you are concerned about using raw egg whites)Plus extra icing sugar andor egg white to adjust – the consistency you are aiming for is one that returns to a smooth surface about 15 seconds after running a knife through it.Food dyesPreheat oven to 180Cfan 160Cgas mark 4.Add the butter, sugar and molasses to a stand mixer bowl.

Everyone agrees that Martin Scorsese’s collaboration with Robert De Niro is one of the great movie double acts. But when laurels are scattered in its general direction (Raging Bull! Taxi Driver! Goodfellas!), few are spared for their tale of a sociopathic failed standup, The King of Comedy. Yet, you could argue that said feature film, 35 years old this year, is the pair’s most influential match-up. From People Just Do Nothing to This Country, survey today’s entertainment landscape and everywhere you see comedy that mainlines awkward pauses and excruciating faux pas. Raging Bull got the Oscars, but The King of Comedy anticipated a movement – cringe comedy – that has come to dominate TV and movie screens everywhere.Its high-water mark was in the early 2000s, with The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Sacha Baron Cohen’s oeuvre cultivating a new taste for squirmy humour. “Oh, it was horrific,” says Ali G and Borat co-writer and co-producer Dan Mazer, shuddering to recall his experiences with Baron Cohen. “Sometimes I couldn’t watch and had to extricate myself. Latterly, I couldn’t be on set: the discomfort overwhelmed me.” Viewers will recognise the feeling, and watch-through-the-fingers comedy has proliferated since. Nathan Fielder’s spoof business advice show Nathan for You or last year’s Palme d’Or-winning movie The Square are as toe-curling as anything Baron Cohen or Ricky Gervais made. The unforgiving gaze of cringe com is a key component in series as erse as Fleabag, Catastrophe and Lisa Kudrow’s cult hit The Comeback. What distinguished those mockumentaries with Baron Cohen, says Mazer, was that awkwardness was a means to an end: “We wanted to highlight injustice or satirise things, and awkwardness was the best way to do that.”It is no coincidence, says Ash Atalla – producer of The Office as well as newer cringe com hit People Just Do Nothing – that the genre’s early exponents worked in the faux-documentary format. Had The Office been a conventional sitcom, it wouldn’t have lingered so long on David Brent’s foot-in-mouth moments, or Tim’s fluffed passes at Dawn. “The essence of cringe comedy,” he says, “is that you don’t let your characters off the hook. In real life, and often in television, you look away. But with the mockumentary style, if a character is under pressure, you keep the lens on them.” Reality TV was an influence, too. “We hadn’t seen people behave as themselves on camera before,” says Atalla. “People didn’t realise how they would be perceived.”That developed an appetite for areas of human experience over which TV – comedy in particular – had hitherto drawn a veil. “It’s about what we demand from TV,” says Atalla, citing a wider impulse towards authenticity. “To get a character to walk into a room, say something funny, then walk out feels manufactured now. Traditional comedy didn’t show people being sad, it didn’t show those difficult, slow-motion car-crash moments. That all changed with The Office.” The intention wasn’t to make people cringe, he says, but to make space in comedy for experiences that hadn’t belonged there: “The by-product is that people will feel awkward watching it, because you feel you shouldn’t be.”But why do we want to feel awkward – and why do we find it funny? In her new book Cringeworthy: How to Make the Most of Uncomfortable Situations, Melissa Dahl explores our experience of awkwardness, drawing on cringe comedy to do so. When we watch something embarrassing, she says, we feel – according to neurological research – that it is happening to us. “Which is so tense and weird,” says Dahl, “that we laugh to release the tension.” She also has theories for the timing of cringe comedy’s rise. On the one hand, it’s because “the world is changing faster than ever” – and so are social mores – and therefore “there are more opportunities for all of us to put our foot in our mouth. These shows play out that social horror on screen.”Then there is social media. Dahl’s theory of awkwardness, expounded in Cringeworthy, is that “we feel awkward when we are trying to present ourselves in a way that is incompatible with how we really are. And – because of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram – we have never been so cognisant of our self-presentation as we are now.”By that reckoning, cringe comedy is the ideal artform to help us navigate bewildering new interpersonal realities. Dan Mazer doesn’t necessarily agree he wonders whether cringe com has already burned out. “Is it a thing any more? I think young people nowadays are more sensitive. Popular comedies now, like Girls or Atlanta, are all quite touchy-feely, kind, socially conscious.” However, both shows have also been described as cringe comedies: they may be touchy-feely, but squirming awkwardness is among the things they touch and feel.Yet Mazer’s point may stand: the comedy of discomfort barely needs its own genre because it has colonised all the others. Thirty-five years on from The King of Comedy, “this is a type of comedy that will exist for ever,” reckons Atalla. “Of course, there’s still Mrs Brown’s Boys. But beyond that, there isn’t much room in the schedules for the escapist and silly. Catastrophe, People Just Do Nothing, Fleabag,” he says, reeling off the list. “Cringe comedy is where the momentum is.”Myq Kaplan“I was once on the subway with a pair of new headphones – they were Bluetooth-connected and sound-cancelling. I was listening to a podcast and, for whatever reason, I couldn’t hear it, so I kept hitting the volume button but could still only hear it faintly. Eventually I took one of the headphones out and I realised it had been playing out loud, to the carriage, just booming out through my phone speaker to the whole train. It was a podcast about relationships, and the thing that was playing the moment I realised my phone was not connected to the headphones was the words “clitoral stimulation”. The buttons wouldn’t seem to stop, so I powered the phone down and just sat looking down in silence until the doors opened and I zoomed off. Then I lived in a new home and never went on the train again.”Nina Conti“Knowing how my act can go, it was a punchy call to agree to do a bar mitzvah in a posh London hotel. I didn’t know the family, but they’d asked for me specifically and assured me I should do my usual thing. There were lots of kids there, so I thought I’d keep it clean but play to the adults and the kids could enjoy the funny visuals. I attached the Velcro straps of my ventriloquist face mask around the locks of a family member from the head table and went sailing off into an improv about how she was on the prowl for a new man: “No man in here is safe from me now, cos I’m leaving my boring husband!” It didn’t go down well. The woman stiffened beneath the mask as it started to seem more like a muzzle. Maybe not the best seam to plough on regardless, but worse to find out later I had stumbled on a truth, of which lots of the guests were aware.”Liam Williams“Asking me to recount my most awkward moment ever is rather like asking a duck’s back to recount its wettest water ever. Often I’ve brought awkwardness upon myself by, for example, relieving myself from the side of a rowing boat in plain sight of a riverbank of families. Otherwise, awkwardness has found me, as when I was laughed at by a room of adults for drawing a wonky stave on a blackboard during a childhood guitar lesson. These days, a reformed yob and non-guitarist, I barely register awkwardness at all, ennobled as I am by my mortifying climate as the penguin is ennobled by cold air.”People Just Do Nothing starts Monday 12 November, 10pm, BBC Two Nathan for You continues Thursday 15 November, 11.30pm, Comedy Central"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef377a4072516d6b1c0d8ae75cf1326c7753037a/0_477_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14013573d89d3c3bd409fb25daba218","title":"the zinke effect how the us interior department became a tool of industry","story":"Trump’s interior secretary has been remaking the agency charged with protecting public lands as an ally of big energySince his first day on the job, when he surrounded himself with a National Park Service police escort and rode through Washington DC on a white-nosed horse named Tonto, the US interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, has exhibited a flair for ostentation.Not long after taking office in March 2017, the new secretary started flying a special flag, adorned with the agency’s bison seal, above the interior department’s elegant New-Deal-era headquarters. At a cost of more than $2,000, he also commissioned commemorative coins emblazoned with his name to hand out to visitors and staff. He replaced the doors in his office to the tune of more than $130,000, and installed a hunting-themed arcade game in the department’s cafeteria.Yet to some longtime civil servants working at interior headquarters, this flashy behavior was merely a distraction from graver concerns.“There was a lot of eye-rolling and embarrassment about the flag and the horse and all of the ridiculousness,” said a former senior employee who left last year and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. For some, the dominant emotional tenor at the time was “fear and anxiety” as Zinke and his team ushered in “dramatic change” at the interior department.“All the new administration was interested in was their checklist for dismantling regulations and weakening environmental and land use protections,” said the former staffer. “Instead of asking why a senator or lobbyist or CEO was asking for a special favor and whether or not it was allowed under the law, this administration wanted to know why the special favor wasn’t already done and which deep state employee was standing in the way.”Despite his public persona as a folksy Montanan with a Boy Scout’s penchant for pennants and horses, Zinke has taken shrewd and aggressive steps to transform from the inside a department whose 70,000 employees manage the country’s treasured national parks and its endangered species, in addition to overseeing vast energy and mineral deposits on at least 500m acres of public land.Most importantly, Zinke rapidly installed a slew of conservative operatives and industry sympathizers in key positions throughout the agency. Because these senior advisers, counselors, and other appointees are rarely subject to Senate approval, few people know their names. They nevertheless wield immense power and are responsible for much of the day-to-day work at the interior department.Hundreds of pages of correspondence and calendars reviewed by the  and Pacific Standard show how Zinke and his top aides have favored corporate and conservative calls to prioritize resource extraction at the expense of conservation, while consistently delivering on industry desires – despite sometimes running afoul of conflict of interest rules.The interior department responded to only one of multiple inquiries made to it, saying through a spokesperson that “the Department has addressed these questions to you and other reporters on multiple occasions. Our position remains unchanged.”Zinke is now facing a swirl of misconduct allegations, and Trump has said he would make a decision on his future at the department as soon as this week. But whatever Zinke’s fate, he has stocked the department with a slate of committed conservative appointees who will continue to remake the agency in the image of the Trump administration.“They are undermining the department’s mission at every turn,” said one current high-level civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “I have been here a pretty long time and seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle,” the civil servant added, “but this is the worst I have ever seen.”During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump made no secret of his ambition to exploit the American landscape. “A Trump administration will develop an American first energy plan,” he said in a 2016 speech before the North Dakota Petroleum Council. “American energy dominance will be declared a strategic, economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.”The US controls enormous publicly-owned energy resources, from the underwater oil wells of the Gulf of Mexico to the gas fields of North Dakota and the uranium deposits of Arizona. The interior department is the agency that decides who can drill and mine these riches.Zinke has styled himself, at least superficially, after Theodore Roosevelt, the progressive-era president who helped create America’s modern conservation system. But Zinke has veered sharply from Roosevelt’s legacy.Where Roosevelt created the nation’s first national monuments, Zinke drastically reduced the size of Bears Ears national monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Utah last year in what amounted to the largest rollback of protected public lands in American history.More broadly, over the last fiscal year, the department has sought to lease a stunning 12.8m acres of publicly-owned oil and gas parcels to private companies.And while Roosevelt railed against powerful special interests, Zinke has a cozy relationship with industry groups. The monument reductions occurred after Zinke was pressured by conservative groups such as the Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity and energy companies such as the uranium firm Energy Fuels Inc. In fact, during Zinke’s first 18 months in office he met repeatedly with oil and gas industry organizations that have collectively given him more than $110,000 in political contributions over the course of his career, according to a report from the Western Values Project.Zinke’s top deputies also have a close relationship with extractive industries. During their first year and a half on the job, just seven of Zinke’s high-level political appointees collectively participated in at least 280 meetings, calls or gatherings with fossil fuel corporations, mining companies or related advocacy groups, according to calendars obtained via public records requests and analyzed by the  and Pacific Standard. Meetings with conservative ideological organizations, agricultural and timber groups, and corporate lobbying and law firms also appeared regularly on the officials’ calendars.These extractive interests had more than twice as much access as conservation NGOs, which obtained at least 115 meetings and calls with the seven officials within the same timeframe.At a private energy summit that took place in Washington DC last December, a Zinke appointee named Timothy Williams articulated the department’s pro-industry agenda, according to documentation of his remarks reported here for the first timeWilliams dismissively characterized the approach taken by the administration of Barack Obama: “Anything you want to do on public land, they want to see what the carbon footprint is and what the social cost is.” Under Zinke, “we’re not looking at this”, he said. The new administration is instead focused on “economic impacts”. It is bent on changing “the mindset of the bureaucrats”.From the very beginning, however, Zinke’s interior appointees appear to have violated Trump’s own ethics directives intended to “drain the swamp”.According to rules put in place by the Trump administration, officials are supposed to be prohibited for a period of two years from the date of their appointment from having meetings with former employers, with few exceptions, and interior department guidelines recommend that officials take steps to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest when performing their official duties.Williams, for instance, previously worked for Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a Koch brothers-funded organization committed to combating government regulations of all kinds, including environmental protections. But soon after joining the department as the deputy director of the office of intergovernmental and external affairs, his office reached out to AFP to hold a meeting, according to records obtained by the investigative group Documented. “Happy to meet to discuss partnering on shared priorities,” Chrissy Harbin, then the AFP vice-president, replied in an email.In another case, the political appointee Douglas Domenech met twice in April 2017 with representatives of his former employer, the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another Koch-linked conservative foundation. According to his work calendar, the subject of the meeting was a pair of active lawsuits the organization had filed against agencies within the interior department concerning endangered species and property rights – the meetings appear to be a glaring conflict of interest. Little more than six months after its meetings with Domenech, TPPF had what it described as a “major win” when it settled one of those lawsuits.There are “express prohibitions” on such meetings in the White House’s own ethics pledge, said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. “These high-level officials are supposed to be setting the tone for the entire department and this shows a complete disregard for the ethics rules put in place by the administration.” and Pacific Standard have uncovered several instances in which interior department leadership has coordinated closely with industry-aligned groups on crucial legal and regulatory decisions, with profound consequences for efforts to combat climate change, wildlife management and other matters.Zinke’s department plays a major role in the regulation of methane which, for the first 20 years after it is introduced into the atmosphere, is over 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The interior department under Barack Obama moved to clamp down on a principal source of domestic methane pollution – the wasteful leaking, venting and flaring of methane by oil and gas companies. In late 2016, just before Obama left office, the interior department finalized a new federal regulation that required oil and gas drillers operating on public land to take stringent steps to detect and capture methane waste.Influential oil and gas industry trade groups like the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) were opposed to the measure, and sued in late 2016 to block what it considered a “regulatory onslaught on American producers”. During the first months of the Trump administration, Republicans led an industry-backed effort to repeal the methane rule using the Congressional Review Act, a law that enables Congress and the president to roll back recently issued regulations.The repeal effort soon ran into trouble, however, when Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, publicly came out against it in the spring of 2017.Emails reveal how the interior department and oil industry coordinated a response. “Really?” wrote interior official Micah Chambers, in a frustrated March 2017 note to Ryan Ullman, the IPAA’s director of government relations, upon learning of Graham’s opposition.“I’m disappointed to put it very politely,” Ullman responded. Ullman asked whether the department would wheel out Zinke to make the case for getting rid of the regulation.Graham did not change his mind about the methane rule and the Senate ultimately voted against repealing the regulation. Zinke’s department soon took matters into its own hands. The department tried twice in 2017 to block methane regulation by itself, but both times it was stymied by legal challenges from environmentalist groups and state governments.A political appointee named Katharine MacGregor helped lead the department’s handling of the issue. Her calendar shows several meetings with fossil-fuel industry groups in the summer and fall of 2017, including one about methane just a few hours before an internal interior department meeting on the same subject.In September this year, MacGregor announced that the department had decided to rewrite the rule entirely, rather than merely block it. The revision effectively rolled it back.Chase Huntley, the energy and climate program director at The Wilderness Society, said his organization held several meetings with top interior officials, and it became apparent to him that their minds were already made up: the gutting of the methane rule was a preordained outcome.“It seems clear that the methane rule rollback, while arbitrary, was a foregone conclusion from day one of this administration”, he said. It was rooted “in a philosophical and policy allegiance to the industry’s best interests”.Extractive industries also seem to have had a hand in the department’s implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which is regarded as one of the strongest environmental laws in the world but is the bane of some industry groups because it limits development in sensitive habitat.The interior department energy counselor, Vincent DeVito, for instance, appears to have helped delay Endangered Species Act protections last year for an imperiled freshwater mussel species in Texas at the behest of oil and gas interests. In mid 2017, the government relations director for the Independent Petroleum Association of America wrote in an e-mail to DeVito: “We really hope that you can intervene before this species gets listed next month.”When the species’ listing was delayed, the  and Pacific Standard have learned from records, the IPAA sent DeVito an email with the words: “THANK YOU!” DeVito has since left the department to work for an oil and gas company.The department has taken a controversial stance, too, on sage grouse, a chicken-size bird that dwells among the sprawling sagebrush plains of the American west. Even the slightest disturbance can drive the animal from its breeding and nesting grounds, and populations have plummeted in recent decades as oil and gas drilling, mining and other development has fractured its habitat.In 2015, the Obama administration unveiled protection plans for the species, including a proposal to prohibit new mining on 10m acres of federal land in the hope of avoiding disturbance. But after Trump’s election, the mining industry suddenly found itself with committed sympathizers within the interior development.A striking email chain reviewed by the  and Pacific Standard reveals that a mining industry advocate helped edit the wording of legislative language intended to block funding for these sage grouse conservation efforts.In one message from spring 2017, a Republican staffer with the Congressional Western Caucus named Jeff Small described producing the proposed text “after much discussion” with Laura Skaer, the executive director of the influential American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA). He sent an email to top officials at the interior department to run the legislative language past them too.Kathleen Benedetto, a senior advisor at the department, replied: “It will need to be modified”. That very day, a modified version of the language was suggested to a house committee by Republican congressman Paul Gosar. (A spokesperson for Gosar said that “it is common for us to solicit feedback from outside experts and impacted stakeholders”.)The Republican-led Congress ultimately failed to block funding for the proposed mining prohibition, however, and Zinke’s department once again took matters into its own hands. In June 2017, Zinke established a broad internal review of the Obama-era sage grouse conservation plans, naming Benedetto, previously the co-founder of the Women’s Mining Coalition, as “co-lead” of the effort.Over the course of the next four months, Benedetto’s calendar shows she had at least 16 meetings or calls with mining groups. In October 2017, the BLM, which Benedetto helps oversee, announced that the 10m acres would no longer be out of bounds for mining.The AEMA celebrated the victory, saying the interior department “has done the right thing by ending this epic federal land grab”.Since taking office, Zinke and his department have been subject to no fewer than 15 federal investigations. The interior department’s office of inspector general is probing his involvement in a Montana land deal with the chairman of the oil services company Halliburton. It is also looking into his role in blocking the development of a proposed casino involving two Native American tribes in Connecticut. In late October, the Washington Post reported that the the inspector general’s office referred one of its inquiries to the justice department for further investigation, though it did not specify which one.The secretary’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda, his team’s conflict of interests problems, and his own personal conduct are likely to draw intense scrutiny from Democrats once they take control of the House in January 2019. Already, congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona, who will likely take the reins as the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee next year, has vowed to call Zinke before the committee in order to interrogate him about his “failures and scandals”. Whether Zinke sticks around at the department is an open question, though many press reports indicate that he is preparing to step down from office.His political appointees, nevertheless, will likely remain. But they too acknowledge that they have a short timeframe in which to finish their work of fulfilling Trump’s energy dominance agenda.At the private Washington DC energy summit back in December, Timothy Williams admitted as much to his audience of conservative operatives and fossil-fuel advocates.“Obviously we are not going as fast as everybody wants, but at some point there will be an administration in here, an administration that is not friendly to your values, to you guys,” he said.“So bear with us,” he added later. “You guys should know that if you have any questions or any problems you feel free to contact me. That is my job. To work with industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d420d37e4e97150c880c51bafdd57057d95df7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fc62862089eeec38b282615d9d9dd8","title":"can they really pull it off the apec summit comes to papua new guinea","story":"Poorest country in bloc to host meeting of world leaders for first time – but some can’t even bring themselves to stay overnightIt is likely to end, as all Apec leaders summits do, with world leaders, including Xi Jinping, Mike Pence, Shinzo Abe, Justin Trudeau and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, donning matching shirts and posing awkwardly for a photo op.But this week world leaders will arrive in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, for an Apec unlike any other.This is the first time Papua New Guinea, the poorest country among the 21 countries of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) bloc, has hosted the summit.PNG ranks around 130th worldwide for GDP and 135th in the corruption perception index, and Port Moresby is consistently ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the world, which could be the reason that at least one leader – Mike Pence – will not be staying in the host country, but will be flying in and out from the Australian city of Cairns.The PNG government hopes that the nation will emerge with trade agreements and a new standing on the world stage, but the the arrival of thousands of people will test the country. The road to Apec has been a rocky and unconventional one, involving three cruise ships, 40 Maseratis and Hillary Clinton.Clinton, in fact, is where it all started, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program for the Lowy Institute, a Sydney thinktank.One story commonly told in Australian diplomatic circles is that the idea was first floated by the former US secretary for state in 2012 when she attended the Pacific Island Leaders Forum.A senior diplomatic figure familiar with the negotiations said while Clinton might have been keen, her government and the Australian government were not. “There were a lot of reservations and a lot of concerns about logistical capacity ... I recall a lot of dialogue between Washington and Canberra about it: can they really pull this off?”What is not in question is that the Papua New Guinean government wanted to host Apec.It was announced that PNG would host the summit in 2013, at a time the outlook for the country was bright, owing to a construction boom as a huge LNG project in the highlands of the country was being built.“GDP growth for that year in PNG was among the highest anywhere in the world, it was booming,” said Pryke.If PNG’s economy had followed the trajectory it seemed to be set on, then hosting Apec in 2018 could have been exactly what the country needed: a moment to announce itself on the world stage and an opportunity to promote private sector investment.However, just as the LNG facility was supposed to come online, the oil price plummeted. Since then a litany of problems have played out in the country, including an outbreak of polio, as well as sharp rises in the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis – and a struggling economy.Spending on Apec has been met with widespread anger across the country, culminating in Maserati-gate in October, after it was revealed the government had purchased 40 Maseratis and three luxury Bentleys for the summit. Diplomatic sources told Reuters that nearly all leaders attending the event would travel in special armoured vehicles, making it unclear what the sports cars will be used for.“There are a lot of people, not just in Port Moresby but around PNG who are outraged by the spending on Apec which seems to be extravagant,” said Martyn Namorong, a writer and activist in Port Moresby. “Many people feel it’s not been clearly articulated to them what the benefits of Apec will be.”The challenges of hosting Apec are significant. Alan Bollard, executive director of the Apec Secretariat estimates 5,000-7,000 people are expected to arrive in Port Moresby this week. Because of a lack of hotel rooms, the city has had to contract three cruise ships to be used as floating accommodation for media and other attendees.The US will be represented at the summit by Mike Pence who will not be staying in PNG, but will fly in from Cairns in Australia. He is the only leader confirmed not to be staying in PNG, but there are rumours other leaders may do the same.“It’s not a great look,” said Pryke of the US vice-president’s decision not to stay in the host country.While Pence’s short visit may offend, the fact that he, and not Donald Trump, is going to Apec is unlikely to ruffle feathers. “People are being fairly philosophical about it,” said Kemish. “It’s not the first time a US president hasn’t been to Apec. Pence actually has a bit of status around here, apparently he played a role in getting the old King James Bible into the country as a gift to the national parliament.”But the real love-fest of the summit is likely to be between PNG and China.“It’s already going to be the China show,” said Pryke. “Xi’s going for a long time … and he’s hosting a meeting with the Pacific Island leaders on the sideline of the leaders meeting and I imagine there will be a lot of big announcements – more investment, more aid.”China has already indicated its intentions to partner closely with the country, pledging to give the nation $3.94bn in aid and loan projects last year. This has concerned Australia, traditionally PNG’s closest partner. In the week before Apec, the Australian government announced AU$3bn in additional funding to the Pacific, which was widely seen as a move to counter China’s growing influence in the region.China provided significant infrastructure support to PNG ahead of Apec and Australia has contributed at least AU$130m, largely in the area of security. Diplomatic sources say this was something Australia was keen to do, particularly in order to keep the Chinese military out of PNG, which at its closest point is just 4km from Australia.Commentators are unanimous that for Apec to be a success requires more than just an incident-free summit.“PNG has an opportunity to drive forward a range of significant economic projects and send a message to the international investor community that it is competitive and truly part of the global community,” said Kemish.“There’s no turning back now, the toothpaste is out of the tube,” said Pryke. “It’s in everyone’s interests for this to be a success, however you want to define it, and also for it just to be done. It has been a huge distraction, both financially and on the bureaucracy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba2c4fc977271a04b6e450e16c4352e8dae6ff19/83_0_3312_1987/master/3312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2ccbe84e53422282fdd3c47788d571","title":"italy to host libyan conference in fresh push for elections","story":"Palermo meeting shows Italy’s determination to regain diplomatic control from FranceMany of Libya’s leading factions will meet on Monday in Palermo, southern Italy, in an effort to reunite the country’s institutions and find a new path to elections that a previous French-convened conference failed to achieve.The two-day conference symbolises an Italian determination to regain diplomatic responsibility for Libya after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, convened a surprise summit in Paris in May in a bid to push for Libyan elections on 10 December.Italy, in the midst of forming a government at the time, was aghast at Macron unilaterally trying to stamp his brand on Libya. Politicans believed such as swift timetable was designed to benefit Gen Khalifa Haftar, the anti-Islamist strongman in Libya’s east, rather than the UN-backed government in Tripoli.France argued at the time that the UN’s efforts to create peace were stalling, and a new initiative was needed to galvanise all sides.The Palermo summit has revealed tensions inside the Italian government, with the Italian foreign ministry and the UN not informed by the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conti, before the summit was announced.The UN special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, last week tried to wrest back control of the agenda by acknowledging that the widely derided timetable could not be met, instead proposing a conference in the first weeks of 2019 leading to “an electoral process starting in 2019”.Muammar Gaddafi was ousted as president in 2011 after more than 40 years in power. But deep ision between his supporters and adversaries persisted. An internationally recognised National Transitional Council took over, but quickly succumbed to schism, particularly between east and west.The transitional authorities found it impossible to extend their writ across the whole country, which was splintering into myriad factions: former regime loyalists, revolutionary brigades, local militia, Islamists, old army units, tribes, people trafficking gangs.A General National Congress was elected in 2012 and established itself in Tripoli. But when a national parliament was elected in 2014, the GNC refused to accept the result the new body had to install itself in the eastern city of Tobruk. Libya now effectively had two governments - the former buttressed by Islamist militias in its Tripoli stronghold, the latter supported by Khalifa Haftar, a renegade army colonel now head of the armed forces.Libya has become too unsafe for diplomats and most aid workers. The UN pulled its staff out in 2014 and foreign embassies followed suit. Tripoli international airport is largely destroyed by fighting.The conflict has killed 5,000, ruined the economy, driven half a million from their homes and trapped hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to get north to Europe in a nightmarish network of brutal camps. Diplomatic attempts at reconciliation have proven fruitless thus far.But the chances of success for the Palermo summit were dealt a blow when Haftar, the leading figure in Libya’s east, announced at the last minute he would not attend, citing the presence of Qatar, “and other supporters of al-Qaida” at the event. Italian sources said efforts were being made to make him reconsider.Libya has been gripped by violence, corruption and political isions, buttressed by outside powers, since Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed in a Nato-backed uprising in 2011. Italy has been broadly supportive of the UN-recognised government, based in Tripoli, that has had support of Islamist factions to which the Egypt-backed Haftar, the United Arab Emirates and France are opposed. Italian interest in Libya is based on its colonial history, oil and its base as a route for thousands of African migrants. Libya specialist at the European council for foreign relations, Tarek Megerisi, said: “This whole conference has to be seen primarily as a power play by the Italians against the French. They hoped to make it larger than the Paris summit to show it had greater legitimacy, but with each iteration its scale has been diminished, and the number of senior foreign ministers attending is in doubt. From the UN point of view, the summit will be regarded a success if it leads to greater unification of Europe’s position, including EU support for the UN plan for a national conference leading to elections.”He said Europe should focus on a small number of objectives at the summit, including unifying the two rival central banks, re-energising stalling security arrangements for the capital Tripoli and establishing a process for Haftar and military leaders in Libya’s west to discuss military unification.“France sees Haftar as a legitimate figure, but the French plan for elections in 2018 has lost out because it was never realistic. Palermo may end up being about small steps to stability and containing the mess. Migration from Libya to Italy is now low and so the crisis is less urgent for Europe. Perhaps as a result there will be fewer deliverables from Palermo.“Haftar not attending would be a blow for Italy’s diplomacy, given that PM Giuseppe Conte flew personally to Libya to plead with the field marshal. Haftar’s absence would also act as a reminder about how vivid the competition between the Islamists of Misrata and eastern Libya still is. Every time diplomacy is undermined, Libya makes a small step towards irreversible partition.”Nancy Porsia, a Libyan field researcher, claimed the Italian deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, had worsened the situation by asking Libya to cooperate with his anti-refugee policies. “The Palermo conference on Libya seems too vague,” she said. “It’s hard to imagine the new government in Rome having the authority or capacity to win a leading role in Libya over France.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2ed59374d36b16dfff26535a3d480045e30299/0_99_3904_2343/master/3904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c06d5075d0432c64e403eec0b6f8a1de","title":"ten student activists detained in china for supporting workers rights","story":"Protesters describe themselves as fervent Marxists and Maoists, presenting a unique problem for Communist partyAt least 10 young Chinese labour protesters have been detained as part of a crackdown targeting a rise in student activism at elite universities across the country.Groups of unknown men detained activists in at least five Chinese cities over the weekend, according one labour rights group, and some were beaten before being bundled into waiting cars.One activist, Zhang Shengye, was “kidnapped” on the campus of Peking University, one of China’s top universities. It was not immediately clear what had happened to the activists who went missing in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wuhan.“They hit him hard and quickly got Zhang under control,” one witness told AFP, requesting anonymity.The activists have presented a unique problem for China’s ruling Communist party. They describe themselves as fervent Marxists and Maoists, supporting workers’ rights as an extension of their communist ideals. Marxist classes are required for all Chinese university students and president Xi Jinping said Karl Marx was “totally correct” in a speech marking the 200th anniversary of the philosopher’s birth.But amid a rise in student protestors hailing from the country’s top universities, authorities have worked to stifle their message of establishing unions and protecting employee rights. Independent unions in China are banned and all unions must register with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a government-affiliated group that usually sides with factory management.“It’s ironic to see how the students who have been studying and believing in Marxism are rounded up by the Chinese authorities for supporting workers, the fundamental value of Marxism,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “The students are simply exercising their their freedom of expression and showing their solidarity to the workers. They should be immediately released.”In August, 50 student activists went missing after police raided an apartment where they were staying. Students from Renmin University in Beijing and Nanjing University have also disappeared or been held under house arrest. Three workers investigating conditions in a factory making shoes for Ivanka Trump’s brand were separately detained in May.Zhang, the recent graduate who was beaten in Beijing, was leading the search for activists who had been previously detained. A witness said the men that detained Zhang also beat several bystanders and prevented them from taking photos, according to AFP.“Peking University acquiesced to the kidnapping. This is another crime universities have committed against progressive students and the leftwing community,” said the Jasic Workers Solidarity group, which has been working with employees of the machine welding company Jasic Technology.The group said at least two members of a NGO supporting workers in Shenzhen, along with three members of the solidarity group and an unspecified number of other activists were also detained in the crackdown.The treatment of students activists has promoted at least one school, Cornell University, to end an exchange program with Renmin University."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d787a29b0423d3720b98a23b04fd0965bd7285a/0_306_3058_1834/master/3058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6ab39043cbf645b04bb90bcd250bacd","title":"armistice day is marked around the world in pictures","story":"100 years since end of first world war marked by silence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684184.1541167032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no more buck passing or dithering dublin needs a new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIllustration: Fuchsia MacAreeThere’s a classic trope in horror films where the protagonist sets aside the norms of rational behaviour and goes down into an unlit cellar, or gets into a car with an obviously unhinged stranger, while the audience can see the terrible event about to unfold and are willing the victim to retreat.It’s a feeling that will be familiar to any long-time observer of Dublin local authority proceedings. Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3694047.1541972647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin and monaghan bombings airbrushed from school books","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTyler with his mother Wendy Doherty and the text book ‘Making History’. Photograph Nick BradshawThe The single deadliest atrocity in the history of the State – the Dublin and Monaghan bombings – has been “airbrushed” from school books, campaigners say.Justice for the Forgotten, which represents survivors and families of the victims of the May 1974 massacre, also describe a history text book brought out this year by leading Irish publisher Gill as containing a number of inaccuracies.Making History “provides everything you need” for secondary students taking junior cycle history, says Gill. It includes a chapter on the Troubles, which covers the escalation of violence after October 5th, 1968 up to the Belfast Agreement.In a “chronological awareness” timeline, it states Bobby Sands died in 1982, the year after his death the McGurk’s bar bombing in Belfast took place in 1969, two years before it happened and that the Downing Street Declaration was signed in 1981 – 12 years before it was actually agreed in 1993.Margaret Urwin, of Justice for the Forgotten, said it is “absolutely incredible” the book makes no mention of the no-warning, rush-hour bombs in Dublin and Monaghan, which killed 33 people, including a mother who was nine-months pregnant, and injured almost 300.“They don’t include it at all,” she said. “They have literally airbrushed it out of history.”Ms Urwin, who has long campaigned for the truth behind allegations of British state collusion in the co-ordinated attacks claimed by loyalist paramilitaries, said the only reference to more than 100 Troubles-related killings in the Republic was in a tally of deaths.“The next generation are not going to know that anything happened here, because all they see is a figure,” she said. “Surely, there should be some oversight of text books from the Department of Education. I think it is appalling.”Maureen O’Sullivan, Independent TD for Dublin Central and a former history teacher who chairs an unofficial cross-party Dáil committee on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, said she was “very taken aback” by the book.“In my teaching days, I would never have come across something like that, that sort of inaccuracy,” she said.Ms O’Sullivan said the book reads like the Troubles “didn’t really affect the 26 counties” and she described the Dublin and Monaghan bombings as “a glaring omission”.“This was the single biggest atrocity in the history of the Republic,” she said. “This is part of our history and it is not in the history books.”Ms O’Sullivan said there was need for more oversight.Margaret Burns, publishing director at Gill, said: “We will have those inaccuracies checked out and if there are any issues we will have them corrected as soon as practical.”She added: “Making History is written in line with the new junior cycle specification and includes content which fulfils the learning outcomes that will ultimately be examined.“We cannot comment on content that is, or is not, required by the specification, that would be a matter for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).”Asked about the publisher’s process for checking school books for inaccuracies and omissions in the absence of any statutory oversight, Ms Burns said the information was commercially sensitive.Attempts to contact the book’s author Dermot Lucey, described by Gill as “synonymous” with history education in Ireland, were unsuccessful.Minister for Education Joe McHugh said the only requirement of a school textbook is that it covers the curriculum.“Ultimately, the decision on which text, if any, most appropriately covers the curriculum, rests within the school itself,” he said. “Any issues regarding the accuracy of texts should be raised with the school management and the publishers.”The NCCA said there is no body or agency in Ireland charged with vetting textbooks.”“There is an open market in textbook production,” said chief executive John Hammond.“The NCCA briefs educational publishers a couple of times a year on curriculum developments underway at the time usually these meetings focus on new or revised specifications that will be available in the following year or two.“The NCCA advises the Department of Education on curriculum and assessment for early childhood, primary and post-primary schooling. Its statutory brief does not cover either textbook production or vetting.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3694416.1541974076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"president michael d higgins says ideas matter as he is inaugurated for second term","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Michael D Higgins gets a standing ovation at his inauguration at Dublin Castle.

Photograph:  Government poolMaxwellsAt his inauguration for a second term on Sunday evening, President Michael D Higgins said “ideas matter” and “history tells us that anti-intellectualism” is “the weapon of authoritarian and anti-democratic forces in so many parts of our shared, vulnerable planet”.“Our choice must be to actively extend and deepen democracy, to express it in wider forms and in new ways,” he said.He said that not alone was “the very existence of our planet in its bioersity threatened, but we have not yet slowed the pace of that destruction.“We live with ongoing violence against women which must be ended.“We must confront and challenge any excuses offered for the denial of the irreducible rights of women, who make up, let us not forget, a majority of humanity on this planet. It is important that we recognise the rights and culture of indigenous peoples. It is also important that each person is free to express their sexuality, gender or relationship.”He was presented with his seal of office by Chief Justice Frank Clarke after taking the declaration of office at Dublin Castle.At the ceremony, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke of Mr Higgins’s overwhelming mandate and said we are fortunate to have somebody with the “values” and “sensitivity” of Mr Higgins, who “speaks for all parts of society”. He acknowledged the contribution of the President’s wife Sabina. Mr Varadkar also made reference to Mr Higgins’s dogs Brod and Sioda.Also in the audience for the ceremony at St Patrick’s Hall were presidential candidates Peter Casey, Joan Freeman, Liadh Ní Riada and Seán Gallagher Ministers Simon Coveney, Katherine Zappone, Simon Harris, Simon Coveney and Paschal Donohoe former presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, and former taoiseach Bertie Ahern.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris and dignitaries from more than 25 countries were also in attendance.The event started with an inter-faith service of prayer from Christian, Jewish and Islamic representatives, including Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin. This was followed by a reflection on behalf of the Humanist Association of Ireland.In 2011, Mr Higgins had become the first President of Ireland to include humanists in the official inauguration ceremony. The association has described the gesture of inclusion towards those of no religion as “very significant”.Among the musicians who performed at the event was Celine Byrne, who sang a song written by Seán Ó Riada, the father of Sinn Féin presidential candidate Liadh Ní Riada.Traditional Irish music was provided by Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh and the combined bands of the Defence Forces School of Music.The event was delayed by six hours so that Government Ministers could attend events in France commemorating the centenary of the first World War ending.The President’s guests at the inauguration ceremony were described as “children and adults from all walks of life”.As Mr Higgins left the hall for Dublin Castle’s Upper Yard he was greeted by about 70 children from schools across Ireland. He also inspected a guard of honour. The couple then held a reception in the State Apartments in Dublin Castle for a number of invited guests.Mr Higgins’s seven-year term had ended on Saturday, and he ceased to be head of State from midnight on November 10th. The Presidential Commission – made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad – stood in during the interregnum period.Mr Higgins wore a suit by Dublin-based tailor Declan Abrahams for the ceremony, while Sabina Higgins wore a dress and coat by Tipperary-born designer Louise Kennedy. She also wore a Kennedy coat and dress for the 2011 inauguration. At the State Apartments reception she was to wear a pink dress designed by Irish designer Heidi Higgins, a graduate of NCAD.It was originally planned that Mr Higgins would be inaugurated for his second term at midday on November 11th, but he asked that the ceremony be moved to facilitate those who wished to attend Armistice Day commemorations that morning.Earlier on Sunday he attended the Armistice Day centenary commemorations at Dublin’s Glasnevin Cemetery.Mr Higgins won the presidential election against five other candidates on October 26th with 56 per cent of first preference votes.

This was making it difficult for people to plan ahead.“I don’t have time to breathe right at the minute because of the panic, consternation, fear and real impact that crashing out of the EU – or even a negotiated exit – is going to bring, not simply to the new population, the immigrant population, but to people whose everyday life is simply thrown up in the air.“We are daily working with people who are trying to understand when European regulations and laws no longer work for people, and what will the legislation be to protect their everyday position.”Ms McAliskey said the current situation in Northern Ireland reminded her of the civil rights movement of the late 1960s and the 1970s, when activists tried to protect people’s civil rights in a rapidly changing society.“We ended up on a treadmill of reactive responses to the violation of rights, and we couldn’t get our heads lifted to see what was happening in the bigger picture.”The veteran activist spoke to The  on Saturday at a seminar entitled We Shall Overcome, marking 50 years of the civil rights movement. The event was organised by a group of trade unions, including Siptu and Ictu, at Liberty Hall in Dublin.A half-century ago the Tyrone woman held a prominent role in the student-led civil rights association that catalogued discrimination against Catholics in housing and employment, and demanded equal voting for all in local government elections. She was later elected MP for Mid Ulster in 1969 at the age of just 21.Ms McAliskey said she believed few people understood what impact Brexit was already having. “I don’t think anybody who is not working at that coalface has the slightest idea of the chaos we are already in, and how much worse it is going to be.”She was not optimistic that the UK would depart the EU with a negotiated orce deal.“The rational, logical, sane answer is that there has to be some form of agreement – but this is the British government we are dealing with. This is the last delusion of a dead empire in the resurrection, so rationale and logic doesn’t really come into it.”Michael Farrell, another veteran civil rights leader from the Northern Ireland movement of the late 1960s, told the Liberty Hall seminar that Brexit had polarised the North’s population, and “threatens to remove or severely weaken mechanisms for protecting rights and equality”.“Sadly, those are the very mechanisms that can be used to protect or assert rights, like LGBTI rights, gender equality, women’s reproductive rights, workers’ rights, and the rights of migrants and asylum seekers,” said Mr Farrell, who with Ms McAliskey was involved in the People’s Democracy group.“It is around these rights that coalitions can be built across the traditional religious and political isions in Northern Ireland.”Mr Farrell said it was “vital” that the UK government stood by pledges given in December 2017 to avoid a hard border in Ireland and to protect the Belfast Agreement so that there would be “no diminution of the protections of equality and human rights in Northern Ireland”.Without these protections, he warned, Northern Ireland could “slip back into ghettoisation and sectarianism or even some level of violence”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Italian officials have been trying to secure his attendance at today’s conference in  Sicily. Photograph: Philippe WojazerReutersItaly is hosting a two-day Libya conference on Monday and aims to push forward a new UN plan to stabilise the troubled North African country after a initiative to hold elections next month failed.Last week, UN envoy Ghassan Salame officially abandoned a western plan to hold national elections on December 10th as way out of the conflict that has raged in the oil producing nation since the toppling of Muammar Gadafy in 2011.Instead the United Nations, which has been trying to mediate for years, wants to first hold a national conference to reconcile a country ided between hundreds of rival armed groups, tribes, towns and regions.Western powers that helped topple Gadafy then left Libya to its chaos, letting militias and radical Islamist groups grow.But worried about it turning into a source of instability on the shores of Europe, European powers have recently paid Libya more attention, and diplomats hope the two-day meeting in the Sicilian city of Palermo will keep up that interest.France hosted a summit in May during which the main Libyan rivals pledged to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in December.But weeks of fighting between militias in the capital Tripoli, as well as deadlock between rump parliaments in Tripoli and the east, has made that plan unrealistic.Italy hopes the conference will help keep pressure on Libyan players to overcome their isions.The Opec oil producer has two governments, a UN-backed administration in the capital and a largely powerless eastern version aligned with influential veteran commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control much of the east.Italian officials were scrambling at the weekend to secure Mr Haftar’s presence. If he shows up, it will be his first meeting with the Tripoli-based prime minister Fayez al-Serraj since the Paris summit, analysts said. Also in attendance will be the internationally recognised House of Representatives, as well as the State Council, a rival assembly.Western diplomats also hope the meeting will help overcome differences between Italy and France, which both have extensive oil interests in Libya but have used different approaches to try to resolve the conflict.France has been courting Mr Haftar, who is supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see his forces as a bulwark against Islamists.Italy is the main backer of Mr Serraj and his weak Government of National Accord, and has worked with local groups in Libya to stop Europe-bound migrants from embarking by boat.Refugees and migrants, many of whom were returned to the country by the EU-funded Libyan coast guard when their Italy-bound boats were intercepted, have reported terrible conditions in Tripoli detention centres. In his newspaper interview, Mr Conte denied that there was rivalry with France over Libya, saying Paris and Rome share “the same viewpoint and objectives”.

European Union negotiators have told Britain there must be a breakthrough early this week on the issue of a backstop to guarantee no return to a hard border if a deal is to be agreed by the end of this month.Conservative Brexiteers and pro-Europeans are united in their opposition to Mrs May’s plan to keep the whole of the United Kingdom in a customs arrangement with the EU until a permanent solution to the Border is found. The DUP’s Sammy Wilson said on Sunday that his party will vote against a deal based on the current proposals and Labour ruled out supporting the prime minister’s plan.In a joint article in the Sunday  with leading Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker, Mr Wilson said the current backstop proposal should be abandoned in favour of a standalone treaty on trade facilitation with Ireland.“The EU would have a mechanism within their existing law for ensuring the integrity of the single market under WTO rules or an FTA. The whole UK would leave together, into a situation of self-government.”Jo Johnson’s resignation as transport minister last Friday, when he described the Brexit negotiations as the worst example of British statecraft since the 1956 Suez crisis, has galvanised other Conservatives who want a second referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared to rule out a second vote on Brexit in an interview with Der Spiegel on Saturday but shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday that the party could yet support another referendum.“If we don’t have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a people’s vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there,” she said.Among the issues that remain to be negotiated is the nature of a review mechanism that would determine when a backstop would end. The EU has rejected British proposals for a unilateral review mechanism and for independent arbitration but commons leader Andrea Leadsom said Britain must be able to leave when it chose.“It cannot be a decision that can be overturned by the EU, it must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something the European Union can hold us to,” she told the BBC.“Frankly, it’s because that would be to then fail to fulfil on the will of the people expressed at the referendum and I very much doubt we’d get it through parliament.”Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested on Sunday that Britain could leave the EU without a deal but pay £20 billion to Brussels in return for a standstill transition period up to December 2020.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Celebrating Macron’s pro-Europeanism, Germany’s Handelsblatt wrote, “There is renewed hope for the European project.”The Economist’s cover showed Macron walking on water.Macron stirred anticipation that he would revive the moribund French economy and, from that position of domestic strength, he would bring new vigour to European integration.Instead, just 18 months later, his approval rating has fallen below 30 percent. Polls are beginning to reflect those low personal approval ratings. Even as Macron is making grand plans to lead a new political force into the European Parliament next year, his Achilles heel at home continues to undermine him.Why Italy could be facing a disastrous new recessionIn May, the Macron-led La République En Marche (LREM)Mouvement Democrate (MoDem), with an expected vote share of 27 percent, was 10 points ahead of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) now, the LREMMoDem predicted vote share at 19 percent is behind RN’s 21 percent.Although still lauded abroad, Macron’s domestic fortunes have slid because he has followed dubious “trickle down” policies, which have repeatedly failed to rekindle optimism among citizens who face economic hardship and uncertainty. Hence, somewhat opportunistically, Macron has sought to appease anxious domestic constituencies with narrow nationalistic polices.These have also put paid to any likelihood of promoting a pro-European agenda. Macron would do well to heed the lessons from Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi’s descent into the political abyss.Renzi was also 39 years old when he became prime minister. German chancellor Angela Merkel applauded him as a “matador.” He played to that hype, dressing as a cool rebel in jeans and trademark leather jacket.He bragged that a dynamic Italy would act as “one of Europe’s leaders.”  saw Renzi as the man who would “save Europe’s soul.” But Renzi also adopted failed domestic policy approaches and undermined the coalitions needed to advance his agenda.Common to both of them, and ultimately the source of their undoing, Macron and, even more so, Renzi were dealt difficult hands. They inherited poorly performing economies that bred widespread social and political discontent.French per capita incomes have remained flat since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 the unemployment rate is just under 9 percent and youth unemployment is endemic.For most French citizens, the education system does little to help them climb the economic ladder. In all these respects, the Italian problems run much deeper. There is little evidence that Macron’s policies will promote growth. He uses a worn mantra to make a bold claim for his tax breaks for wealthy French citizens: “If you want to share the cake, the first condition is to have a cake”.Whether tax cuts spur growth is unclear, but they always increase the sense of unfairness. Macron’s labour market “reforms”,\u0026nbspwhich make it easier to fire workers, add precarious jobs with short contracts, ranging from a few months to a few hours. Businesses lose the incentive to invest in their employees, and productivity growth declines. The sense of social injustice and economic vulnerability deepens. And now, his proposed environmentally friendly diesel tax has raised a new storm.The conservative opposition leader, Laurent Wauquiez was quick to tap into domestic angst: “You have to be completely out of touch with reality not to understand that taxing fuel is taxing those French who work”.\u0026nbspNationwide blockades planned for 17 November are supported by 78 percent of French citizens. Stuck with the “president of the rich” label,\u0026nbspMacron’s base of supporters has narrowed to successful educated professionals working and living in metropolitan cities.Brexit is a done deal – but the wounds that led to it have not healedDespite his youth, he struggles to attract French youth. The Macron government’s efforts to inject greater equity into the educational system is the best hope for growth and greater equality. Revamping the educational system is a generational task, however. The task is made harder by the political inability to cut back entrenched entitlements and reallocate government expenditure to education.Hence, the prospect that Macron would be a European saviour was always far-fetched. Despite his much-hyped speeches, Macron has approached European integration with an eye to political gains at home.That has predictably deepened European isions. He has alienated eastern European governments by trying to restrict “posted workers,” typically employees of eastern European service providers. Although the numbers of such workers is trivially small, Macron has made the claim that their somewhat smaller pay package constituted “social dumping”,\u0026nbspand therefore hurt French workers.On the bitterly isive issue of migration, French police board trains arriving from Italy to search for and remove migrants, depositing them back at the Italian border.Search of arriving trains also undermines the Schengen system of passport-free travel across Europe. Macron’s recent sermon against an “ultra-liberal” Europe is another effort to regain domestic political support. His throwaway, “we need a Europe that protects” either is just a slogan or requires fundamentally rethinking Europe’s open borders.Making matters worse, by cynically hectoring Italian leaders for failing to fulfil their humanitarian responsibilities to migrants and by accusing eastern European leaders of promoting their national self-interest, Macron has worsened the hugely difficult problem of sharing migrants among European nations. With diminished domestic stature and few European allies, Macron’s much-touted initiative to strengthen the eurozone’s defences during financial crises has predictably run aground.Although German chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed, in principle, to cooperate with Macron, resurgent German nationalism and opposition from within her conservative caucus severely limit what she can do. Other fiscally hawkish “northern” eurozone countries, notably the Netherlands, and Eastern European nations have opposed any initiative that would require them to finance other European governments. Renzi’s European agenda was limited but legitimate: he wanted to soften the fiscal rules that require austerity during economic recessions and, hence, make recessions worse. However, the hallowed rules remained firmly lodged on their pedestal.Creating a coalition to change Europe is nearly impossible. However, as in Macron’s case, Renzi’s real failure was at home, where he too followed the traditional European recipe of “labour reforms”.\u0026nbspHe lost domestic support rapidly, especially among young Italians. Suffering high rates of unemployment from Italy’s brutal economic downturn, few Italians believed that the increasing number of highly insecure new jobs would be stepping-stones to stable incomes. Renzi’s end came quickly.In a December 2016 referendum to endorse his proposed constitutional reforms, Italian citizens humiliated Renzi, leading to his resignation. Around 80 percent of those between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four voted against him.Macron enjoys important institutional advantages relative to Renzi. As president with a five year term and a solid parliamentary backing, he remains in charge. But the very brashness that led to his dazzling ascent is causing even his most fervent admirers to part ways with him. Most recently, interior minister Gerard Collomb, France’s “top cop,” resigned after a public spat with Macron. The departing Collomb castigated Macron for “hubris” and “lack of humility.”On economic policy, Macron’s well-wishers Jean Pisani-Ferry and Philippe Martin have warned that he needs to deal more directly with inequality and the widespread sense of lack of fairness. Macron needs to change both style and policy priorities. Otherwise, France’s delicate social fabric will fray further, and in the manner of many predecessors since the illustrious Charles de Gaulle, Macron could abruptly lose all political effectiveness.Ominously, Macron’s predecessor, François Hollande was humiliated in the European parliamentary elections in 2014, a setback from which he never recovered. The looming European parliamentary elections in May 2019 – on which Macron has set such great store – could prove his undoing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Hooker made note of the fact that all the reliable surveys show that there is still a demand for bricks and mortar shops.\u0026nbspConsumers\u0026nbspjust use them less than they used to, and they want them to operate differently, alongside and as a complement\u0026nbspto their online excursions.\u0026nbspThat means the future will have to be made up of smaller premises that operate as mini showrooms, alongside “experience”\u0026nbspretailers such as vape shops and ice cream parlours, which have been doing well.

They are also finding it harder to retain the staff they have\u0026nbsp (34 per cent reported difficulties in this areas, up from 27 per cent six months ago).\u0026nbspThe cause of these problems isn’t hard to ine. The number of non UK born workers coming in fell by 58,000 in the 12 months to June 2018. Despite Prime Minister\u0026nbspTheresa May’s empty sloganeering about the creation of a ‘Global Britain’, the foul smell of her hostile environment migration policy persists. The lion’s share of the decline was made up of non EU-born workers, the number of which coming into the UK fell by 40,000 during the period in question.\u0026nbspMinister u-turns after claims firms to check EU citizens\u0027 statusHome Office \u0027risking repeat of Windrush scandal for EU citizens\u0027Government report could end low skilled migration if accepted Hear, hear, a legion of lumpen trolls rumble. Cuz that means higher wages and more opportunities for the natives!Erm, not quite. Let’s look at some more of those inconvenient things called facts that are the stock in trade of the CIPD’s output.\u0026nbspThe report does point to stronger wage growth for some staff, and for new hires. But it is limited and the overall outlook for wage growth remains unchanged for the majority of UK’s workforce. The median (most common) basic pay rise expectation in the 12 months to September 2019 remains stuck at about\u0026nbsp2 per cent, unchanged when compared to three months ago, and below the rate of inflation.Part of the explanation for this may lie in the weak productivity growth that continues to dog the UK. May’s Government has been making a lot of noise about addressing it\u0026nbspbut to little apparent effect. \u0026nbspThe survey data also suggests, however, that Brexit is acting as a brake on basic pay growth for a small but growing proportion of employers. They’re choosing to batten down the hatches and hoard their money as opposed to investing it in their staff, or in anything else for that matter. Given the chaos that will result from the no deal outcome that appears ever more likely, who could blame them?The upshot of all this is that the benefits claimed by advocates of reducing migration - more jobs, higher wages - are not being realised by British workers.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

In the first half of 2018, 2,692 shops closed, while 1,569 opened – leading to a net loss of 1,123. The closures were mainly seen in the areas most affected by online shopping, such as fashion and electricals, while a shift to “in-home leisure” saw pubs taking a hit and 340 stores in the restaurant, catering and entertainment sector disappearing. Why the death of the high street is good for men – and bad for womenPhilip Hammond to announce £1.5bn plan to support high streetDebenhams to close 50 stores putting 4,000 jobs at riskAsos sales soar as online retailer leaves high street rivals behindSome of the UK’s biggest retail brands have been rocked by financial difficulties this year, with many forced to close branches. House of Fraser\u0026nbsprecently\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration after a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) aimed at cutting costs failed to impress creditors. The chain was subsequently bought by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, but he has been unable to save all stores. Meanwhile, Mothercare announced earlier this year that it would close 50 stores under a CVA, and Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it would close 100 shops over the next four years.Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “The continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality of that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.“Openings simply aren’t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. Specifically, the openings across ‘experiential’ chains, such as ice cream parlours, beauty salons and vape shops, haven’t been enough to offset closures in the more traditional categories.”Ms Hooker warned that the turmoil facing the sector is “unlikely to abate”. “Store closures in H2 due to administrations and CVAs already announced will further intensify the situation,” she added. “The British high street is in urgent need of new ways of thinking and new forms of retail. Encouraging this should be a priority. “However, it remains to be seen if recent packages of support for the high street and reductions in business rates for smaller retailers will be sufficient to stimulate this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471.

While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s very much a continuation of the styling OnePlus used on the OnePlus 6 earlier in the year. That was the first to break with the metal-back styling of phones since the OnePlus 3 and opt for a glass enclosure front and rear.\u0026nbspThis looks as smart and stylish as the last model – which is very stylish, by the way –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspalthough it\u0027s a little thicker from front to back (8.2mm instead of the OnePlus 6\u0027s 7.8mm), it feels very comfortable in the hand, not least because it\u0027s narrower than the last model.Still, it squeezes in a bigger 6.4-inch display\u0026nbspbecause the screen proportions are different: This is a 19.5:9 ratio screen. There\u0027s a notch at the top, but it\u0027s pretty minimal, like a drop of water when it\u0027s just about to gain enough critical mass to drip from the bathroom tap, no bigger than that. It looks cute.This teardrop notch is one obvious change. The second comes when you flip the phone over. Unlike on the OnePlus 6, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor just below the dual cameras.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Pick up the phone and the fingerprint icon lights up on the dark screen. Touch it, and it responds with a neat animation, like a fizzing electrical sphere, and unlocks to the home screen. It feels like the future.Huawei has a similar technology, though a less glitzy special effect, on the Huawei Mate 20. Huawei\u0027s feels just that bit quicker, but this is far from slow. It\u0027s not as fast as a conventional fingerprint sensor, but at least there\u0027s the cute animation to entertain you –\u0026nbspand it\u0027s still only a fraction of a second.Also, it sits in just the perfect place, right at the bottom of the display, in the middle, while the Mate 20 Pro sensor is quite a bit higher.That other Chinese brand, Xiaomi, also has an in-screen fingerprint sensor on its new Mi 8 Pro handset, though that requires a little more pressure.Top tip: when you\u0027re enrolling your fingerprint, think about what angle you\u0027ll actually be unlocking it from. My vertical thumb print wasn\u0027t very effective. I registered it again coming at it from the angle that it turns out I would actually pick the phone up by and it worked like a dream.OnePlus has beaten smartphone heavyweights Apple and Samsung to introduce an in-screen fingerprint sensor (OnePlus)Overall, the fingerprint unlock is pretty reliable, though it doesn\u0027t work as consistently as, say, Face ID on the iPhone XS. But it does the job more than nine times out of ten, so enough to keep you coming back to it rather than turning to the other ways to unlock the phone, such as facial recognition (consistent but not as much fun) or tapping in a PIN code.When it unlocks, you get to see the display in all its glory. It covers 86 per cent of the front of the phone. You can even obscure the notch if you want, or at least set it so the display colours itself black on either side of it, so it blends in. But with such a pretty notch, why would you hide it? Well, only because it gives the screen a little more symmetry, near-matching bezels at top and bottom, it suddenly looks like.The 6.41-inch display on this phone is bright and colourful, looking eye-searingly vivid in some wallpapers (which I love the look of, by the way). The wallpapers even bear the OnePlus slogan of Never Settle, a reminder of the plucky Chinese brand\u0027s positive attitude.It\u0027s a pin-sharp OLED screen, with 401 pixels per inch, that\u0027s the same as the iPhone 8 Plus and rather more than the iPhone XR. And it has OnePlus specialities like reading mode which turns the screen monochrome as though it were a Kindle.\u0026nbspIt completely dominates the front of the phone and you\u0027ll be glad to know it\u0027s robust –\u0026nbspit\u0027s made of Gorilla Glass 6.OnePlus mobile phones are seen on display during a press briefing in Mumbai, India, July 31, 2018 (REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas)As far as the rear of the phone is concerned, there are two finishes to choose from, Midnight Black (it means matte black) and Mirror Black (it means, oh, you can work it out). Both are attractive.One of the most interesting things about the design is what\u0027s not there:\u0026nbspThe headphone jack. OnePlus is hardly alone in dropping this connection but nonetheless it\u0027s something that many fans have not been happy about, not least because the company championed the headphone jack one the OnePlus 6. Mind you, it means the phone has a bigger battery than last time, which on balance, is a decent trade-off.OnePlus hasn\u0027t introduced waterproofing here, either, something which is a real boon in technology generally. So, don\u0027t drop it in the bath. And, be warned, this phone can feel slippy in the hand.Something else that\u0027s absent is wireless charging. Now, scores of phones have had this capability and until recently it\u0027s gone largely unused. But the truth is that wireless charging pads are an unsung hero of the tech world, providing a genuine improvement in convenience that, once used, is hard to give up on.Wireless charging is especially good at disguising limited battery life because the simplicity of putting it on a pad feels much less of a commitment than digging out the right cable and plugging it in.So, although the company hasn\u0027t ruled wireless charging out for future phones, it\u0027s a shame it\u0027s not here now. Especially as the rear of the phone is glass, not metal.\u0026nbspStill, OnePlus prides itself on charging the battery fast, and that\u0027s definitely the case with the OnePlus 6T, which quickly goes from empty to enough to get through a day in around half an hour. That\u0027s part of the argument against wireless charging, of course, that it\u0027s not as fast.Battery life is strong with a full charge leaving you with a third of a battery by the end of the day, often more. As mentioned, this battery is bigger than on the OnePlus 6.Performance is good, too, thanks to the fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and plenty of RAM to keep everything speeding along. It has the latest version of Android on board, Android Pie 9.0. OnePlus uses its own Oxygen OS set-up which is accessible and attractive.The camera is a crucial element on every smartphone now and I found the OnePlus 6T camera to be a moderate improvement on the last model. The hardware is the same, but algorithms and software have been enhanced to better photograph faces, text, food and night scenes, OnePlus says.The front camera is high-resolution, 16MP, and has similarly had a software uptick to make selfies sharper.The rear camera hardware is good - a pair of sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution respectively - but sometimes I found the images were low on detail in places. Low light was less of a problem than on many phones but I didn\u0027t feel the camera quite on the level of the best in the market, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and iPhone XS. Then again, those phones cost a lot more.Which is a part of the story for OnePlus. Although the latest phone is not as super-cheap as its handsets were when it first arrived on the scene, the price ticket here, £499, is impressive. Especially since the storage on board is 128GB, where many rivals have 64GB as standard, still.Camera apart, there\u0027s not much you miss out on with this phone (well, wireless charging and a headphone jack but they aren\u0027t dealbreakers) and there are some elements, such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which hardly any other phones can match. Add to that the strong performance, great battery life and fast recharge, and the OnePlus 6T is a deeply appealing choice.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sterling dropped more than 0.3 per cent against the greenback to $1.3021, and fell 0.21 per cent against the euro to €1.1471. Analysts put the dip partly down to the US federal reserve’s indication that it will hike rates in December, which strengthened the dollar. UK economy flatlines in September, official figures showEU heaps pressure on Theresa May ahead of crunch talksThe midterms have only given the US economy a short-term boostThe IFS is right – Philip Hammond took a big gamble with his BudgetHowever, UK economic data also had an impact, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that the economy stagnated in September. While growth for the third quarter on the whole was lifted by 0.6 per cent - the fastest rate since 2016 - economists said this was likely to be a one-off. With “persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters”, according to Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce. Meanwhile, Schroders senior European economist Azad Zangana said the economy is not forecast to pick up in the near term. “We expect UK fourth quarter growth to be very weak as Brexit paralysis truly takes hold,” he said. “Assuming the government can successfully negotiate the withdrawal agreement with Brussels and ratify it in Parliament, then we could see a rebound in growth early next year. “However, a failure to complete a deal which would mean a no-deal or cliff-edge Brexit, is likely to cause a further slowdown in activity, which could be enough to tip the UK into recession.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Eventually we could even use the technology to navigate ourselves, as we\u0027re on a path towards miniaturising\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspto the point it could fit in a smartphone.minitiarisation has already begun that could eventually see one fit in a smartphone (Imperial College London)The device represents the UK\u0027s first commercially viable\u0026nbspquantum accelerometer, which is a far more advanced version of the sorts of accelerometers that currently exist in today\u0027s mobile phones and laptops.The idea of using accelerometers for navigating is not a new one – as they\u0026nbspmeasure\u0026nbsphow quickly the speed of an object is changing in time –\u0026nbspthough until now accelerometers have not been accurate enough to match other technologies like\u0026nbspGPS.The quantum accelerometer relies on the precision and accuracy made possible by measuring properties of super-cool atoms, which means any loss in accuracy is immeasurably small.Dr Joseph Cotter, from the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial, said: “When the atoms are ultra-cold we have to use quantum mechanics to describe how they move, and this allows us to make what we call an atom interferometer.”CenterHandout via REUTERS)Real-world applications for the device could first be seen in the shipping industry, as it offers a solution to some of the issues presented by GPS\u0026nbspnavigation.We need new types of navigation because at the moment the world relies very heavily on the global network of satellites to tell everybody where they are, said Professor Ed Hinds, director of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London.Scientists teleport particle into space in major breakthroughIt\u0027s actually rather easy for that system to be emulated and in fact it\u0027s been estimated that the UK alone stands to lose about a billion pounds a day if the satellite navigation system were denied.GPS\u0026nbspemulation – or signal spoofing – can also put cargo ships at risk to piracy,\u0026nbspDr Malcolm said, with\u0026nbsppirates\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspspoof signals in order to lure high-value cargos to dangerous areas.This is just the start of the journey for quantum navigation, he said. Scientists like Heisenberg and Einstein described these quantum ideas in their theories, but it\u0027s taken until now to actually physically make them a reality.\u0026nbspThe step forward this kind of technology offers\u0026nbspis unbelievable.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

We are not going to accept an outline deal at all costs and we are still working on it.”Ministers are also demanding to see full legal advice on the power to be conceded over ending the backstop, after Ms May indicated only a legal summary would be made available.The continued turmoil burst out into the open when Ms Leadsom told BBC Radio 5 Live: “The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement.”The prime minister has urged her cabinet to abandon hopes of a unilateral power to end the backstop and push for a joint review mechanism with Brussels instead.But pro-Brexit Tories fear the UK will locked indefinitely into the customs union – unable to sign its own trade deals – unless it can end the backstop unilaterally, at some point soon after 2020.Ms Leadsom said: “It must be capable for the United Kingdom to decide to leave that customs arrangement and it cannot be something that the European Union can then hold us to.”And she warned: “It’s because that would be to then fail to fulfil on the will of the people expressed in the referendum and I very much doubt that we would get it through parliament.”Second cabinet minister rejects key part of May\u0027s Brexit planThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumPreparations made for hospital food shortages if no-deal BrexitEU leaders say key Brexit issues still not resolvedThe warning came days after Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, also insisted the power must rest with “the sovereign British government”.Ms Leadsom also rejected the idea of an independent body to review if an alternative solution has been found to avoid checks at the Irish border – something dependent on untested technology.However, she insisted she was not on the verge of resigning, saying: “I’m sticking in the government to make sure that’s where we get to in the end.”Crucially, the EU is believed to have rejected Britain’s proposal of independent arbitration over ending the backstop, insisting the European Court of Justice must make the decision.If the prime minister also makes that concession – after repeatedly ruling out ECJ jurisdiction – she would risk even greater opposition on the Tory benches.Ms Thornberry sought to calm Labour tensions by saying the party could still back a Final Say Brexit referendum, just a day after her leader rubbished the idea.The shadow foreign secretary said “all options remain on the table” if Labour fails to force a general election by voting against the deal, if there is one.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn has angered Labour MPs and supporters by arguing Brexit cannot be stopped – and by going on to reject the growing calls for a fresh public vote.But Ms Thornberry said: “If we don’t have a general election then, yes, of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a people’s vote –\u0026nbspbut there are several stages before we get that.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered. What we can do is recognise the reasons why people voted leave.Amid ongoing confusion over the party\u0027s Brexit stance, Sir Keir\u0026nbsppointed out that Labour\u0027s official policy is to leave all options on the table, including a second referendum.Thornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumHe\u0026nbsptold Sky News: Brexit can be stopped. But the real question is, what are the decisions we\u0027re going to face over the next few weeks and months?Decision one is on the deal decision two is - if the deal goes down - should there be a general election? And decision three is - if there\u0027s no general election - all options must be on the table, including the option of a public vote.That\u0027s the clear position and Jeremy\u0027s signed up to that, I\u0027m signed up to that, and that was the position that was passed at Labour Party conference.Labour\u0027s preferred option is to campaign for a general election but as the Brexit talks enter the chaotic final stages, the party is under pressure to soften its stance towards a new public vote.Delegates at Labour\u0027s conference in September, overwhelmingly backed a motion saying the party must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.Sir Keir\u0026nbspalso received a standing ovation when he told the conference hall that remaining in the EU could be on the ballot paper in a future vote.But tensions remain over the issue, as influential figures such as Unite boss Len McCluskey and shadow chancellor John McDonnell are unenthusiastic about a re-run of the Brexit vote.Mr Corbyn faced a backlash from his own MPs\u0026nbspwhen he stood by the comments and rejected calls for a Final Say referendum on Theresa May\u0027s deal.Sir Keir admitted there were some slightly different voices in Labour ranks but everybody has coalesced around a common position on Brexit.But on this question of options on the table, we had a long, long discussion about it and we did agree all options to remain on the table, including the option of a public vote.Neither Jeremy nor anyone else has altered that position, that is the position of the Labour Party.He added: The Labour Party has a healthy discussion. But did we reach an agreement? Yes we did. Are we sticking to it? Yes we are.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain\u0027s Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier face the Cenotaph during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London.

It is a question of a British political decision.\u0026nbspBrexit timetable in turmoil as May scraps meeting to approve dealDowning Street last week said the cabinet needed more time to come to an agreement despite a long meeting last week. But an emergency session called for today to discuss the deal has been cancelled, suggesting a common UK government position is still some way off.Asked about whether a deal would be struck, French minister Ms Loiseau added: “I have no crystal ball unfortunately. We are determined, we are committed to find a good deal. We know that it is better than a no-deal.”Speaking on his way into the same meeting Germany\u0027s EU affairs minister, Michael Roth warned that “the clock is ticking”.\u0026nbspThe room for maneuver is very much limited and our British friends know exactly where our discussions are,” he said.The ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decisionAustrian EU affairs minister, Gernot Bluemel told waiting press there was “a certain dynamic in the negotiations, but it is too early to say how we are going to proceed on that”.\u0026nbspAustria holds the EU council’s rotating presidency and has been coordinating meetings between member states and the Europe Commission, which is leading on negotiations.\u0026nbspThough member states are regularly updated on progress, they are not present at the coal-face of talks with Britain and rely on the Commission for information.Member states were updated by Commission chief negotiator in Monday’s meeting about the current state of talks, with the prognosis understood to be that there has been no breakthrough.\u0026nbspSpanish prime minister Sanchez calls for second Brexit referendumBrexit \u0027can be stopped\u0027, Labour\u0027s Keir Starmer saysThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumPreparations made for hospital food shortages if no-deal BrexitIn a statement the Council presidency said: “The Commission\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel\u0026nbspBarnier, informed the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspministers of the situation following negotiations with the UK over the last few weeks.\u0026nbsp“Michel\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspexplained that intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet. Some key issues remain under discussion, in particular a solution to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.”Both sides want a deal in November, with the original October deadline having slipped. The EU has repeatedly said December will be too late to ratify the deal before the UK is set to drop out of the bloc on 29\u0026nbspMarch 2019.\u0026nbspDisagreements in negotiations are centred on the issue of Northern Ireland, and how to prevent a hard border from appearing with the Republic after Brexit. Though officials are in a communications “tunnel” and reliable information is hard to come by, the EU appears to have agreed to British demands to keep the whole UK inside a temporary customs union to help prevent a hard border.\u0026nbspLoiseau, France\u0027s EU affairs minister, on the doorstep of the meeting (EbS)This UK demand was borne of an unwillingness to see just Northern Ireland kept inside the trade agreement, an approach the Northern Irish unionists who prop up Theresa May’s government have rejected outright as a breach of sovereignty.But Brexiteers in the British cabinet are worried that such a “temporary” customs union might become permanent if no other solution to the border is found.\u0026nbspThe UK has therefore also asked for some kind of review mechanism or time-limit to assuage the Tory ministers – a demand that is proving difficult to square with the EU’s insistence that the backstop must prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland whatever the circumstances. The UK government also signed up to this commitment in writing in December and March.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

These, too, are controversial in the Cabinet, because some right-wing see Brexit as an opportunity to strip out regulations.\u0026nbspIt is unclear whether the proposed UK-wide backstop would even placate Northern Irish unionists, as it would be unlikely to eliminate all regulatory checks across the Irish sea, notable on animal products. The DUP has said they would not accept such checks and vote against any deal that included them.Even if a deal is struck between negotiators it could be voted down by MPs, with the House of Commons maths currently the matter of intense speculation in both Westminster and Brussels.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?\u0026nbspBen Chu\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followIndy PoliticsFrench lessons? France has a 35-hour working week, implemented in 2000Labour, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been making encouraging noises about the idea of a four-day working week for some months now.\u0026nbspAnd this week things seemed to move on a bit further for the opposition party as it was reported that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has spoken to the cross-bench peer Lord Skidelsky about the possibility of an inquiry into the topic.\u0026nbspBut what’s the argument for such a reform? How could it be implemented? And what would the impact be on the economy?Why would we want to move to a four-day week?Many advocates cite greater work-life balance. Working one fewer day a week would free workers up to look after children, elderly parents or simply to have more leisure time.But Mr McDonnell has talked about the move in terms of productivity – or a worker’s output per hour.He argues that British workers work the longest hours in Europe and yet are among the least productive.Give workers four-day week and more pay, unions sayThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThat’s\u0026nbspborne out by the data we have.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u0026nbspestimates that UK workers put in an average of 1,681 hours a year in 2017. That compared\u0026nbspwith 1,514 in France and 1,356 in Germany.\u0026nbspYet the Office for National Statistics calculates that GDP per worker in the UK is lower than both those countries.Labour’s lesson seems to be that one way to boosting our weak national productivity is actually to give people less time in the workplace to encourage them to work more efficiently while they are there.\u0026nbspWhile this might sound fanciful it’s not totally outlandish. One recent study from New Zealand showed that when workers moved to a four-day week at one firm their per-hour productivity did indeed rise.The argument is that a better work-life balance makes people more motivated, perhaps by reducing productivity-sapping illness and stress.How could it be implemented?This is a key question. For whatever the theoretical merits of a four-day week for productivity, ordering the entire economy to shift immediately to such a radically different working time structure would clearly be massively disruptive.Angela Merkel’s economic success may be more about luck than strategyEmployers would have to reconfigure shift patterns dramatically, in some cases having to hire many more workers. Think in particular of public services like schools and the health services. Think of the retail and transport sectors.\u0026nbspAlso, around 15 per cent of the UK workforce is now self-employed. It’s hard to see how the state could practically compel those 5\u0026nbspmillion self-employed workers to limit their working week to four days.One policy possibility\u0026nbspa Labour inquiry might consider is whether\u0026nbspto offer tax breaks or other kinds of support to firms that offer four-day working to employees, hoping that this could\u0026nbspencourage the practice to spread.What would be the impact on the economy?That would depend to a large degree on those productivity effects.\u0026nbspThe size of the economy is the value of the output of goods and services produced over a certain period. Working fewer hours would, as a first order effect, seem likely to reduce the volume of those goods and services, thus contracting the economy.\u0026nbspBut if we could produce more of that output in a given period that negative impact would be mitigated, perhaps even wiped out altogether.And\u0026nbspeconomies are dynamic too.\u0026nbspIf we could increase our productivity\u0026nbspgrowth rate\u0026nbspthrough a shorter working week the economy could, theoretically, be larger over the long run.\u0026nbspCritics argue that the productivity impacts are unproven, and that France, with its 35-hour week, has higher unemployment and a more rigid labour market than the UK, something that seems to be particularly unfair on young people.Yet it’s also worth noting that in the late 1900s UK workers put in on average more than 2500 hours a year, almost 50 per cent more than today. But our economy is far larger than it was then due to productivity growth.\u0026nbspThe big-picture historical lesson is that it’s certainly not impossible for average living standards to rise even as average hours worked falls.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Construction grew 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspafter deep falls in output during the snowstorms early this year.But services, which make up the bulk of the UK economy, contracted 0.1 per cent during\u0026nbspthe month.In the third quarter, business investment fell 1.2 per cent, the worst three-month performance since early 2016.It was also the third quarter of contraction in a row – marking the worst run since the last recession.Surveys suggest Brexit-related uncertainty is causing firms to freeze spending.\u0026nbspWorst run in a decadeThe Bank of England expects growth in the final quarter to decelerate\u0026nbspto 0.3 per cent.However, there was slightly better news from the ONS on UK trade, with the statistics agency reporting\u0026nbspthe trade deficit fell to £2.9bn in the three months to September, down from £6.1bn.Export values were up 3.8 per cent in the period, outstripping import growth of 1.7 per cent.Net trade is therefore estimated to have provided a 0.8 percentage point boost to overall GDP growth in Q3, after dragging\u0026nbspin the second quarter.Chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsought to accentuate the positive elements in the data, arguing the quarterly growth rate was evidence of the “underlying strength in our economy”. Speaking on a visit to Fuller’s Brewery in London, Mr Hammond said: “We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people’s wages can continue to rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It uses the Snapdragon 845 processor and runs on a customised version of Google\u0027s Android operating system.All are features found on rival high-end phones that can cost more than £700, but Xiaomi is to sell the Mi 8 Pro starting at £499, as part of a strategy it calls honest pricing.Xiaomi opens Mi Stores in UK and USWang Xiang, the firm\u0027s senior vice president, said: Today we witness a new chapter in Xiaomi\u0027s global expansion journey, underpinned by our global ambitions.We are thrilled to make great strides by announcing our arrival in the UK.By bringing a range of our amazing products at honest pricing we want to offer more choices and let everyone in the UK enjoy a connected simple life through our innovative technology.The company will face stiff competition to establish itself in a crowded market, with three new iPhones, two Google Pixel 3 handsets and devices from Samsung, Sony and fellow Chinese firms Huawei and OnePlus being released in recent months.As well as the Pro, Xiaomi will also launch its budget Redmi 6A device for £99, which it claims has a battery that can last for up to 19 days.The Chinese firm is also bringing a range of its other gadgets to the UK, including its Band 3 wearable fitness tracker and an electric scooter.These products will go on sale in a physical Xiaomi Mi store, which will open at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd\u0027s Bush, London, on November 18.Mobiles expert Ru Bhikha said the firm\u0027s arrival in the UK should be taken seriously.Since releasing its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has rapidly gained a strong foothold in the market - so much so that it\u0027s already the fourth largest handset manufacturer in the world, he said.Xiaomi\u0027s highly anticipated arrival in the UK therefore threatens to put a big cat amongst the pigeons - by combining top tier design and performance with relatively modest pricing, it poses a real threat to the market.Looking at Xiaomi\u0027s success so far, it\u0027s hard to see how its winning combination of high-end smartphones with lower-than-expected prices won\u0027t drive similar results over here.Thursday\u0027s launch marks the arrival of a significant new kid on the block, and there is no doubt that in finally coming to the UK, Xiaomi means business.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Under Mr Rees-Mogg\u0026rsquos proposal, the UK would pay \u0026pound20 billion to the EU, in what the chair of the influential European Research Group (ERG) has described as a \u0026ldquogenerous offer to make Britain\u0026rsquos departure from the bloc as \u0026ldquoamicable as possible. Writing for the Mail on Sunday, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoIt is time for the Prime Minister to be true to her mantra that \u0027no deal is better than a bad deal\u0027. \u0026ldquoIt is also time for convinced Brexiteers like me to compromise.                Four top ministers on verge of QUITTING as EU forces May into CRISIS                Tory and DUP Brexiteers THREATEN May over Brexit proposalSo, at this late hour in the negotiations, we would like to make a new, generous offer to break the deadlock, to achieve a \u0027No Deal Plus\u0027.It would cost us money but it would finally dispel the \u0027crash out\u0027 Project Fear nightmare scenarios.The North East Somerset MP added: \u0026ldquoAs the PM stubbornly refuses to accept the comprehensive free-trade deal offered by the EU, colloquially known as Super Canada, the final hope must be that when she said no deal is better than a bad deal, she actually meant it.Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s latest intervention comes after Jo Johnson\u0026rsquos shock resignation as transport minister on Friday plunged Mrs May into further crisis, with speculation high that more ministers could follow Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos brother.Jacob Rees-Mogg has set out his new \u0026ldquono deal plus vision for Brexit (Image: )And the DUP has teamed up with Tory Brexiteers, warning they will vote against Mrs May\u0026rsquos Brexit deal.Steve Baker, deputy chair of the ERG, and DUP\u0027s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson insisted they would oppose a deal that breaks up the UK.Writing in the Sunday , they said: If the Government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then, regrettably, we must vote against the deal.

Mr Ellwood told Sky News: \u0026ldquoIt is the job of the Chief of Defence Staff, indeed the MoD and the Defence Secretary, to consider all scenarios whether how vague or rare they might be or whether they might be something that\u0027s expected, we have to plan for every single scenario. \u0026ldquoSo yes, there are contingency plans being made, there are discussions being held behind the scenes as to what support our armed forces will do.

Irish backstop threatens to destroy Union, warns lawyerThe remarks follow a dire week for Prime Minister Theresa May, who faced yet another Brexit crisis when EU officials rejected her key Brexit proposal that would avoid the UK being trapped in the customs union.She had called for an \u0026ldquoindependent mechanism that could allow the UK to quit a temporary customs arrangement if Brexit talks collapsed.A whitehall source told the Sunday Times, Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan is the governments \u0026ldquolife-support machine adding: \u0026ldquoBy rejecting the proposal, the EU has just turned off the oxygen.

Should parents be worried  Absolutely, say the experts.The National Crime Agency estimates that about , people in the UK pose a threat of some kind to children online — and the number is rising all the time.It adds there has been a  per cent increase in the referrals it has received about people uploading images of child sexual abuse since .Just as alarming is the damaging effect that smartphones and social media have on children’s mental health.According to Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, the number of US teens who took their own lives increased by  per cent between  and .And , like me, you have a teenage daughter there is even more reason to be worried.Compared to the early s, nearly twice as many American teenage girls now end their own lives. In the UK, a quarter of -year-old girls experienced signs of depression, according to a study of , young people.Overall, Professor Twenge found that the generation she calls “iGen” — those born after  — are much more likely  to suffer from mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.“What happened that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt ­suicide and commit suicide ” she asks. “The sudden rise of the smartphone.”If you’re not convinced by the advice of the experts, just look at the behaviour of the people who’ve made their fortunes from peddling this digital crack cocaine.Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stopped his children from owning a phone until they were  and the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, would not let his kids play on iPads — even though he invented them.Apple recently introduced a new update that tells you how much time you are spending on your screen each day.That’s a step in the right direction, but don’t expect the company to do too much more. Last year, Apple sold nearly a quarter of a billion iPhones, helping to make it the world’s most valuable brand.The leaders of the tech giants are enriching themselves beyond their ­wildest dreams — not just at our expense but at the expense of our children.So it’s pretty clear they won’t be doing anything to help.

But it will be flawed –– and Mrs May should say so.I admit this sounds odd: Why would a Prime Minister admit that a deal they have negotiated isn’t great ButMrs May tries to say that this agreement is perfect, and that there is no risk of any part of the UK getting stuck in the backstop — which would leave it in an EU customs union but with no say over the trade deals the EU is doing — then she will easily be disproved.Mrs May should take a leaf out of the book of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who as a hugely successful trial lawyer knows a fair bit about persuading people of his case.He told Cabinet on Tuesday that when it came to quitting the backstop “a unilateral right would give the UK greater scope to establish its case, as the other side would have to prove the contrary”.But he went on to acknowledge that negotiating a unilateral right to get out of the backstop was highly unlikely in the time available and a mutual review mechanism could be made to work.Cox’s essential argument is about managing risk. Every option on Brexit now carries with it risk.The challenge is to work out how to best manage these risks. The risk with accepting a legally binding backstop in the withdrawal agreement is that the UK ends up being unable to get out of it cleanly.It would be direthe UK ended up leaving the EU in a way that tied it to the EU for ever.But set against this must be the risk of no deal, and the disruption that would cause. To make matters worse, the Government has done absurdly little to mitigate no deal.The reason that even Cabinet ministers who loathe where the negotiations are heading do not want to go for no deal is they know how unprepared the country is for it.At the same time, there is a risk thatthere is no deal, Parliament would either insist on a second referendum — that would harden isions and toxy our politics — or cancel the process altogether, creating a dangerous democratic deficit.Frankly, the argument that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement is less bad than the alternatives will be pretty much the only thing going for it.It will be hard for her to make this argument as so many of the deal’s problems are self-inflicted.She triggered Article  without knowing what the UK wanted she has wasted much of the past  months in a negotiation with her own Cabinet the failure to plan properly for no deal has weakened the Government’s negotiating position.Even the Parliamentary arithmetic has been made worse by Mrs May. If she hadn’t called that election, there would be a Tory majority and she wouldn’t be so reliant on the DUP.But it is the argument that her deal is less bad than the alternatives that is keeping the Cabinet on board and it is her best — and, possibly, only — way of getting the House of Commons to vote for such a flawed agreement.THE bad news for Theresa May is that it doesn’t get any easier once she’s got a deal with Brussels.For she will still have to get this withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.With the DUP unhappy and  Tory Brexit ultras expected to vote against the deal, as well as Jo Johnson and other Tories who want another referendum, it will be extremely tough to get it over the line.“I can’t quite see where the majority comes from,” admits one Cabinet minister.But there is growing talk that the way to get the deal through might be to bring it back a second time, with the markets – which expect a deal – freaking out.As this Secretary of State says: “Do you get it through the first time  Maybe not.He did little to hide his irritation at being moved from his job as universities minister because of his opposition to Mrs May’s plan to tinker with tuition fees.But his resignation is a blow to the PM – and not just because of his attack on her for “a failure of British statecraft not seen since the Suez crisis”.His departure will put more pressure on those ministerial colleagues who privately share his view that a second referendum is needed, to go.With both Johnsons voting against the withdrawal agreement, it will become even harder to get it through the Commons.SO will any of the Cabinet resign over Theresa May’s Brexit plan  At the moment, ministers believe not.One of those who spoke against the May approach at Cabinet tells me the mood of the meeting was “resigned rather than resigning”.Another predicts critics of what Mrs May is doing “will make their point, then retreat”.This is not to say people are happy. Penny Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, warned that voters wanted a “definitive end point to Brexit” andthey didn’t get it, that risked “feeding a narrative of betrayal, fuelling Ukip”.In private, ministers rail against Mrs May and the way she is handling the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been heard to complain that the UK is making it far too obvious it is in a desperate hurry to get a deal.It is certainly true that by advertising its need for a quick agreement, the UK is almost inviting the EU to ask for more.Tellingly, there is renewed – and increasing – talk among ministers of having a new leader in place to do the next set of negotiations.There is little love for the backstop. And interestingly, Chancellor Philip Hammond argued in Cabinet this week it would be better to extend the transition than trigger the backstop.He argued that the backstop could do damage to supply chains and said “it could be better to extend the implementation period than have a bad backstop”.A problem with extending the implementation period is that it would mean free movement would continue – and the UK would still be sending huge amounts of money to Brussels every year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what a mother.They say no one is irreplaceable but I think she is — which must be such a lot of pressure for him. In short, he has spent his entire le waiting for his mum to die before he can start his dream job.And in the meantime his le, in some ways, is on hold. He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and was instead forced into a loveless marriage.And every time he so much as expresses an opinion about anything, he is denounced as being “meddling”.So it’s no wonder that in Prince, Son And Heir, the BBC documentary this week marking his th birthday, Charles was quick to quell concerns that he would be a “meddling” or activist king, saying: “I’m not that stupid.”Declaring the role of sovereign and heir to be dferent, he said he is aware of the constraints he will encounter as king, and says his behaviour will change.I can see why he is saying that, given the amount of criticism that has come his way over the years. But when you think that he was campaigning about issues such as the environment and single-use plastic long before anyone  got on the bandwagon, it might be better to see him as a trailblazer than a meddler.I admire that he has a voice.And when he is king I think he should use it — not be silenced by the pressure of the role.He has a very broad range of knowledge and he is absolutely passionate. We live in a society where everyone has their say — so why shouldn’t he In fact, I thinkhe visited Europe he might help with Brexit.There is no doubt the Queen is a hard act to follow — when the time comes, that is. Now Charles is  he is the longest serving heir to the throne in history. And he may have years to go, as the Queen looks and sounds fantastic .But we should stop maligning Charles and start supporting him.He is a good man and there is no doubt he is dedicated to the job. He is mature enough to know how to do the job well and he certainly knows what is expected of him.He has brought up two fantastic sons that any parent would be proud of.And he really is passionate about changing the world for the better.It has been more than  years since he set up his Prince’s Trust charity.Last year alone it helped nearly , young people get into education, training and jobs. It is simply fantastic.He is deeply committed to his fantastic we, who is very down-to-earth and great fun .He is also passionate about promoting women’s issues, so whatever you think of him you must give him credit for that.I believe very strongly in the monarchy. I would do anything the Queen asked me to do.The Royal Family are a great thing for our country and something to be very proud of.In a world of increasing uncertainty, they are this country’s rock and foundation. We should all get behind Charles and celebrate him as our future king.Apart from anything , we need all the stability we can get. ANYONE living in London will be unsurprised to hear that there are now a record number of people sleeping rough there.Figures show there were , rough sleepers in the capital between July and September – the first time the total has exceeded , in a three-month period.It’s awful and it’s shocking to see people sitting in the cold begging for money.And it’s hard to know how to help. Of course, the temptation is to give money but obviously that’s just a short-term fix.Night shelters are a good short-term solution. Buthomeless people don’t get involved with a network that can really help them, it’s unlikely their circumstances will ever change.My husband Paul volunteers with the fantastic charity West London Mission . It offers homeless people a hot shower, new clothes, a meal and a decent night’s sleep.But it also offers access to project workers who will help people change their circumstances.Its aim is to empower and help homeless people become part of a community, because that’s the start of them getting off the streets, into accommodation, then into work.There are so many reasons that people become homeless. Some have lost their job and can’t afford rent, or they’ve fallen out with family and turn to drink and drugs.They might have mental or physical health problems, a history of abuse or a dficult childhood moving between foster homes.But where there is le, there is hope. Paul has been working with one guy who was homeless and hopelessly addicted to drugs.But, over time, he has got clean, found a place to live and, last week, got a job at a restaurant, which is what he was doing before he got involved in drugs.He’s got his le back, basically. It does happen.Soyou are worried about homelessness, think about donating to an organisation such as WLM. Better yet, volunteer your time and skills.Even just helping someone to fill out a form, which can be incredibly dficult for some people, can make a huge dference and is so rewarding.TODAY is Remembrance Day and I wear my poppy with pride. This year I will particularly recognise all the true heroes from World War One. I thank them for their service, and remember we are always in their debt.It is so important we never forget the sacrice they made and the bravery they showed.I doubt there will ever be another generation like them. AS a rule, I like to live and let live. But I really had to roll my eyes at the story of -year-old Dutch pensioner Emile Ratelband, “who identies as a -year-old” and is fighting to legally change his age by  years so he can get more work and attract more women on Tinder.Emile, above, was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , .His argument is thattransgender people are allowed to change sex, he should be allowed to change his date of birth because doctors said he has the body of a -year-old.So does that meanI feel like a supermodel inside, I can I get my job title legally amended Or maybe at  I could identy as  so I can have access to my pension SO the six men arrested for burning an effigy of Grenfell Tower are in hiding and relying on friends and relatives to bring in food and drink.

Once a near-bankrupt, he is now worth an estimated poundmillion. Rich and privileged, a shamed Tory politician jailed for lying to a judge about paying a prostitute for sex, he is even beginning to feel guilty about his good fortune. The dizzying many lives of the boy from Weston-super-Mare include a magnicent penthouse on the south bank of the Thames, giving the controversial peer unrivalled views of a Parliament bankruptcy forced him to vacate as an MP before ing unelected.  The luxurious apartment is an art gallery in the sky, with Archer advising visitors seeking the bathroom during his Krug and shepherd’s pie parties to walk past the Monet then left at the Picasso. “No, no, no, no – I have never said it, have I Alison ”, he shrieks playfully to a devoted assistant. “No, he never has,” she replies in this little pantomime. All three of us know, of course, Archer does. Regularly. “It’s a tease,” he laughs defensively. “And I was told that under no circumstances was I to say that to you so you would take it seriously.”  The paintings are expensive signposts to a loo where another prized piece, a Hockney self-portrait, hangs over the toilet. The ex-Conservative vice-chair and potential Tory candidate for Mayor of London until jail and disgrace, rarely attends the Lords and is toying with retiring from it when he reaches  in two years. But he remains interested in politics. During our chat he breaks off to take a call within my hearing from Nadhim Zahawi, an education minister, with Archer passing on an uncannily accurate prediction gleaned from lunch with a Canadian former foreign secretary that Donald Trump would tighten his grip on the US Senate.  Despondent about his own warring party’s prospects, Archer frets Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would heavily tax multi-millionaires like himself. Worrying the ided Tories will beat themselves to gt the Islington revolutionary a backdoor key to No, Archer growls: “I don’t think Corbyn can win but I do think the Conservatives can lose. “It would be terrible. I can think of half a dozen leaders of the Labour Party I would welcome after a -year period and he is not one of them. “John McDonnell is not one of them.”  David Miliband, a Labour red prince over the water in the US, is one. Backbench MPs Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper are others. Labour is proposing to tax annual income above pound, at just p, yet at a higher rate the book machine concedes he would keep writing. Nor is he threatening to flee a Britain led by a Prime Minister Corbyn. “I want to live in this country. I love this country,” he emphasises.  “I want to see Somerset play cricket. I wish they’d win occasionally. I want to see Bristol Rovers play football. I wish they’d win occasionally. “I want to see the theatre twice a week. I want to go to art galleries twice a week, please. “You only get one le and those of my friends who’ve shot off to strange places,” he says before pausing momentarily, restarting with condemnation. “John Cleese, who I don’t know, I couldn’t believe it when he said he was going to Nevis. I had to look it up on the map. It’s got , people.” Nevis is a Caribbean tax haven, and the furthest Archer is likely to go is his palatial holiday villa on Majorca.  The storyteller’s latest novel is a thriller, Heads You Win, charting the fate of a teenager who escapes Russia after the KGB assassinates his trade union activist father. Effectively banned in Putin’s Russia where no company is willing to risk publishing the book, Archer acknowledges the Salisbury poisonings have pricked interest. Story telling caused Archer problems in his political le, with accusations he gilded achievements, including education, to give himself a leg up from a middle class background in Somerset before striking gold with the likes of Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less. Snooty literary critics resent his popularity – he has sold more than  million books – and a friend of the author claims Archer was a victim of snobbery much of his le. Was he aware of it  “Oh very conscious of it,” replies Archer.  In the Lords, he adds, grand landed peers inheriting seats and country homes stretching back into the mist of time split between those who treated him as an equal and those who look down their noses. He says: “Snobbery in this country lasted a long time. “I love watching black and white movies when you see, not only are they better stories than you get now, but the snobbery is unbelievable. “If you go right back to Pride and Prejudice... there was an aristocracy, upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, lower class and working class.  “And you knew which you belonged to and you could only fight to get to the one above. You couldn’t get right to the top.” Archer’s we Mary is a constant presence in his conversation despite not being present when I visited the penthouse. She had left earlier for London’s Science Museum which she chairs. Archer clearly adores the woman who stood by him after his public disgrace.  “She’s absolutely wonderful,” he says. “And I know how fortunate I am.” The once brash Tory thruster who survived cancer admits he has mellowed with age. “Yes. Everybody thinks so. It’s very sad,” he laughs.  “I had an Indian come in the other day... I said ‘listen, you worm’, and he said ‘oh my god, Jeffrey. “I remember the days when you called me a pathetic worm. What’s wrong, Jeffrey ’.” The pivotal moment was that  jailing for perjury which led to him campaigning for penal reform as well as producing, in typical Archer style, three bestselling volumes of prison diaries.  “I certainly realised how privileged I was, how lucky I was,” he says. “There was one kid sitting on the end of the bed when I was leaving on the Monday and he said ‘I’d change places with you’. I said ‘wait a minute, I’m  years old. You’re . You’ve got a deal’. He said ‘No, no, I’m a heroin addict’ and he died two years later. “I see him on the bottom of the bed regularly.”  Archer is vowing to continue writing as long as readers buy his books. “Frightened to stop,” he says. “If the stories dried up I might say ‘I’m , what the hell  I’m going to live in Majorca and you can all jump in a lake’. “But as long as the stories are coming I’m going to go on and on and on.  “If you had a boring job putting wheels on cars for Volkswagen you might feel ‘at  I’m very happy to do something ’. “But I’ve got a very exciting job which I still enjoy.”Heads You Win by Jeffrey Archer is published by Pan Macmillan, pound."},{"url":null,"title":"spanish pm demands second brexit","story":"NewsSpanish PM demands second Brexit referendum so UK can come back in to EUPrime Minister Pedro Sánchez has added his voice to calls for a Peoples Vote - but he admits there isnt time to hold it before March ShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  NOV NewsSpains Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for a second vote - but it may be too late to actually stop Brexit \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSpains Prime Minister has called for Britain to hold a second Brexit referendum. Pedro Saacutenchez made the dramatic intervention just days before Theresa May hopes to reach agreement on Britains plan to quit. Mrs May has insisted there will be no second referendum despite , people marching through London for a Peoples Vote. And Labour is split over whether it is right, or even possible, to hold a referendum before exit day on  March . Today Mr Saacutenchez added his voice to the growing calls for a second referendum. But he did so with a very important catch.  Instead of calling for a second referendum before Brexit, he said there should be a vote after  March, to come back in. It comes after warnings there would not be enough time to hold a second referendum before  March. Mr Saacutenchez admitted there was a lack of time, saying we’re now on the verge of signing a transition deal. However, he told Politico: I’d like to see the British government calling a second referendum.I don’t mean now, but in the future, so that it can come back to the EU.In another way, but back into the EU.  Mr Saacutenchez warned Britain has taken a path of self-absorption which would be a great loss for both sides. He thanked Mrs May for safeguarding the rights of Spanish citizens in the UK - and promised tothe favour. But he said bluntly: If I was Theresa May, I would call a second referendum - no doubt. Some Tory backbench MPs have been calling for a second vote, and Labour has been hit by an internal battle over whether it can stop Brexit. October : No Deal preparations have to begin no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time. November : The UK was hoping for a final Brexit summit to seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. However, this looked off the cards as talks stalled over the Northern Irish border. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to get a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in.

Talks between top officials ran to .am this morning in Brussels - and the Prime Minister will summon her Cabinet tomorrow to discuss new plans. Mays Mays official spokesman declared today: There remain signicant issues to resolve. We want to make progress as soon as possible. No Deal Brexit plans costing billions of pounds have to start being enacted within days, otherwise they wont be ready by exit day on March . Yet talks are still deadlocked over a backstop - backup plan - to extend EU customs rules across the UKtheres no deal to keep the Irish border open.  Multiple reports today suggested Mrs May is trying to get a deal agreed on her own side within  hours.Otherwise there will not be enough time to arrange a special November summit with the other  EU leaders. A government source told Sky News: Realistically at some stage on Wednesday is as late as it can go. Evenshe does get a deal through the Cabinet and the EU, Mrs May is being warned it wont pass the third hurdle - the UK Parliament. MPs will be given a vote on the deal and Labour, the DUP, Tory Remainers and Tory Brexiteers have united against it. October : No Deal preparations have to begin no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time. November : The UK was hoping for a final Brexit summit to seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. However, this looked off the cards as talks stalled over the Northern Irish border. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to get a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will likely face a Tory leadership challengeshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. John Whittingdale, the former Culture Secretary, warned Theresa May will have to quitthe deal fails at that stage. I thinkthe Prime Ministers Brexit plan doesnt get through Parliament I think its quite dficult to see how the Prime Minister can continue because she has staked her credibility, the Tory MP told the BBCs Westminster Hour. Its very hard for her to turn round and say ‘OK, well my plan’s been torn up by Parliament, Ill go away and think of another one.’” Talks are stuck over the backstop to continue EU customs rules in the UK. Brexiteers say this would leave the UK shackled to Brussels with no power or say in its affairs.  Mrs May first wanted to set an end date on the backstop - but the EU said that wasnt acceptable. Then she wanted a mechanism letting the UK quit no matter what - but EU sources rejected that too. A worried UK official told the Financial Times: “They are pushing and pushing on everything. Ministers from the other  EU nations were being briefed on developments this morning by chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Arriving for the mini-summit in Brussels, French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said: The ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decision. Ms Loiseau added: I have no crystal ball unfortunately. We are determined, we are committed to find a good deal. We know that it is better than a no-deal. She made clear that a temporary customs union giving the UK unilateral powers to bring arrangements to an end was not acceptable.  If you have any sort of temporary arrangement, this needs to be a bilateral decision from the EU and the UK at the same time, and we have to know at that moment what sort of solution there is for the Irish border, she said. Germanys Europe minister Michael Roth said: A customs union is an option but we must be careful that it doesnt lead to unfair relations between the EU and the UK, particularly in environmental, workplace and social standards. It must be a genuine backstop. Belgian foreign minister Didier Reynders said: For this moment its dficult to make real progress, but before Christmas Im hoping it will be possible. Askeda special Brexit summit could be staged in November, Mr Reynders said: We are ready to do that but to organise a summit you need to have some progress. If we are in the same situation as  days ago it is a nonsense to organise it this month. It will be maybe the case in December. We have seen some movement but it seems to be not enough.

Among these were members of the royal family who solemnly watched Remembrance Day commemorations in London from a balcony overlooking the Cenotaph war memorial. In attendance were the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex. However royal fans noticed something rather bizarre about the positions in which the family members stood.  The Queen, Kate Middleton and Camilla all stood together on one balcony to watch the proceedings, while Meghan Markle stood on another balcony at a dferent window. Meghan, , wasnt alone though, she was joined by Elke Buumledenbender, the we of German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. One interpretation of this balcony situation is that Meghan had been asked to look after the Presidents we - a sign that the Queen has faith in her to handle diplomatic situations. However many people think this wasnt the case and claim the expectant mother was snubbed by the Queen.  Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, told PEOPLE he believes it was all to do with a royal pecking order and its something that was also obvious during Meghans Trooping the Colour debut in June - when she stood behind Prince William and Kate. He explained: She was not as prominent perhaps as some people might have expected, but theres a pecking order. There was no slight intended, but William being the older, more senior brother would go out [first] with his we.  Meghan was still in a good position, she was central rather than the alternative of being in the front row and along the balcony to the left or right. A palace source added that Meghans balcony position would have come from her. They added: Theres no one laying this out, telling her where to stand. And there were a lot of kids who everyone would want at the front.

Nightmare neighbours Donna Simons and Leigh Dixon have been forced out of the home after accepting a closure order sought by council chiefs. The pair did not contest the three-month closure order which was sought by Plymouth City Council at a short hearing at Plymouth Magistrates Court on Tuesday.  Plymouth City Councils legal representative presented a thick file of evidence which included reports of a sustained period of drug-related activity at the property. The material was backed up by police reports, witness statements and scene photographs of the items officers found. In addition, the magistrates heard this was not the first time the pair had been subject of a closure order.  The councils legal representative noted how Simons and Dixon had been ordered out of another flat earlier this year following similar complaints and evidence. John Haythorne, mitigating for Simons, and in response to the councils application for court costs, said his client was now homeless and was reliant on benefits. He added: She is, to put it simply, a drug addict. We dont know where she is going to be or her means. She is also in the worst possible health.  Magistrates agreed the council could attempt to recover pound, court costs from the pair. A spokesman for the council said: The order was granted under section  of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act . Tenants Donna May Simons and Leigh Neville Dixon did not contest the hearing. The closure follows a signicant increase in the amount of violence and disorder surrounding the address linked to the tenants and others who reside or frequent the address.  Councillor Sally Haydon, cabinet member for customer focus and community safety, said: “Anti-social behaviour is not tolerated in Plymouth.That message is clear. If you make innocent, law-abiding residents lives a misery, then we will act, and we will put a stop to it.

Yellow weather warnings were issues as Remembrance Sunday showers hit yesterday after south Wales suffered floods on Saturday for the second time in three weeks. It is expected to be a damp day across western parts of the UK today with heavy showers and thunder forecast. There will be showers across southern parts of England too. However, it will be a drier day further east with spells of sunshine.  Showers will continue across western and southern parts of the UK into tonight, but these will begin to ease for southern areas towards the end of the night. It will be drier further east with a few clear spells, but there is the risk for a few showers spreading into north-east England by dawn.  But, the UK is set for its warmest mid-November days for  years with highs of up to C from Wednesday starting a week-long warm and mainly dry spell with sunny periods for all. Wednesday could be the warmest November  since records began in highs beat the .c recorded in Cwmbargoed, Glamorgan, Wales.  The high temperatures are caused by El Nino - the warming of eastern Pacic sea-surface temperatures - but this could also bring late winter freezes, as it did in  . But the high temperatures wont last long as the weather it set to go form mild to wild later in the month. The Met Office said a bitter last week of November could bring snow to the north of the country.  Freezing conditions are also expected after Christmas with -c temperatures, snow, ice and travel chaos forecast in January by The Weather Outlook. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Glaze said: “Britain’s weather looks like going from mild to wild. “Indian Summer conditions in coming days see C sunny spells challenging date records. “But it is set to turn much colder ahead, and after Christmas is forecast spells of snow, ice and travel disruption, with lows down to -C in parts of Scotland and -C in England.” Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “Remembrance Sunday had a high chance of showers, with Monday also showery. “But high pressure builds with dry and fine conditions for many southern and eastern areas on Wednesday, spreading to the North as well from Thursday until the weekend, with very mild temperatures and highs around C. “Settled weather continues until November , although there could be low cloud and fog at times. “But the big change ahead is to a colder last week of the month, moving from above to below-average temperatures with the risk of wintry conditions in the North.” The Met Office three-month forecast said that El Nino implies an increase in the likelihood of milder-than-average conditions for the UK.

The most recent occurred in a country music bar in Thousand Oaks, Calornia on November  when a gunman named Ian Long shot and killed  people. Since then thousands have spoken out about the need for the United States to crack down on gun control - including hospital staff who see first hand the horrors of gun violence each day.  However the National Rle Associationbelieve that doctors shouldnt get involved in matters of gun control and in a recent tweet advised that they stay in their lane. They said: Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves.  Many people were outraged and slammed the NRA for their insulting post. One such inidual who hit back at the organisation was Dr Kristen Gee from Los Angeles. On November  she decided enough was enough and took to Twitter to highlight the horric reality of gun violence. The medical professional shared a gruesome photo of her hospital scrubs drenched in the blood of a gunshot victim. Alongside the photo she wrote: To theNRA, this is what it looks like to stay inmy lane. We will not be silent about the toll ofgun violence.

And Dr Gee wasnt the only one offended by the NRAs post. Do you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly  This isnt just my lane. Its my f***ing highway, replied forensic pathologist Dr Judy Melinek. Dr Ellie Curtis also shared a shocking x-ray image of a -year-old patient shot by an R.I.P. bullet, which had shattered in his chest.  She asked the NRA: How many of those fragments could you find and fix  Another distressing image came from retired nurse Marianne Hardman, who tweeted a picture of the aftermath of gun violence in a hospital room saying that putting doctors through this terror is despicable. In the picture the hospital bed and floor is covered in blood, tools are strewn everywhere - its complete chaos.  The NRAs tweet came as a response to an article by ACPtitled Reducing Firearm Injuries and Deaths in the United States. In the article ACP recommend ways for doctors and lawmakers to help combat gun violence, including training doctors in firearms injury prevention and counseling patients on the risk of having firearms in the home.

Mr Putin gave Mr Trump a thumbs up before they shook hands and sat down to listen to Mr Macron’s -minute speech in the ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. And he appeared to be aiming his remarks at the US President, who frequently talks of “America First” policies.  Mr Macron said: shy“Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. “By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it le, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values. “I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface.  “They are ready to wreak chaos and death. History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again. “Let us build our hopes rather than playing our fears against each other. “Ruining this hope with a fascination for withdrawal, violence or domination would be a mistake for which future generations would rightly find us responsible.  “May this gathering not be just one day. This fraternity, my friends, invites us, indeed, to lead together the only combat that is worthwhile: the fight for peace, the fight of a better world. “During these four years, Europe failed to commit suicide. Mankind had sunk into the hideous labyrinth of merciless clashes, into a hell that engulfs all fighters of whatever side, of whatever nationality they were.” Thousands of ordinary French people had also turned out, despite persistent heavy rain.  Several wore bright red poppies as a mark of respect to the British and Commonwealth troops who paid the ultimate price in the conflict – which claimed around . million soldiers and  million civilians. Just before the leaders assembled, a topless female protester with the words “fake peacemaker” scrawled across her chest came within a few metres of Mr Trump’s motorcade before security swooped and grabbed her. Mr Macron and fellow dignitaries had marched to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Arc de Triomphe beneath black umbrellas while church bells tolled throughout the French capital. The service ended with the same bugle call that was played at am on November ,  to signal the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front.  Mr Trump, who was accompanied by First Lady Melania, later went to the cemetery of Suresnes, in the suburbs of the city, where hundreds of American soldiers are buried. The President had earlier sparked shywidespread criticism for pulling out a similar visit, blaming it on the rain. Meanwhile, there were ceremonies taking place all over the world, emphasising the number of countries that had been affected by the Great War. In Australia, thousands gathered at the official national service at the Australian War Memorial in capital Canberra, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison led a minute’s silence.  In Sydney, crowds gathered at the Anzac Memorial, which the Duke of Sussex unveiled an extension to during his recent royal tour. And there was also a service at the Shrine of shyRemembrance in Melbourne. Some , Australians served overseas during the First World War, the vast majority of them on the Western Front alongside British soldiers and their allies. More than , died – over two-thirds of them on the battlefields of Europe.  Large crowds also attended the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington for New Zealand’s main remembrance ceremony. Nearly , New Zealanders served in units overseas, with around a fth of them never ing home. And commemorations were held all over Russia, which had a population of around  million when the conflict broke out and had suffered . million losses by the time it was over.

During the flight in , the plane flew through a raging thunderstorm before noseing towards the ground after being struck by lightning. Carrying  people, the aircraft began to break apart in mid-air as a fire took hold of one of its engines causing a wing to fall off. Juliane, who had been travelling with her mum Maria, recalled: After about  minutes, I saw a very bright light on the outer engine on the left.  “My mother said very calmly: ‘That is the end, it’s all over’. Those were the last words I ever heard from her.. Speaking out about the tragedy decades on, Juliane, a biologist, went on to describe how minutes later, she heard complete silence. She realised she was free falling to the ground while still attached to her plane seat, news.au reports. She said her mother and another passenger sat next to her had been sucked from the plane. She added: I saw the forest beneath me — like ‘green caullower, like broccoli’, is how I described it later on.” Juliane fell an astonishing  metres during the incident on Christmas Eve that year. She landed on the floor of the Amazon jungle, where she woke up on Christmas Day after blacking out. She told VICE: “I had a serious concussion, so I couldn’t sit up. My eye was swolle. I was lying underneath my seat and I wasn’t strapped in anymore. “I could see a bit of the forest but also a bit of the sky. I knew that I had survived a plane crash. The concussion and the shock only let me realise basic facts. Struggling to find the strength to move, Juliane lay on the jungle floor for around  hours before attempting to seek help.

Liam McGuigan, from Queensland, was on a school football trip when a mate said hed offer him the cash to eat the slug. The then--year-old thought it wont kill me and swallowed it. However in the days that followed Liam started feeling lethargic and his muscles stopped working. He told news.au: “I went to hospital and they thought it might be my appendix. So they took that out. But the doctors were wrong and within hours he was naked in an ambulance with paramedics trying to reduce his temperature. The slug he had eaten carried a parasitic worm - and it was shutting down his body just like tragic teen Sam Ballard - who also ate a slug for a dare.  When the slug died, the worm found a new home in his spinal cord and “basically ate its way up to my brain”, said Liam. The now--year-old fell into a coma and doctors at Royal Brisbane Hospital kept him in it for four months and pumped his body full of steroids. His mother was told to to “plan his funeral” and that he had a one-in- million shot at surviving. Then he woke up — a shadow of his former self. “When I went in, I weighed kg. When I came out of the coma, I was kg. My thigh looked like my wrist, just skin hanging off it,” Liam said.  “I had to learn how to eat, speak, walk, everything all over again. I knew how to do it but getting my brain to tell my body how to do it was another thing.” Speech therapy followed for four months and after much hard work he has now regained “ per cent” of his former le. Last week he was reminded of how lucky he is. Sam Ballard, , died on Friday surrounded by family in Sydney’s north, eight years after he ate a slug as a dare. Mr Ballard contracted the same disease — eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis — and spent  days in a coma. When he woke, he had an acquired brain injury that meant he needed   care and could not feed himself.  When news broke that Sam had passed away, Liam’s phone lit up with messages from friends thankful that he didn’t suffer the same fate. “All my friends and family saw Sam’s article and tagged me in it,” Liam said. “I think about it all the time. That could’ve been me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"1000 arabs expected in dingwall as dundee united sell out ross county ticket allocation","story":"Dundee United have sold out their allocated tickets for the Championship clash against Ross County in the Highlands.Arabs have backed their side in huge numbers since Robbie Neilson took over last month.The Tangerines have snapped up the -ticket allocation given to them for the game in Dingwall but fans can also get them at the ground and many more are expected to cheer on their side.Up to , Terrors are expected and are sure to give a vocal backing for their side in what is, arguably, the biggest game of the season as they look to close the gap on leaders Ayr United.United took , Arabs with them to their last away game at Dunfermline and the resurgent support has been duly noted.According to the Federation of Dundee United Supporters# Clubs, buses to every away game have been full since Neilson took charge.A brief statement read [sic]: #Committee meeting tonight and it was pointed out every bus has been fully booked by the start of the week since Robbie took over.#Great effort Arabs.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget. We have managed to do this without compulsory redundancies and at the same time have still invested in important projects across the Highlands ndash such as new schools, roads and free wi-fi.\"A major concern is the councilrsquos financial reserves which are at their \"lowest levels in recent history\" requiring immediate action.\"We were estimating a pound million overspend in quarter one ndash but our officers have been working extremely hard to reduce this and we are now predicting a more positive out-turn with an overspend of pound. million,\" Cllr Mackinnon said. \"This is not ideal, but moving in the right direction. We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard. This is your council and your future.\"Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118276.jpg","title":"Christmas tree t heading

I came here to win things. We’ve won all  league games and the Aberdeenshire Cup and we want to keep winning.”Cove manager John Sheran said: “Playing Forres is always tough, but I felt we were dominant and in control for the majority of the time.“We played some great football and on another day there could have been more goals but the keeper had some good saves and we were unlucky.“After a - defeat to Formartine in the Aberdeenshire Shield it was good to bounce back with three points.“I don’t like to single people out but I thought Jamie Masson and Blair Yule in the middle of the park were outstanding.“But the whole team played well and that was the pleasing thing that they showed a great appetite and hunger to work hard.”On five minutes the visitors should have led. Simon Allan’s free-kick was met by Ross MacPherson, Stuart McKenzie saved the powerful header but with the goal gaping MacPherson nodded the rebound wide.Two minutes later Cove led when MacRae’s ball found MEGGINSON, the striker wriggled past Callum Howarth on the right side of the area and fired low into the bottom left corner.On  minutes Can-Cans keeper Blair Moir made a fine ing save to keep out Daniel Park’s  yarder.On  minutes Masson was unlucky as his shot from  yards hit the outside of the left post.Three minutes from the interval Moir made a point-blank stop to deny Megginson from three yards after Harry Milne cut the ball back from the left. The crucial second goal came for Cove  minutes into the second half.A corner wasn’t cleared by Forres and the ball was worked out to MASSON who moved in off the left flank and fired an unstoppable right-foot shot into the top right corner.Cove had chances to add to the score. Megginson shot wide on the turn and Milne came close with a low strike before Megginson galloped through but clipped just wide from the left of the penalty area.With  minutes left Forres missed a chance to get back in the game as Scott Moore sent Andrew MacRae through but McKenzie saved his angled shot.In stoppage time Forres’ Graham Fraser was given a straight red card by ref Scott Leslie for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity after he hauled back Jordon Brown  yards out.Forres manager Charlie Rowley said: “I’m delighted with the way we applied ourselves and I thought we showed bravery throughout the game and were beaten by the better side.“I think the red card was an incredible decision because it was  yards from goal and I felt we had two covering defenders that could have got back to cover.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match. The Argyll Derby kicks off at pm and will be played at the Ropework or Joint Campus G, weather permitting."},{"url":null,"title":"all hallows eve with the senior citizens club","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens Club enjoyed a fun filled Halloween afternoon at their fortnightly meeting on Wednesday October .  Those who dressed up ranged from witches, the devil, vampires and ghosts to Shaun the Sheep and created much hilarity, with Lilah the Witch , being declared the Best Dressed.  Topical games were played and enjoyed.  Hostesses, Peta Robb and Diane MacDonald, provided a lovely afternoon tea."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll marks the armistice centenary","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAs we reach the centenary of the signing of the Armistice on the th hour of the th day in the th month,  one of the most striking acts of remembrance will take place in Inveraray.Thousands of poppies, hand knitted by people from near and far and donated to the church, have been hung inside and outside Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church.In Lochgilphead, shop windows have been decorated in a mark of remembrance, with the Armistice Day parade planned to set off from Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall to the war memorial at .am on Sunday.Elsewhere in Argyll, landmarks will be glowing red in support of the Scottish Poppy Appeal and to commemorate of the centenary of the end of the First World War.The war memorial in Campbeltown, Garron Bridge House near  Inveraray and Appin Parish Church will be taking part and on the Isle of Bute, Rothesay Castle, The Glenburn Hotel, the war emorial on Victoria Street, Apple Tree Nursery, The Scottish Honky-Tonk Pub and the Rockabilly Diner are also lighting up.Gordon Michie, Head of Fundraising at Poppyscotland, said: #We wanted to broaden the reach of our Light Up Red campaign in this momentous year as a tribute to those who sacriced so much during the First World War and to shine a light on those who continue to need Poppyscotland’s vital, le-changing support today.#The majority of buildings will be lighting up for the full week up to and including Armistice Day on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"inspire inveraray efforts worthwhile and achievable 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowColin CameronInveraray should have new moorings in Loch Fyne by the time sailors unfurl the mainsails next year.In an update to the Argyllshire Advertiser, Derrick Anstee, director of community company Inspire Inveraray, outlined the group#s latest activities.The company has been awarded a grant from Architectural Heritage Fund to carry out necessary work on Inveraray#s dilapidated community hall.Mr Anstee added: #If An Suidhe [wind farm community fund] comes up with an equal grant, it will mean work will be started soon.He continued: #The current state of the building is poor and as a building at risk some temporary measures were taken to put fencing in place, and this will be replaced with a wooden fence.#As to the future purpose of the community hall site, Mr Anstee said: #All the community surveys carried out over the past few years will be analysed for a community action plan to be distributed to the community.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13548879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166431538.jpg","title":"beith juniors president says club","story":"NewsBeith Juniors president says club are ready for Scottish Cup day with Ayr UnitedThe Mighty president, John Boal, says Ayrs large travelling support will be given a warm welcome at Bellsdale Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsBeith president John Boal\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at Beith Juniors today insisted they are ready and able to host Ayr United in the Scottish Cup.

Accusations of spies lurking furtively in the shadows. And claims of sabotage as posters advertising a “summit” meeting are mysteriously ripped off walls and hoardings. No – it’s not a meeting of the Klu Klux Klan in Hickory Hollow, Arakansas in the s. And no . . . it’s not a clandestine, cover-up being leaked in the basement of Washington’s Watergate Hotel in the s. This is Troon, South Ayrshire  . . . and the cloak-and-dagger involves the proposed take-over of a community activity centre. It’s Dundonald Gymnastics Clubversus Muirhead Tennants and Residents Association . And in the middle we have SAC. Normally this would mean South Ayrshire Council . . . but in this case, it really stands for Sell All Centres. Andthere’s room for another acronym – let’s throw in the real reason behind this rammy – it’s called C.A.T . . . Community Asset Transfer. SAC wants to get Muirhead Activity Centre – and its running costs – off its books. DCG – a well organised and well funded gymnastic club – would love it as their new permanent home. They’re currently based in Dundonald Activity Centre – but having to move vaulting horses and other equipment after every session is apparently getting in the way of healthy exercise. With DACattached to Dundonald Primary School and protected from CAT, the Muirhead building is a sitting target for them. But DGC operate classes seven days a week – and a take-over would leave little or no room for other sports and clubs that currently use Muirhead. And it’s this possible exclusion of other sports and interests - by a single self-serving club - that has rightly upset MTRA. But the real villain in this localised skirmish is the Community Asset Transfer policy itself. Our local council is using it as a convenient back door to off load the expense of running village halls and community properties across the whole of South Ayrshire. Interestingly, last week’s Budget - in a nod to the centenary of  – announced extra funding to protect and preserve the many village halls built to help small communities recover from the ravages of the Great War. In stark contrast, South Ayrshire Council wants to wash their hands of them! The Muirhead decision will finally fall to a full SAC meeting. It will be interesting to seethe four elected Troon councillors look their constituents in the eye – or choose to look away in line with council policy. From where I sit, Dundonald Gymnastics Club has  plus members, a waiting list, over  internet followers and employs more coaches than Dodds of Troon. It appears everyone and their auntie wants to see the wean wearing a wee blue leotard and a medal. That’s fine. But surely not at the expense of other children with other interests and needs. If DGC want a place to themselves – let them find it and fund it themselves.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilSchoolsWorld War TroonDundonaldAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556297.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS166933205.jpg","title":"cafe owners ayrs newmarket street","story":"NewsCafe owners in Ayrs Newmarket Street pay tribute to businessman Craig BrysonKaren and Nino Pajovic say they have lost \"one of their own\" in the passing of Craig Bryson, .ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsNino and Karen with their tribute \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCafe owners in Ayr’s Newmarket Street this week led tributes to their “loyal friend” Craig Bryson.

Lieutenant Walter Tull, was Britain’s second black professional footballer who had signed up with Rangers, and trained as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Walter- along with millions of other soldiers- will be honoured on Sunday, November  in a nationwide gesture of remembrance. A large-scale portrait of Walter Tull designed by sand artists Sand In Your Eye, will be drawn into the sand on the beach and washed away as the tide comes in. And the public will be asked to join in by creating silhouettes of people in the sand, remembering the millions of lives lost or changed forever by the conflict. The project is the latest collaboration between the National Theatre of Scotland and - NOW, the UK’s arts programme for the World War  centenary, and will use  beaches all around the UK as their canvasses for the mass art-work. Each of the beaches taking part in the project will commemorate a dferent WW casualty.  Walter Tull was born to Alice Elizabeth Palmer, from Kent, and Daniel Tull from Barbados, the son of a slave, on April , . After the death of his parents he and his brother Edward were placed in a children’s home in Bethnal Green. Edward was later adopted and it is believed that he went on to be Britain’s first black dentist after taking over his father’s practice on St Vincent Street in Glasgow. Walter, however, began playing football with Tottenham Hotspur in , and after touring South America with them he was offered a contract, making him the second black professional footballer in Britain. When playing for Tottenham and later Northampton Town he faced a lot of racial abuse and prejudice, yet he went on to have a successful football career. In , Northampton Town began negotiations to transfer Tull to Glasgow Rangers. However, the First World War broke out before Tull could play a game for Rangers. He enlisted as a private in the Footballers’ Battalion of the British Army, where he was quickly promoted to be a sergeant. He took part in and survived the Battle of the Somme, after which he was sent to England to recover from illness. He then went to train as an officer cadet in Gailes, Ayrshire. Although black officers were not allowed in the British Army at this time, he was commissioned in May , thus becoming the first black combat officer in the British Army. He died in battle in France in , during the last major German offensive. His body was never found. Walter will be remembered this Sunday as the public pay their respects to millions of fallen servicemen. • Activities on Ayr beach will happen between .am and am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnBritish ArmyArmed forcesAdoptionWorld War Ayr United FCAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives step up hunt armed","story":"NewsDetectives step up their hunt for armed thugs who attacked and attempted to rob woman in her homeShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsPolice are now appealing for information after the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives today have stepped up their hunt for two armed thugs who attacked a terried woman and tried rob her in her Ayr home.

The council will shell out pound on hospitality for the delegation from the large city of Liaocheng in mid November.

Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “Across the world China is a huge player in the economic infrastructure.” The Scotland-China Innovation and Technology Association have spotted similarities between South Ayrshire and Liaocheng. The delegation, which includes the Liaocheng Mayor, will also visit Edinburgh and St Andrews. The city is located in the western Shandong province of China. Councillor William Grant said: “I think there is tremendous potential to work with one of the big players in the world.” The report put before councillors said the itinerary would offer a flavour of South Ayrshire in terms of culture, tourism, business and education. The report said: “It is anticipated that the overall itinerary will result in a highly positive and memorable experience for the Chinese delegates.” They will arrive on November  for two days on the quest to find a twin region in Scotland.

The incident along with other concerns has sparked a proposed shake-up of taxi and private hire rules. The middle seat in the front could be ditched from fleets of larger vehicles following a public consultation. The public are going to be askedpeople should still be allowed to sit in the front of vehicles. The consultation will also questionthe number of passengers sitting up front should be reduced to one. South Ayrshire Council’s Leadership Panel heard last week how the middle passenger was seated too close to drivers. A report presented to councillors said the close proximity left drivers open to accusations of “inappropriate conduct. Explaining one incident reported to the council,licensing team leader Morag Douglas said: “There were concerns that a driver was threatened by young girls who booked a private hire. “They left without paying and stated thatthe driver took any action the driver would be reported to the police for inappropriate conduct.” She said the council received other gripes from drivers about what a tight squeeze it is with two passengers in the front. Ms Douglas told how drivers said having “two larger people in the front seats” meant it is dficult to control the car without touching middle seat passengers. All eight seater vehicles licensed by the council have two passenger seats in the front and six in the back. Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “It is as much about protecting the drivers as the passengers.” He added: “We need to be cautious and make sure that whatever we come up with doesn’t have unintended consequences.” Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils don’t permit passengers in the front seats of taxis. Feedback from South Ayrshire Taxi and Private Hire Operators’ Forum members suggested the inidual drivers should decidethey want passengers up front. The members also told the council there should still be an option to have two passengers seated in the front. There are  licensed taxis and  private hire vehicles in South Ayrshire. The specicationsapproved would only apply to newly licenced vehicles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGlasgowAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13556455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS69111168.jpg","title":"tributes paid ayr united legend","story":"NewsTributes paid to Ayr United legend Johnny Graham, who dies aged The Somerset Park legend died last week, aged , and tributes have been led by former teammate Jim McSherry.ShareByMike Wilson:,  NOV NewsJohnny Graham at a packed Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWarm tributes are being paid to Johnny Graham, the skipper who led Ayr United into the first ever Premier League.

I remember when Ayr beat Rangers - that first season all the headlines went to Johnny Doyle but Graham gave a masterclass in midfield. He was a terric player and a leader.” Terracing fans posted emotional messages on Facebook as they mourned the loss of the Somerset Park legend. Honest Man veteran Lawrence Grace wrote: “RIP to one of the greatest players to wear an Ayr strip.” Ronnie Hainey added: “One of my favourite players and one of the best.” Robert Somerville said: “Sad news. True Ayr legend, penalty king and all round great.” Allan Durward recalled: “I’ve great memories of the ‘s as a boy, Johnny Graham, Ingram, Doyle, McCulloch, etc. RIP.”  Johnny began his career with Strathclyde Juniors before going on to play for Third Lanark, Dundee United, Falkirk and Hibs. He joined Ayr for pound, in  and went on to score  goals in  games. In October of his first season, he scored all four as Ayr came from - down to beat Airdrie - at Broomfield. Amazingly, he repeated the four goal haul in the second last game that same season when Ayr beat Partick Thistle - at Somerset. Ally handed him the captaincy in - and great times continued as Ayr beat Dunfermline - in April  – player of the year Johnny scored twice – to secure a place in the inaugural Premier League. Graham twice played for the Scottish Football League XI. He ed to Falkirk at the start of season - but within two years came back to Ayr as reserve team coach.

They will both have entrances facing out over the car park beside Boots and have attracted seven objections. Landowner Red Button is already quids in after getting permission to reduce the size of the car park and build a Costa coffee unit. But planners say only two car parking spaces will be lost in this application. Originally it was planned to build just one larger store on the loading area but permission has now lapsed. A report before next Thursday’s South Ayrshire Council planning committee says: “It’s considered the proposal will not have an adverse impact on the residential character or amenity of the locality. “Accordingly, the application is recommended for approval.” Objectors in Academy Street and Academy Court have hit out over traffic concerns, the impact on local homes, of servicing the other units and why the town needs more retail space when some units are empty. Resident Mark Inglis called for the entrance into the entire precinct to be shted to Portland Street. He said: “There are around  children who are being dropped off and picked up or making their own way to school or nursery and the additional traffic will increase the risk of signicant harm to children. “There is also a sheltered housing complex directly opposite the proposed development with some infirm and elderly people within, the additional traffic on Academy Street I believe will also pose a risk to them and their well being, and increased risk of accident and perhaps fatality.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-2018-the-best-sports-deals","story":"*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

IIn the final minutes the Pupils were denied what seemed a stonewall penalty.Who knows what the score would have beenit had been given and converted.Looking forward to a better team performance, Campbeltown Pupils travel to play Easthall in the league tomorrow.Gary Grumoli was in the thick of the action till going off injured in the closing moments. _cpupilsSary Rahma caught in a balletic move in front of the Neilston goal. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter campbeltowns role in the perisher","story":"Shortly before the war ended in , HMS Thames, the submarine depot ship, arrived at Campbeltown with her attendant submarines.The Thames was the base for the Periscope School which trained submarine commanding officers in the principles of attacking.The submarines were used to put theory into practice.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river.

And right here is where you start paying hellip in sweat.Imagine, then, my excitement when I found out that itrsquos not too late to don a leotard and pair of footless tights ndash legwarmers optional ndash and release my inner ballerina.Adult ballet is a fast growing trend, thanks mostly to the revived interest in dance sparked by the reality TV series Strictly Come Dancing.There are now adult classical ballet classes for Absolute Beginners at Scottish Ballet, where you can learn how to do a plieacute without the pressure of feeling like a failureyou donrsquot make the corps de ballet.Anybody of any age, shape or fitness level can and does take part in these classes. Ballet is great for fitness, boosting cardio, strength and flexibility, co-ordination and balance and is weight-bearing so it helps build muscles and bones. Ballet burns  calories an hour ndash more than a spin class ndash and is fantastic for posture and is also a known stress buster.There are waiting lists to get on the Scottish Ballet -week courses for absolute beginner, beginner and intermediate dancers and I found out why when I signed up for an absolute beginnersrsquo class there.Dance teacher Preston Clare is not quite as strict as Debbie Allenrsquos character Lydia Grant in Fame, but he does insist on correct technique with his students, who range in age from  to late s.ldquoI want everyone to be safe, so I teach them how to bend with their knees over the toes and the proper way to move through the foot against the floor so there arenrsquot any injuries, he says.One of the joys of teaching this class, Preston says, is watching the transformation in his students.ldquoTherersquos one man who is quite heavy. He had such a curved spine and hunched shoulders that when he lay flat on his back, his head couldnrsquot touch the floor. After a few weeks of ballet, he can now lie flat and hersquos lost a lot of weight.One of the reasons ballet is such an effective way to change your body, he explains, is the music ndash classes at Scottish ballet are accompanied by pianist Michael Barnett.ldquoProfessional ballet dancers have the physiques of athletes but dance is an art form, not a sport. The music lts you up ndash it helps you reach that bit further.Preston shows me into the large, bright studio at Scottish Balletrsquos headquarters at the Tramway in Glasgow. I gaze longingly at a pile of colourful tutus stacked outside the class but have to content myself with what Irsquom wearing: gym gear I usually wear to pilates. I notice the other women are in black leotards and tights with flippy little ballet skirts, but at least I have proper soft ballet shoes.Irsquove always been hopeless at learning new steps and Irsquom a little nervous about looking like one of the dancing hippos in Disneyrsquos Fantasia. However, Preston reassures me that everyone starts out the same.ldquoRelax and have fun, he says. ldquoMy students know they are not going to join a ballet company they are here to enjoy themselves. I love teaching adult beginners because they are so dedicated.Alexandra Lesley, an actress in her early s, and her partner, Keith Hooley, , are certainly committed: they travel from Thornhill in Dumfriesshire to attend the class once a week, a round trip of three hours.ldquoI love it. I get such a buzz and come out walking on air, says Alexandra. ldquoBallet keeps me fit and flexible.Keith, a retired quality controller, says: ldquoAlexandra encouraged me to go with her and I really enjoy it. My sciatica cleared up after one class and I donrsquot slouch any more. It also helps to keep my mind sharp ndash ballet doesnrsquot just exercise your muscles, joints and ligaments. At home we practise in the kitchen, using the counter tops as a barre.Josh Polson, , a teacher from Glasgow, has been impressed by how much more flexible and stronger he is playing American football since starting ballet last year. He was inspired to take up ballet after seeing his girlfriend, who is with Scottish Ballet, on stage.ldquoIrsquod never done anything like this before and wanted to see how dficult it was. Now I have even more respect for my girlfriend and how hard she works.Josh, too, finds the benefits arenrsquot just physical.ldquoI have a stressful job teaching children with behavioural dficulties. Ballet is very calming and allows me to switch off because Irsquom focusing so much on the steps.Itrsquos time for me to join the class. We start off with some simple barre exercises and I soon get into the swing of things, despite wobbling when we have to let go the barre and balance on tiptoe on one leg. Preston keeps the atmosphere light with some teasing and jokes and Irsquom soon having fun.ldquoThis is easy-peasy, I think, dreaming of skipping straight to beginners. But it soon gets harder as we move into a Polonaise ndash a skipping, sliding dance invented by Louis IV, to allow men at his court to show off their calves. I soon get mixed up with the steps but manage to keep up. The pirouette is trickier to master as you have to whip your head around as you turn to avoid being dizzy. I end up dizzy ndash and hot and sweaty.Ballet is much harder than I expected and the next day my calf, arm and stomach muscles ache.A beginnersrsquo over-s class, surely, will be easier. But the class at Dance Factory on Glasgowrsquos Southside, is also demanding. After a few simple barre exercises, I end up tripping over two left feet during the dance sequence. I can sort of do the graceful arms, though, and channel Margot Fonteyn. The other women skip about with confidence, landing softly when they jump, their backs straight and arms properly swan-like. They may be in their s and s, but there isnrsquot a middle-aged spread or dowagerrsquos hump to be seen.ldquoBallet is excellent for strengthening your core and improving posture, says dance teacher Olivia McLay. ldquoItrsquos good for menopausal women because it builds bone mass ndash bones begin to thin at that age. It improves physical and mental agility, helps with balance, co-ordination and memory because you have to learn a sequence of steps.ldquoI sleep better, Irsquom stronger and feel more stretched and mindful, says Linda Weir, , from Glasgow. lsquoI just love it and would recommend it as a way to be stronger and fitter. Irsquove also made friends.Alison Lock, , from Glasgow said: ldquoItrsquos a physical and mental workout. Itrsquos much more fun than going to the gym, and it has stopped me feeling isolated.Linda Trainor, , was a talented ballerina as a child who won a scholarship at to the Royal Academy of Dance, but had to leave when her mother died.ldquoI always felt there was a hole in my le and itrsquos been wonderful to go back to ballet, even this late in le. It makes me happy.The many physical and mental benefits are the reason Scottish Ballet has classes for people with dementia, Parkinsonrsquos Disease, and a class for the elderly called Regenerate. Soon there will a class for people with multiple sclerosis.ldquoThere are proven benefits, says Catherine Cassidy, director of engagement at Scottish Ballet, who has seen a growing interest in the adult beginnersrsquo classes since they started three years ago.ldquoBallet improves balance, co-ordination and fluidity of movement. The music and rhythm combined with visualising unfolding your wings like a swan, for example, helps people with neurological conditions to move.ldquoBallet is also relaxing and gives you a sense of achievement as you master new skills. The mental health benefits are huge.Kerry Livingstone, head of the associatesrsquo programme at Scottish Ballet and head of Ballet at the Royal Conservatoire, says: ldquoIn these fast-paced days of social media and constant interruptions from emails and text messages, ballet forces you to concentrate fully and is great for mindfulness. It gives you self-discipline and because itrsquos an art, itrsquos uplting and creative.Undeterred by my clumsiness and encouraged by Preston and Olivia, Irsquove signed up for an Absolute Beginners course at Scottish Ballet ndash and Irsquom absolutely loving it.Ill never be the next Darcy Bussell but Irsquoll hopefully be stronger, more flexible and have the poise and graceful posture of a ballerina.See www.scottishballet and www.dancefactory"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-calendar-captures-the-beauty-of-scotland","story":"Herald calendar captures the beauty of ScotlandAn early morning view of the River Shiel near to Acharacle, on the Ardnamurchan ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtpeninsula.

Compose your image, donrsquot just go running at it. Walk around. I try to do that so that when I get to the screen, therersquos very little left to do.ldquoMy camera is a Canon D that I bought from Archie. Itrsquos not like the huge cameras you can get nowadays.

I also have a mm-m Canon, which is a great lens but I havenrsquot used it as often as I thought I would.ldquoI always use a tripod and a remote control when Irsquom doing serious pictures ndash I prefer not to hand-hold the camera in that sort of situation, involving long exposures. If yoursquore shooting a waterfall you might need an exposure of three or four seconds, for example.At first, Mr Stokes did wildle photography, ldquobut there is so much time involved in it, he says. ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking, trying to get a bird to land in a specic place or a squirrel to do your bidding. But landscape photography has its own heartache as well. You can run down to a scene where there are perfect reflections in the water but by the time you get down to the loch, it is full of ripples hellip and it drives it nuts, but that is all part of the fun.His shot of Buachaille Etive Mograver was taken from the frozen river at Kingshouse Hotel, in Glencoe. And at Loch Awe his eye was caught by the ldquototal flat calm of the reflection.ldquoThe two shots were bonus pictures, as I call them. Irsquom usually up at four in the morning when I leave Dunoon and Irsquom up north in pitch darkness, waiting for sunrise. Then I work my way through til about pm and I think, thatrsquoll do me.ldquoI shot both Buachaille and Loch Awe on my way home, though I donrsquot think they were on the same day. But it was nice to look at them once I got home.His work in The Heraldrsquos daily picture slot certainly has its fans.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees.

In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

Professor Norman Drummond, the former army chaplain who chaired the Scottish First World War commemorations , made it clear in his address that the service, attended by over , people including Princess Anne and the First Minister, was not just about then, but now as well. The memory of the Great War, he said, was a tool for the living and a warning not to let politics get out of hand. No one referred to anything ndash or anyone ndash specic, but the congregation will have had their own ideas about what he could mean.The service had started in the light at pm and ended in the dark an hour later in a day full of symbols. At am, pipers played laments all over the country, at .am cathedral bells began to ring out and at am, thousands of Scots made the traditional gesture of silence, which this year was given added poignancy because it marked what came to be called the Great Silence: the days and weeks after the guns stopped on November , .The service at Glasgow Cathedral was the focal point of the day and, in words and music, concentrated on four themes: first, sadness at the loss of lealso, the sense of victory against the odds and the seeds of social change ndash the congregation was reminded that the Glasgow rent strikes happened just a short walk from the cathedral.The fourth theme was one that perhaps some might feel less certain about in uncertain times: courage for the future. In his prayer, Professor Drummond quoted the Canadian medical officer Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae: ldquoTo you from failing hands we throw the torch be yours to hold it high. That torch of hope and love, said Professor Drummond, continues to be thrown to each and every one of us, in our homes and in our families, in our communities and across the nation. But the torch is not as bright in some places as others, the places where war is still happening,  years later.One of the next generation taking the torch symbolically at the cathedral was ten-year-old Cara Lucas from Peebles who read the prayer of St Francis of Assisi. ldquoLord make me an instrument of your peace she said, but the words were especially poignant because Cararsquos family knows peace is far from being sorted yet: Cararsquos father Alexander James Lucas was a Royal Marine Commando when he was killed in action in Afghanistan on November , . He was  years old.Cararsquos reading was among the many words of peace and hope in the service, but there were also reminders of the greatest tragedies. Such as the fact the signing of the armistice did not immediately mean the end of the killing. It was signed very early in the morning but a few hours later, at .am, trooper George Ellison of the th Royal Lancers died near Mons. He is the last known British soldier to be killed. Scottish battalions also continued to be involved in operations until  and in southern Russian until .The music at the service reflected the desire, or duty, to remember these stories ndash at one point the Glasgow Cathedral Choir, their voices beautully filling the nave, repeated one refrain ldquowe will remember them. And the service reflected how valuable music was to the men in the trenches by including Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag. The bit in the song about lighting your fag may not have quite the resonance it once had, but it was one of the most moving moments of the service when the congregation sang the song in  just as men would have done in the trenches in .The music also focused on particular stories ndash like John Lauder, the son of the great Scottish entertainer Sir Harry Lauder. Soloist Amy Hawthorn and the congregation sang perhaps Lauderrsquos most famous song Keep Right on the End of the Road. The words are still inspiring, especially when sung by a thousand people: ldquo yoursquore tired and weary still, journey on til you come to your happy abode. But the congregation was reminded why Sir Harry wrote it: his son was killed in action in December . Sir Harry decided the show had to go on and ed to the stage just a few days later.The congregation at Glasgow also included the descendants of some of those who died in the war, including the family of four Glasgow brothers, including William Herbert Anderson who was awarded the Victoria Cross. Lieutenant Colonel William Herbert Anderson, known as Bertie, was commanding the th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, as it moved through France in March . He was awarded the VC for leading his command in a double-counter attack, successfully driving the enemy away despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered. However, his bravery cost him his le and he died behind enemy lines on  March  at the age of .Bertie was the last of four brothers to perish in the war ndash Charlie had died on  December  at the age of , followed by Ronnie on  October  at the age of . Both had also served in the Highland Light Infantry. A week before Bertiersquos death, his youngest brother Teddie, who had transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, went down in a plane over Winchester on  March  aged just .Bertiersquos great-grandson, Robin Scott-Elliot, who attended the commemoration with his we Karen and their daughters Iona and Torrin, said he had always found it hard to imagine what his ancestors suffered.ldquoItrsquos unthinkable what the parents of Bertie, Charlie, Ronnie and Teddie must have gone through, losing all four sons in less than four years, he said. ldquoWhen I think about when they died in relation to my age now, Irsquom struck by how truly short their lives were.ldquoThe impact of their deaths was felt in the family for years ndash their parents never recovered, and my grandfather, who was a toddler at the time of Bertiersquos death, had to go through le without a father - an experience which was shared by many after the war.ldquoI am very proud of the brave actions of my great-grandfather and great-uncles. Itrsquos so important to pass these stories on to the next generation so that the devastation caused by the war is never forgotten.Iona Scott-Elliot, aged , great-great granddaughter of Bertie, added: ldquoI think we should always try to remember my great-great grandad and all the other men and women like him even though they died a long time ago.It would be hard to put it better than Iona did, but the Glasgow service did succeed in pointing out that the centenary commemorations have to be about more than remembering.The service reminded the congregation, and the audience watching on BBC, that amongst the troops at the front line there was relief at having survived but there was also anger and resentment too about what they had been put through.Some good came from that anger and restlessness ndash the vote was extended to all men over and to women over . But the service reminded us too that the lessons of the Great War were not immediately learned ndash there was a determination to be as hard as possible on the Germans in the peace negotiations after the war - and so - as we know - the seeds of the Second World War were sewn.This concern about how we learn the lessons of war and peace was reflected in one of the most powerful readings by Gurjit Singh Lali, a member of the Scottish commemorations . He quoted Gandhi: ldquoI am a man of peace, I believe in peace but I do not want peace at any price. I do not want the peace that you find in the grave. There were also words from King George V speaking in Flanders in . ldquoCan there be more potent advocates of peace upon the earth, he asked, ldquo than this massed multitude of silent witness to the desolation of war Norman Drummond explored similar themes in his address. Four years ago, when the commemorations began and a service was held in Glasgow Cathedral in , Professor Drummond asked an important question: what have we learned from all this  There were some who were critical of the idea of four years of remembrance and still are. Others asked whether it was right for then PM David Cameron to spend poundmillion on the commemorations. Part of the justication was that we should learn from the past and teach future generations, but four years on, Professor Drummond, and everyone , is still trying to find an answer to his question: what have we learned from all this In his address to the congregation, Professor Drummond said personal connections to war were important and had become more important over the last four years ndash cupboards were opened, boxes found, and letters from a century ago read and re-read. But Professor Drummond said he had learned that certain values are timeless ndash loyalty, devotion, courage, resilience. The lesson was to be there for each other ndash to be the stretcher bearer, in war and peace, for those in any kind of need.The final words of the service and the final powerful symbol went to the Right Revd Susan Brown, the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Mrs Brown admits herself that she is not a big woman, but her voice was big in a cathedral that was bigger. Remember the poppy, she said. The black at its centre is the blackness of war. The red of its leaves is the red of blood. But most important of all is the green of its stem, she said, because that is the green shoot of hope.And the last bit of music in a service of music  That went to Andy Cant, who started the service with his violin high up in the roof of the cathedral. For the closing moments, he switched to the pipes and ended Scotlandrsquos act of remembrance with a wordless gesture that was perhaps its most moving. A lone piper sounding out clearly, powerfully and hopefully.The service at the cathedral was the centrepiece of a poignant day of remembrance that started before the sun came up. The first act of commemoration was at am when pipers across the country, standing in the dark, played Battlersquos Orsquoer, the traditional lament that is often heard at the end of war.Many of the pipers played at their local war memorial, but the lament was also heard at the Forth Bridge, and Cpl McClintock of Sqn ATC had the honour of piping Battles Orsquoer at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey. The lament was also heard at Ibrox Stadium.Just a few hours later, at .am, the bells of Dunblane Cathedral were rung to mark the moment  years ago when the bells were rung at the end of the war. Across the day, church bells were also rung in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling ndash some by new bell-ringers recruited over the last year to commemorate the , British bellringers who died between  and .There were other, new ways to remember too, starting at Ayr beach in the morning. Slowly, as a group of volunteers worked away on the sand yesterday, a face emerged, only to be washed away later by the tide. The face on Ayr beach was of Walter Tull, the first black officer in the British Army and one of British footballrsquos first black players. Tull had signed for Rangers when he was  but was killed while engaged in combat near Arras in Northern France. Yesterday, the sea slowly erased the sand-painting of his face as a reminder of his sad loss.Similar events were staged at other beaches across the UK, including West Sands at St Andrews, where they commemorated Elsie Inglis, a pioneering surgeon and suffragist. Other beaches taking part in the project in Scotland were Scapa beach, Orkney, St Ninianrsquos beach, Shetland, Roseisle beach, Moray, and Culla Bay on Benbecula.The beach events were the idea of the filmmaker Danny Boyle, who said they seemed the perfect place to reflect some of the consequences of the Great War. ldquoBeaches are truly public spaces, where nobody rules other than the tide, he said. ldquoThey seem the perfect place to gather and say a final goodbye and thank you to those whose lives were taken or forever changed by the First World War.The beach remembrance events happened throughout the day but it was at am that most of the country took part. The Armistice was signed in  in Compiegne and came into force on the th hour of the th day of the th month and at the same time  years later politicians, civic leaders, veterans and relatives gathered to mark the centenary at the symbolic centres of remembrance across the country.At the Cenotaph in London, the Prince of Wales led the Royal Familyrsquos tributes as the Queen looked on from a balcony. Charles laid a wreath on behalf of his mother for the second year in a row, while an equerry laid a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh.In a signicant and hopeful break with history, the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was also present and laid a wreath on behalf of the German people. It is the first time since the Cenotaph was inaugurated in  that a representative of the country has taken part in the UKrsquos national service of remembrance.At am precisely, the traditional two minutes of silence was held, but there was also a signicant and welcome sound: the chimes of Big Ben. The clock is being renovated and has been silent since August  when works began, but it has been fitted with a custom-built electronic mechanism built to power the striking hammer to ensure it can still sound for important national events.In Scotland, the am silence was observed at the Cenotaph in Glasgowrsquos George Square, while in Edinburgh First Minister Nicola Sturgeon laid a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance outside the City Chambers.Following the service, the city then thanked those who served with a procession from St Gilesrsquo Cathedral to the steps of the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle. The memorial houses and displays the rolls of honour of Scots servicemen and women from all the armed services, the Dominions, Merchant Navy, Womenrsquos Services, Nursing Services and civilian casualties of all wars.By the time darkness fell after pm, the remembrance took on a new shape at the Scottish Parliament when the names of the , men and women from the rolls of honour were projected on to the building. Along with Scottish servicemen, the names included nurses, munitions factory workers, Merchant Navy personnel, and overseas servicemen.The scale of the loss was reflected by the fact it took seven hours to show all the names, finishing around midnight. Each name shone on the building for around  seconds to the sound of Sir John Blackwood McEwenrsquos String Quartets Volume  by the Chilingrian Quartet. There were also images and designs that tell the story of the global war.The presiding officer Ken Macintosh said it was a striking tribute. ldquoThe fact it will take seven hours to project the names of all those who died reflects the sheer scale of the loss and devastation the warhad on communities right across Scotland, he said.The parliamentrsquos tribute was not the only light of hope and peace that shone into the dark evening. Shortly before pm, Shetlander Geoffrey Priest made his way to Saxa Vord, in the north of Unst, where he lit a beacon that was the centrepiece of the islandrsquos commemoration of the centenary. It is no surprise that Shetland would want to mark the sombre occasion, as  Shetland men lost their lives in the First World War ndash a higher proportion than anywhere  in Britain.Finally, the day and night of commemoration came to an end at .pm when an audience of around  filled the Usher Hall in Edinburgh for a performance of the multimedia production Far, Far from Ypres, which brings the story of prototypical Scots soldier Jimmy McDonald to le through songs, poems and real stories.The show featured large screen projection of images from the war and a cast of folk singers who remained on stage throughout the performance, singing the lsquotrenchrsquo, lsquomarchingrsquo and Music Hall songs of the time.Jimmyrsquos story brought the day of remembrance to an end and there was then a chance for Professor Norman Drummond to reflect on what has been learned over the last four years.Professor Drummond told The Herald that he wanted the last four years of commemoration to reflect a theme of reconciliation but also education.ldquoWhen I was invited by the Scottish Government to chair and set up the Scottish Commemorations Panel, I accepted on three conditions ndash that it would concentrate on education, genealogy and legacy and we asked: what do we learn from all this  he said. \"I think the Scottish commemorations have been pivotal in reminding us that this is not just remembrance ndash important though that is ndash but itrsquos about what we take forward to the future.ldquoWe live in ided times and I think the First World War gives us evidence of what happens when we let politics get out of hand.Professor Drummond and his family have also felt the last four years personally. His grandfather Norman Walker, who served on the Western Front, where he was badly gassed, was awarded the MC in . Later, he was an international cricketer and played for Scotland ndash all on one lung.ldquoI was about seven or eight when he died, said Professor Drummond, ldquobut I can identy with those who wish they could talk to those who are no longer with us, to ask them: what was it really like Professor Drummondrsquos we Elizabeth also has personal connections to the conflict through her grandfather John Burn, of the Tyneside Scottish, serving with the Northumberland Fusiliers. He was killed on the th September  and, earlier this year, Professor Drummond and his we went out to Johnrsquos grave in France.ldquoThere we were, he said, ldquo years on, around one grave almost to the hour of when he would have been killed.Professor Drummond said he wanted the day to reflect four themes ndash the first being a collective sadness at the loss of le. Historians still argue about the precise number of Scots who lost their lives but we can safely say that over , died.And it was particularly poignant on the centenary of the end of the war to note that many soldiers died on the last day itself, including  Scots.The second theme was victory and Professor Drummond acknowledged that it was not just about joy but profound mixed emotions.He also hopes that the commemorations over the last four years have struck the right tone. He said: ldquoWersquove always tried to have the appropriate tone and the advice wersquove received is that, yes, the victory was important at that time ndash therefore, we commemorate it from a long lens. But there was joy and relief that it was all over and that we had withstood overwhelming odds and were really proud of the way our men and women responded.The third theme was seeds of change ndash an effort to reflect the fact that the First World War led, in the short and longer term, to economic, social, cultural and political changes."},{"url":null,"title":"wind-turbines-generating-98-of-scotlands-electricity-demand","story":"WWF Scotland said that National Grid demand for the month was ,, MWh and that almost all of this could have been provided by wind turbines, which provided record levels of power.Turbines generated the equivalent of % of all Scotlands electricity demand or enough to power nearly five million homes last month, the group said.Read more:End oil and gas and hit the worst emitters hard ndash how Scotland could fight climate changeThe best day was October  when turbines generated ,.

But in , Countess Haig, we of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, suggested that a factory, employing those men disabled by war, should be created to make poppies for Scotland. First based in an old wood-chopping factory in the grounds of Whitefoord House in Edinburgh, it moved in  to an old printing works in the city’s Warriston Road.And after this year’s very special Armistice centenary year, the factory will be on the move again – albeit on a temporary basis.A team of around  ex-servicemen and women who hand-assemble more than five million poppies and , wreaths every year for the Scottish Poppy Appeal will be moving to Redford Barracks for two years to allow for a much-needed refurbishment of the factory.The aim is not to rip out the heart of what is a very special workplace – boasting regimental flags and thank you letters and posters from the thousands of school children who have visited.But some £. million from the Libor Fund – fines imposed on banks for manipulation of Libor levels – will ensure the factory is fit for the st Century.Overseeing the move immediately after this year’s Remembrance Day will be factory manager Charlie Pelling, who has been at the helm since .During a tour of the factory, Charlie explained more about the move.He said: “We’ll be moving on November  with the aim of being operational by the start of January.“The aim is to be back at our factory in time for the  or  appeal.“We have a small window of opportunity to make the move as the factory operates year round.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buteman webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Special year...for PoppyScotland with Gordon Michie, its head of fundraising, hoping to raise an additional #, from the  Poppy Pledge campaign. \"  \"  Armistice : PoppyScotland’s  Poppy Pledge campaign viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUTE | Article Teaser\"“We are like a toy shop in that we work  months of the year with sales throughout that period but our sales climax in the run-up to Remembrance Day in the way a toy shop does at Christmas.“We’ve got to strip out asbestos from the factory, update the heating and wiring, modernise the windows and install a lt to the first floor.“We have to make the factory health and safety compliant and fit for purpose for the st Century.”Charlie is also hopeful that they will be able to create a learning facility.He said: “Thousands of visitors tour the factory every year – from pensioners to pre-schoolers.“Around  school children visit the factory each year, with the same number of adults too.“We want to create an educational facility where they learn about the factory before touring the site.”The workers who power the factory will, however, remain at its beating heart and will be involved in the refurbishment and move.“We have records for more than  servicemen and women who have worked here,” said Charlie. “Since , we’ve had in excess of  workers.“The factory exists to provide employment for ex service personnel who may otherwise struggle to find employment.“They work year round to ensure that enough poppies are created for the Poppy Appeal and for the many wreaths laid at ceremonies across the country.“The move to Redford Barracks will undoubtedly be challenging.“But we’ve got a plan and some very good people here so we’re confident we’ll do it and still be able to create all the poppies for .“The fact we don’t have a modern production line is something we cherish.

Danny Renowdenfeels at home at the factory, where he has worked part time since Decemver . He hopes, in future, toto college to become a counsellor and help other veterans who find themselves in his position. Previously housing a printing press, it somehow feels like home – not least because we are warmly welcomed like old friends.It’s a special year for the veterans, marking  years since the end of World War One and the creation of a unique anniversary poppy.But the pressure is largely off when we visit as the majority of the five million or so poppies created for this year’s appeal have already been despatched.Work continues apace, though, as staff finish off wreath orders which will be laid at ceremonies theand breadth of the country.The team are, however, more than happy to give us a tour and tell us about their own experiences.David Adamson is our very informative tour guide.The -year-old, who was in the army for  years and thereafter the police for , has worked at the factory for the last seven years.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"At the helm...Charlie Pelling, manager of Lady Haigs Poppy Factory in Edinburgh, is preparing for a temporary move to Redford Barracks, which will start on November . \"  \"  Armistice : Lady Haig Poppy Factory is on the move viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"He said: “I finished with the police on the Saturday and started working here on the Monday and have been here ever since.“I’m now one of the official tour guides and I thoroughly enjoy it.“It’s been fascinating for me finding out about the history of the poppy and what it means to people.“Most of the stuff up on the walls has been presented to us by visitors and military organisations.“Around  school kids also visit every year and they love every minute of it.“It can be like herding cats at times but they always ask really interesting questions and we’re often surprised by the knowledge they have.“We show them how to make the poppies and tell them that our numbers are on the back of each box sold.“Soyou ever see school children looking at the back of the box, they’re looking for our numbers – mine is .”On a whistletop tour, we discover how the poppies are printed and cut out on  year old printing presses – left in the building when the Lady Haig Poppy Factory relocated from the grounds of Whitefoord House in  to the city’s Warriston Road.Lapel poppies may no longer be cut by hand but each one is still handcrafted.The paper from which the poppies is made arrives into the factory in large rolls.These are passed through the cutting and pressing machine and the poppy petals cut to size.Then the team add the distinctive ribbing which makes the Scottish poppy unique, before they start assembling them.Around one million stick on poppies and four million green stem poppies are produced each year.And visitors are always given a chance to make their own which school children, in particular, love, as testied by the many letters and posters on the walls.David, who has three children and seven grandchildren, added: “The bairns lap this place up.“They love making the poppies then they go back to school, do a project and send in posters or letters for our walls. We’ve not got a lot of space but we try to display as many as we can.“Instilling a sense of pride in the poppy in future generations is one of the things I love most about working here.”David and his colleagues also display personal mementoes, some of which serve to remind them of just how much their work means.Thomas McPhillipswas a Royal Corps of Signals radio operator in the s.His grandfather, William Anthony, a Lance Corporal with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, died at Passchendaele on July , .And a picture of his cousin’s son, Gary O’Donnell from South Queensferry, now also takes pride of place on his desk.He explained: “Gary was killed trying to defuse a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan in September  he was only .“In  he was awarded the George Medal for bravery demonstrated in Iraq. “He was awarded another George Medal postumously in March . He is one of the few soldiers to receive two.“I keep Gary’s picture on my desk, just in case my head ever goes down a bit.“That rarely happens here, though. It’s a lovely place to work. “I’ve been here for  years and it’s just like being back in the barracks. I love it.”One of the youngest recruits, Danny Renowden joined the army when he was just  years old.He served for seven years, including a tour in Afghanistan in  which later resulted in his medical discharge in January  due to post traumatic stress disorder .The -year-old initially applied for a job with PoppyScotland which put him in touch with the Poppy Factory.He said: “I emailed in my CV and, within a matter of minutes, Charlie Pelling, the factory manager, replied asking me to come in.“He offered me a job right away. I’ve been here, part-time, since December .”It’s the perfect fit for Danny who, for health reasons, wanted to ease back into employment.He said: “It’s giving me the routine that I really needed but in a workplace that feels like second nature.“Everyone has been in the military so that camaraderie is already there.“They are a great bunch eventhey do like winding me up because I’m originally from Cornwall!”The factory’s flexibility is ideal for dad-of-one Danny who hopes, in future, to help veterans who find themselves in his position.He added: “I’d like to go into counselling veterans but I need to go back to college.“I joined up when I was  and only have my high school education. So I’m looking into doing part-time or night classes, while working here.“For me, the factory has given me back some of the confidence I needed to consider a new career. There’s no pressure or stress andyou’re having a bad day, that’s fine. It’s allowed.”For more information on the poppy factory’s work and products, visit the website at www.ladyhaigspoppyfactory.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"armistice 100 poppyscotland s 1918 poppy

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmIn a final act of remembrance here in Orkney today, at .pm tonight, Sunday, Ola Thomson of the Salvation Army, standing in front of St Magnus Cathedral, joined  inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic Last Post.

Will the Chief Secretary work with the Secretary of State for Business to develop that proposal and work with the Business Department and the developers to see the fruition of what could be a very important part of the Government’s industrial strategy.”Responding to Mr Carmichael, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt. Hon. Liz Truss MP, said: “As part of the spending review we will be looking at the most efficient way we can achieve our carbon targets, and I am working closely with the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy to do.”Commenting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The Minister’s response will do little to assure the industry that they are a priority for the Government. There was nothing in the Budget for this industry, and the Government have been working closely across departments for some time now. It is disappointing that little progress appears to be being made.“Wave and tidal power generation and new and innovative forms of producing green energy. The ambition of the industry however has not been matched by the policy framework, which continues to prevent this sector from reaching the point where it becomes commercially viable.“Renewable energy generation, particularly wave and tidal stream power are areas at which the Northern Isles is at the very forefront, and the creation of these Innovative Power Purchase Agreements would make great strides towards helping these innovative industries continue to flourish. The Minister should stop dragging her feet and start delivering for the industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we continue to turn a blind eye to the risk of developing type  diabetes as a result, we can only expect to see the number of undiagnosed cases escalate.‘Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness among people of working age in the UK so it’s hugely important that diabetes is detected early and monitored correctly to avoid furthering the risks.‘At Specsavers, we offer digital retinal photography. This takes a detailed picture of the back of your eye and the microcirculation of blood – helping to highlight indicators of diabetes that need addressing.Eye screening is also a key part of your diabetes care and people with diabetes should have routine screenings done every one to two years by an optometrist. Contact your local GP or local diabetic screening service for more information.Sophie Castell, Director of Relationships at RNIB, says: ‘Sadly, all too often, people with diabetes can lose their sight due to complications. Yet with early detection and treatment, sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy can be prevented. Regular eye tests are important for everyone, but especially for people living with diabetes who should also ensure they attend appointments for specialist diabetic eye screening. It’s a few minutes that could save your sight.’ https:www.diabetes.org.uk resources-s - diabetes_in_the_uk_.pdf https:www.diabetes.org.uk about_us news over--of-people-unaware-diabetes-can-lead-to-blindness- State of the Nation’s Eye Health, Specsavers  RNIB  https:www.rnib.org.uk knowledge-and-research-hub-research-reports prevention-sight-loss stateofthenation http:www.rnib.org.uk sites default files RNIB_evidence_based_review_of_working_age_people.pdf vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget. We have managed to do this without compulsory redundancies and at the same time have still invested in important projects across the Highlands ndash such as new schools, roads and free wi-fi.\"A major concern is the councilrsquos financial reserves which are at their \"lowest levels in recent history\" requiring immediate action.\"We were estimating a pound million overspend in quarter one ndash but our officers have been working extremely hard to reduce this and we are now predicting a more positive out-turn with an overspend of pound. million,\" Cllr Mackinnon said. \"This is not ideal, but moving in the right direction. We do however have the risk of the cost of another harsh winter ahead of us.\"The council is now focusing on income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies to protect essential services.Cllr Mackinnon added: \"There will be very hard decisions to make as we plan for a reduced budget over the next three years and it is vital that we involve the public, our staff and all members in the choices we make.\"Depute budget leader councillor Matthew Reiss said: \"This is an opportunity to listen to what is important to people, to reshape our priorities and to focus our resources on improving lives.\"I strongly encourage everyone to get involved in this and make your voices heard.

If it wasn’t for his actions and calm approach in knowing what to do, it could have been a very dferent ending.“I literally owe my le to him and he will always be my hero.”Since the incident in April , Cayden has gone on to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation , which he undertook at a free Save a Le for Scotland partnership event at Glasgow LIVE!, and has also been shortlisted in this year’s St Andrew’s First Aid Scottish First Aid Awards.He is urging people across the country to sign the \u2028petition, which has been lodged with the Scottish Parliament and is open until  December.Cayden said: “With mum’s condition, it is really important to me to know what to dosomething happens to her. “I feel a lot more confident having the first aid skills that I have learned.“It would be greatother children had the opportunity to learn first aid too, so that they could help other people or members of their family, should they ever need it,” he added.The petition is open until  December,  and can be found on the Scottish Parliament website at: http:www.parliament.scot GettingInvolved Petitions firstaidprimaryschoolsStuart Callison, chief executive of St Andrew’s First Aid, said: “Cayden is a shining example of how very young children have the capacity and ability to learn – and deliver – first aid.“Whilst any incident when it happens can feel overwhelming, children who are equipped with even basic first aid knowledge have time and time again demonstrated that they can make a real dference and potentially save someone’s le.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827929.1542015642!/image/image.jpg","title":"wind turbines generating 98 of electricity demand","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Wind turbines generated the equivalent of  per cent of all Scotland#s electricity demand in October, according to new analysis.WWF Scotland said that National Grid demand for the month was ,, MWh and that almost all of this could have been provided by wind turbines, which provided record levels of power.Turbines generated the equivalent of  per cent of all Scotland’s electricity demand or enough to power nearly five million homes last month, the group said.The best day was  October when turbines generated ,.

He’s about to get on a plane but the worn white Fender Stratocaster with the maple fingerboard, on which he wrote best selling hits with his band Chic and produced some of the biggest-selling albums of all time with David Bowie, Madonna and Diana Ross, won’t be shoved in the hold. The Hitmaker, as he calls it, and which is integral to his funky ‘chucking’ style, won’t be out of his sight. He left it on a train once, luckily got it back, but yes, he did freak out...The Grammy Award-winning musician, composer, arranger, guitarist and co-founder of Chic says, “I have a replica, and a plexiglass one and they sound really great live and on record, real close, but it’s not the same.” Rodgers is about to fly out of Toronto when we speak, heading for London in his trademark dreadlocks and beret to put the funk into the X Factor, replacing the touring Robbie Williams as a judge. He’s also collecting a humanitarian award from the Global Gt charity for his work with his We Are Family Foundation, named for his Sister Sledge anthem. Career-wise he’s flying high too, after releasing the first Chic album for more than two decades this summer featuring Elton John, Emeli Sandé and Lady Gaga, with another album due out in February and about to kick off a -date European and UK tour with the band that’ll make Glasgow Dance, Dance, Dance in December. He’s the newly elected Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and as the recently-appointed inaugural Chief Creative Advisor for Abbey Road Studios, it’s time to celebrate Good Times. Rodgers is responsible for decades of floorfillers, after starting out as a musician on Sesame Street, playing clubs and bars before co-founding Chic in  with bassist Bernard Edwards. There were Chic disco hits: Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance, I Want Your Love, Le Freak and Good Times, and hits he produced for others: He’s The Greatest Dancer, We Are Family, , I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, , Like A Virgin, , Let’s Dance . Then there are his collaborations, with Daft Punk on the Random Access Memories album and single Get Lucky, global hits that won him three Grammys, with Avicii, Sigala Disclosure and Sam Smith, plus the genre crossing talent that saw Good Times spark the advent of hip-hop when it was picked up as the base for Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight. In all, his work has sold more than  million albums and  million singles, but it’s been  years since Nile Rodgers and Chic released a studio album. Hence the title It’s About Time. “Yes,” he laughs. “For one thing there’s the obvious – it was about time I did this stuff and got it back out.” It would have been earlier, but as Rodgers was working on the album the deaths of his friends and previous collaborators Prince, David Bowie, George Michael and Chris Cornell hit him hard. “What happened was I had got a large tape drop from Warner Brothers of masters that I thought were gone for ever and that made me feel so happy and nostalgic and I was about to release an album. But then people started passing away that I had written tribute songs about, and it made me feel like I’d be capitalising on Bowie and Prince’s passing, and it was just so wrong.”The time is right now, however, and at , Rodgers has been thinking about mortality. He’s beaten prostate cancer once in  and last year had a lump removed from his kidney. Today he declares himself fit and healthy,a little tired from last night’s Toronto gig, but he’s determined to fulfil his mission to get everyone dancing to feelgood music.“I know that our time on this planet is finite,” he says “and you know what, I want to spend the rest of my le making really great dance music. When I was producing Eric Clapton one day he came out of the studio and said to me that he was gonna play blues for the rest of his le. I said ‘Eric, you mean to tell meI come see a Clapton show I’m not gonna hear Sunshine of Your Love  Or any of those Cream and Blind Faith cool songs ’ And he said ‘no, you’re not gonna get that again, because I’m not going to play it again.’ I went home and thought about it for a bit and I said, ‘well, hell,Eric Clapton is gonna play blues for the rest of his le, I’m gonna play dance music for the rest of my le. Right! I just wanna play music for ever.“Not that I think I’m Eric Clapton, but you know,you’ve put in all this time, you have the right to decide what you want to do and I decided that I like to make music that makes people happy, makes people want to dance. It really feels good to me to see people express themselves through motion.”Speaking of dancing, as a legendary exponent of dance music, what does Rodgers consider to be his hottest move  How would he wow one night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco  Rumba and Tango, Latin Hustle, too, Yowsah, Yowsah… “I have no idea,” he says and laughs. “I don’t consider myself a good dancer any more, because I was actually a serious dancer. I was actually a ballet dancer in another le. Not many people know that, but it’s true. Around the time I was working with Sesame Street when I was  or , and I took it very seriously for a while. Then I just started gigging a lot more and I didn’t have time to practise and ballet you gotta practise just as seriously as you practise music.” As for the upcoming tour, Chic fans can expect to hear the old favourites alongside some of the new album because Rodgers knows his crowd and after playing the festival circuit with Glastonbury and Coachella last year, he’s also conscious a lot of the audience will be hearing them for the first time. “At our shows I ask people to raise their handsthey’re seeing Chic for the first time, and we’re averaging about  per cent first timers. This is amazing to me! Especially since we’ve played the UK so much. I’m like Jesus, everybody has seen us! But no, more than half the crowd will raise their hands and that’s cool.”Rodgers may have four decades in the business but he’s still an innovator and already at Abbey Road has been the first to shoot a video there and has more plans to move and shake the legendary studio.“Abbey Road’s amazing,” he says. “They’re allowing me to do everything there, matter of fact, ha! I might re-invigorate my ballet career, have a dance recital there! It’s just incredible. It’s probably one of the most artistic, creative environments I’ve ever been in. I’m making films, doing concerts, even Paul McCartney wound up having a concert there after I came.”Born in New York in  Rodgers didn’t have the easiest start in le. His mother was  when she got pregnant with him and his biological father, Nile Rodgers Senior, a travelling percussionist, moved on. With his mother and step-father both being heroin addicts, Rodgers learned young to be self-reliant. The last time I interviewed him he spoke about how once as a five-year-old he got wedged down the back of the sofa when his parents were out of it and he had to wait for his grandmother to come round to the house and retrieve him. If he could, what would he say to that little boy stuck amid soft furnishings, waiting for someone to realise he was missing  “I’d say, buckle up, it’s going to be a hell of a ride!” He laughs. After learning to play the guitar at  Rodgers figured he could pay rent and landed his first professional job in the Sesame Street band at . But despite their struggles, he’s very close to his family, especially his mother, and is grateful for the legacy of music bequeathed him by his parents. It’s in his bones and has been all his le.“I have music in me, around me, it just swirls in my head all the time. I can’t turn it off as a matter of fact. Oh yeah, I always hear music, all day long. I heard it as a child, and I hear it now,” he says. In was almost inevitable he would make his name in music, from the beginning playing and practising every day. “I wish I could do that now,” he says, “I would give my left arm to be able to do that. Oh, no… you know what I mean.” He laughs. “I just think practising makes me play better, and he quotes the violinist Jascha Heetz, who once said ‘ I don’t practise one day, I know it two days, the critics know it three days, the public knows it.’ His insecure formative years necessitated a work ethic that spurred Rodgers on and brought financial rewards such as the house by the shore in Westport, Connecticut, with the boat moored at the jetty, where he lives today. Apparently alone, but then Rodgers never talks about his relationships. “Yeah, I’m pretty discreet,” he says. And just out of nosiness, because he’s ulged this to me before, and he is the child of a pair of beatnik hippies, does he still like to hang out there naked when he doesn’t have guests  He laughs. “Yeah, of course, why would I change  Old dog new tricks  No.” With his colourful le story, Nile Rodgers The Musical, should be worth the wait, but his much anticipated autobiographical show is still being written and may be another couple of years in the pipeline. Right now he’s got his hands full with the musical he wrote with Jean-Paul Gaultier, entitled Fashion Freak Show, currently wowing the Folies Bergeres in Paris, as well as another musical bound for Las Vegas and provisionally London’s West End. “The Paris show is doing great and the other one is loosely based on disco lestyle stuff and it’s being done by [Steven Hoggett] the choreographer from the Harry Potter show that’s in the West End now.”As to who would play Rodgers in the musical of his le, he’s at a complete loss, sounding surprised at the question.“Oh, I don’t know… I wouldn’t even… I don’t even know,” he says. “That person would have to be a hell of a lot more talented than myself, because they’d have to do a lot of things at an early age that I couldn’t do when I was that age!” He laughs.Compose, perform, produce, act, oh and they’d have to add ballet to the long list of talents now too, know their ballottéfrom their boogie. “Yes, they would.” He laughs. And no, he wouldn’t consider playing himself.Today Rodgers’ mother Beverly has Alzheimer’s, but the two find common love in music and when he visited her last week, as usual they revisited their playlist for le.“She loves everything. My mom is a be-bop junkie... and loves everything from Charlie Mingus to Nina Simone to Miles to The Beatles. The other day we were singing Hey Jude and she knows every single word, even sings the ad libs…” He lts his voice and does his mother doing McCartney’s scat, “Ju-Judy Judy Judy Judy Judy.“She’s amazing.”Rodgers’ own playlist of signicant songs would contain primarily jazz and some of his own tracks, not out of narcissism, but because he rarely gets to hear them. “I only hear my music when I’m playing it and there’s a huge dference between the recorded and performance versions. In performance there’s a lot of improvisation whereas recorded is exactly the same every time. Sometime when I hear the recorded version I go ‘oh my god, I forgot I wrote that part too’. The other day I heard Let’s Dance and forgot how intricate the horn voicings were. I listened to the whole album and thought wow, this is cool.“Let’s Dance was part of Rodgers’ reinvention as a producer, the album that turned his career around after punk kicked in and left disco apparently for dead. Boogie was busted as punk gobbed in its face and Chic, with their soul, RB, funk, glitter and groove were out in the cold. “Durin’ the disco sucks era,” he says, “we couldn’t get anything, no buzz, no one would listen to us. We were just persona non grata. It’s not that the music was bad, it was just we were not flavour of the month. People didn’t like us.”The collaboration with Bowie was to reinvigorate his career and satisfy his love for discovering new sounds. “Up until David’s record I had six failures in a row. I was known for producing disco. But after David I probably had six successes in a row: David Bowie, INXS, Duran Duran, Madonna, then Duran Duran again, then Mick Jagger and David Bowie with Dancing in the Street... yeah I had a clutch.“And collaborating is fun! Not only have you got your own energy to vibe off, but you have other people’s. I love being in Chic but for the last  years I’ve been mainly in the room with brand new people, in other people’s bands.” Looking back over his career Rodgers is hard pushed to nominate an event or song of which he is most proud. “I’m not more proud of Let’s Dance than We Are Family, Get Lucky, I Want Your Love, Dance, Dance, Dance, Everybody Dance or Rapper’s Delight.”As he lists the titles, it prompts a muscle memory, the beginnings of a hustle in the hips, a shimmy in the shoulders, so perhaps it’s the longevity of his sound that’s most impressive. Rodgers, however, can’t explain his success. “If I knew the answer to that question, don’t you think every record I’ve put out would be a hit ” he says. “Most of my records are not hits. Most of my records are flops. Only a handful are hits. Well, actually, a big handful....”A very big handful...“Well, yeah, anyway...” he trails off, modest and mellow.Holding his Hitmaker, it’s time for Rodgers to board his flight, with a final word about how much he’s looking forward to the tour. “You know, I really love composing, I love making records, and when we know from the charts that people are listening, there is a joy that we get. “But when you can actually see people having a good time, that feels pretty damn good. There’s nothing like that. It’s wonderful. So... see you in Glasgow for Good Times.” @JanetChristieNile Rodgers  Chic kick off their UK arena tour at The SSE Hydro Glasgow on  December.

This column has not shirked from apportioning blame for the appalling negotiations on the UK’s poor strategy, tactics and communications. Nevertheless, the EU had an ally in Theresa May, a Remainer who, together with the British civil service and most especially HM Treasury, could be relied upon to see Brussels’ point of view on most issues. She foolishly adopted the EU’s timescale andagenda she has conceded ECJ jurisdiction in many areas when she said there would be none using Orwellian newspeak she has rebranded the Single Market as adopting “a common rule book for goods and agri-foods” and called the Customs Union a “UK-wide backstop” so we might stay in both without an exit.Yet in December the EU humbled her over the withdrawal agreement by imposing a wholly unnecessary Irish backstop that she should have resisted, and having learned from that humiliating capitulation they now seek further concessions. Media reports suggest Brussels has torpedoed the latest iation of her Chequers-Minus Plan and are insisting that EU boats must continue to have access to the British fisheries after we have left the Common Fisheries Policy.Whatever plan May is able to have accepted by the EU is only likely to get through parliament with the support of the Labour Party, but Corbyn and McDonnell would far rather reject it in the belief defeat would force her to go to the country and they might achieve a change in government.Indeed, there are strong rumours circulating that the Conservative Party is being readied for a general election to offer the nation the PM’s “deal” or face a Corbyn government. I believe this is an empty threat designed to instil discipline in the ranks – for Tory MPs would have to approve a general election and these turkeys are not likely to vote for Christmas. More likely would be a leadership challenge and change of Prime Minister.The mood in the House of Commons is febrile. The resignation of the Transport Minister, Jo Johnson, the Remain-supporting younger brother of Boris Johnson, only served to confirm how Theresa May has failed to satisfy any of the competing groups within the Conservative Party. What then can be done, what alternatives are there • : Theresa May warned of Commons Brexit defeat as eurosceptic Tories and DUP forge allianceThe MP Nick Boles is pushing the idea that the UK should take up Norway’s arrangement by confirming membership of the European Economic Area so the UK is temporarily in the EU Single Market but outside the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agriculture Policy. We would then use that position to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU and then leave the EEA. This arrangement without a time limit would come at a price, however there would be an annual transfer of funds to the EU running into billions, we would have next to no say in the rules our businesses would have to adopt, the European Court of Justice would still have signicant jurisdiction over the UK and, troubling to many people, we would have to accept freedom of movement. It is an arrangement not without criticism in Norway – especially from left-of-centre, for it was designed as a means to take Norway fully into the EU, not for nations seeking to leave. More importantly, the Norwegian prime minister has been as diplomatically polite as possible in pointing out that having a country join the EEA that only wishes to leave is not especially attractive. In truth we’re not wanted.There is of course the proposal for having a second referendum, given support by Jo Johnson when he resigned and backed by Nick Clegg, Paddy Ashdown, John Major, Alastair Campbell and other notables including Nicola Sturgeon. What they all have in common is having advocated remaining in the EU and sworn, indeed warned, there would be only one vote, no matter which way we voted – they have gone back on their word. In the  general election the Liberal Democrats advocated an In-Out EU referendum but dropped the idea when they went into coalition by  they opposed a referendum, and when it happened they insisted it would be respected. Having lost it they want a re-run of the referendum they tried to stop.A second referendum does not solve the UK’s problems it is not clearit should be on membership or on a deal – or both – and is complicated further because continued UK membership will not be under the current terms. We will lose our financial rebate worth billions, we shall be forced to accept immigrant quotas and once more be on the hook for Euro bail-outs that loom over the Eurozone economy. The EU army that two years ago was called a “myth” has become a reality, with President Macron saying it might even have to defend us against the United States. With May’s “Chequers-minus-minus” likely to mean remaining in her rebranded Customs Union, Single Market and Common Fisheries Policy a Norway-style deal where we would continue to be rule takers at a heavy price a second referendum continuing to ide the country and lead to demands for a third-time-luckyLeavers lostthe only alternative must be to live under World Trade Organisation rules that give us time to negotiate the trade deal that is already on the table for Great Britain, but not yet Northern Ireland.With that in mind, Jacob Rees Mogg has come forward with a plan called “No Deal – Plus” which would mean spending time between now and the end of March on ironing out what problems might exist but sweetening the EU with an offer of two years’ net payments of £bn.His case is that much of the scaremongering can be dealt with by tying up similar administrative arrangements that already exist for other countries living under WTO rules.

On Saturday, the American President – before failing to turn up at a US military cemetery in France because it was raining – told his  million Twitter followers he was in Paris to “celebrate the end of World War One” and asked: “Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war ”Mr Trump’s dependably vulgar intervention stood in stark contrast to the tone of events held around the world to mark the centenary of Armistice Day.Tempting though it is to simply ignore the President’s contribution, it stands as a useful reminder of the importance of the values we cherish as we remember those who fell in the Great War and in many subsequent conflicts. As we think of their courage, their loyalty, their comradeship, and their sacrice, we are reminded that – no matter how determined Mr Trump and others who travel his path may be to debase opponents and ide people – these are values we should hold closer than ever.After the laying of wreaths by, among others, Prince Charles, Prime Minister Theresa May, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, , members of the public, descended from services personnel, marched past the Cenotaph in London in what was described by organisers as a “nation’s thank you”.• : Silhouettes of First World War Tommies projected on to Edinburgh CastleThis simple, silent procession of those who carry with them something of those lost in battle was powerfully moving. So, too, was an event in Folkestone where the film director Danny Boyle oversaw the etching on the beach by a team of artists of a portrait of the poet Wilfred Owen. Owen – who was killed a week before the end of the First World War – had left for France from the beach on which his image was recreated. Yesterday, as millions around the world fell silent at am, the tide crept across the poet’s image, slowly washing it away. It was an elegant visual poem, a reminder of the fragility of le.The events of the weekend do not, of course, direct our thoughts solely to those who lost their lives in battle, they also make us think about the circumstances that led to conflict. As we remember those who died, we also examine the mistakes of the past that created the catalysts for war. Commemoration of the fallen without a commitment to ensure that others are not, wherever possible, called upon to make the same sacrice would be meaningless.One hundred years after the last body fell during the First World War, young men and women continue to risk their lives in the service of this nation and many of those people will, in time, need our support. The impact of war on service personnel is far better understood than it once was. Many men executed as cowards or deserters between - would, today, be recognised as sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder.And so we were encouraged to hear a suggestion from opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn for a new “social contract for veterans”. Mr Corbyn said that, under his plan, those leaving the forces would be guaranteed a home, mental health support, and opportunities in education and employment.It is abundantly clear that many ex-services personnel require a great deal more support than they now receive Mr Corbyn’s suggestion is one to which the government should give serious consideration.We remembered, yesterday, those who gave their lives in service of the UK but those people are gone now and we can offer them only our thoughts. A truly fitting memorial to those who fell would be our commitment to properly support those who follow in their footsteps.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4828014.1542012458!/image/image.jpg","title":"michel barnier to update eu ministers on brexit negotiations as pressure builds on may","story":"Michel Barnier will update ministers from European Union nations on the state of the Brexit negotiations as domestic pressure on Theresa May intensies.Boris Johnson claimed Mrs May is on the brink of “total surrender” to the EU over Brexit as he urged the Cabinet to mutiny against the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agenda.And another Brexiteer former cabinet minister, John Whittingdale, said it was dficult to see how Mrs May’s premiership could continueMPs rejected any Brexit deal she brought back to Parliament.Pro-Brexit Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom added to Tory tensions by insisting the UK could not be “trapped” in a backstop agreement without the ability to leave at a time of its choosing.Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson suggested thatMrs May’s plans for a backstop customs deal with the EU - aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - went through, the UK could be reduced to the status of a colony.In a stinging attack on the PM’s proposals ahead of a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said Mrs May’s agenda would see the UK “remain in captivity”.Mr Johnson said plans for a backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union with the EUa solution to the Irish border issue could not be found, would be worse than remaining in the EU.Mrs May is under fire from both wings of the Tory party after the shock resignation from the Government of Mr Johnson’s pro-European brother Jo, who also delivered a withering attack on the PM’s stance.That move fired speculation that more ministers who backed Remain in the referendum campaign could also quit.Boris Johnson resigned following the Cabinet session on Brexit at Chequers in July and further details of that crunch meeting revealed Remain-leaning ministers also voiced concerns.Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Chancellor Philip Hammond raised concerns about the Chequers plan, the BBC reported.Mr Javid described the proposal for a common rule book with the EU for goods and agriculture as “very worrying”, while Mr Hammond questioned whether the  other countries in the union would accept such a plan, the broadcaster said.Writing in the Daily , Mr Johnson said that eventhe Government got the EU to agree to giving London a unilateral exit option from the backstop, it would be meaningless.“The awful truth is that eventhe Cabinet mutinies - as they ought - it will make little dference.“Evenwe agree with the EU that the UK must have a unilateral break clause, so that we can go our own sweet way at a time of our own choosing, it is irrelevant because the programme and ambition of the Government is to remain in captivity, to stay in our cell, evenwe are given the theoretical key to escape.”Former culture secretary Mr Whittingdale said Mrs May would have to goshe could not get a Brexit deal through the Commons.He told BBC Radio ’s The Westminster Hour: “I thinkthe Prime Minister’s Brexit plan doesn’t get through Parliament, I think it’s quite dficult to see how the Prime Minister can continue because she has staked her credibility.”Remain-supporting former education secretary Justine Greening said she did not think the Chequers plan would get through a “gridlocked” Parliament.“We should be planning as to how we can put this final say on Brexit in the hands of the British people,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today.Hope of getting a deal for the Cabinet to sign off on Tuesday appeared to be rapidly receding, but talks are continuing in Brussels.The apparent impasse makes it much harder for the PM to secure a special EU conference in November to settle Brexit terms.But in a sign of Downing Street attempting to push the process forward, Mrs May’s key Brexit adviser Olly Robbins held talks with counterparts in Brussels over the weekend.Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, will address ministers from the  remaining EU nations at a general affairs council meeting in Brussels on Monday. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4828009.1542010458!/image/image.jpg","title":"rbs paid contractors 400 to stuff envelopes","story":"Royal Bank of Scotland paid contractors a staggering # a day to stuff envelopes, wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayers# money in the process, it can be revealed.The Press Association has learned that the lender, still % owned by the Government, paid iniduals £ day plus VAT to carry out mundane tasks such as sending PPI letters to customers.The hefty sums were paid during certain periods in  and this year at an office in Manchester.Those working on the project told PA that they were originally hired to work as specialists, but were then told to put letters in envelopes because of management disorganisation.“It is purely because they have no organisational skills on the project we were on and was a complete waste of taxpayers’ money,” said one contractor who worked on the project, speaking on condition of anonymity.Typical envelope-stuffing jobs are paid at the minimum wage, meaning taxpayers have lost out to the tune of thousands of pounds, although the exact figure is unknown as RBS has not disclosed the total number of people receiving the bumper pay rate.The damning revelations will come as a major embarrassment to RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, who has pledged to cut costs at the lender and stamp out scandals under his watch.In its defence of the bumper wage, RBS said in a statement: “We do not hire contractors at this rate to do this type of work. When we employ contractors, they are paid in line with industry rates according to their experience and skills.“There have been a limited number of occasions when we have used short-term support from other areas of our business to ensure we are delivering on time and in line with our commitments for our customers.”Since the financial crisis, RBS has been dogged by furore surrounding the mis-selling of payment protection insurance , mortgage-backed securities and the mistreatment of small businesses.In addition, Mr McEwan has taken an axe to the RBS branch network as part of cost-cutting measures, resulting in hundreds of job losses.RBS has made more than £ billion of losses since it was handed a £ billion state bailout at the height of the financial crisis in . ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Monday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

Celtic or Gaelic departments at other universities to take a year out and study Gaelic in an immersive environment. From Dunbar, Izzy has always had a keen interest in languages and studies French and Gaelic at Glasgow University. She was given a place on a course for fluent Gaelic speakers at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, and quickly established herself as a popular and supportive member of the young Gaelic community.”It was only in her final year in James Gillespies High School that she got the opportunity to learn Gaelic.Izzy said: #It’s a great honour to have been awarded an award that’s so well renowned. I feel very lucky to have become a part of the Gaelic community both here at the Mod and beyond.”Elsewhere at the Mòd on Wednesday, the top singing prizes for Gaelic learners both headed to the far north of Scotland.The Silver Pendant for women was won by Eileen Duncan from Tongue, Sutherland while Mikie MacEanrig from Keiss in Caithness too the men’s award."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ARMADALE-FERRY-LORD-OF-THE-ISLES-3.jpg","title":"armadale mallaig crossing among most popular routes in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Armadale to Mallaig crossing is among the most popular ferry routes in Scotland according to new figures obtained by Kate Forbes MSP.According to  statistics, Ardrossan to Brodick had the highest number of passengers with ,, followed by Largs to Millport , Wemyss Bay to Rothesay , Oban to Craignureand Mallaig to Armadale .Skye, Lochaber and, Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes said she was surprised that Mallaig to Armadale crossing proved more popular than Ullapool to Stornoway .The statistics also showed that the Skye to Mallaig route was the most popular crossing for coaches across Scotland.Kate Forbes MSP said: “Since RET was introduced by the SNP Government, it’s great to see the rise in passengers.“RET is vitally important to the islands and has arguably done more than anything  to level the playing field for island communities who need to travel.“Mallaig to Armadale figures were up by  per cent compared to the fateful summer of . Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

The desire to produce the right deal can be superseded by the perceived need to produce a deal.This is why all negotiations need measures to prevent this, a check mechanism and preferably multiple ones.With the current UK-EU negotiations, there are two identiable check mechanisms or lines of defence to concluding an unwise agreement - Cabinet and Parliament.Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister outlining broad concerns about the direction of travel.This could be discerned from shts in public comments, private engagements and what was being briefed in London, Dublin and Brussels. I wrote in the hope of reassurance and with the desire that an acceptable deal for us all was within grasp. Instead, I received confirmation that we were right to be concerned.If what is outlined in the reply is the type of deal the Prime Minister intends to conclude, then the DUP could not support a deal which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.Indeed, many others in Westminster and throughout the United Kingdom, true to their commitments to respect the referendum, the national interest and to the Union, have contacted me to voice their concern.Equally we cannot be assured that this current proposal will be the final deal. The European Union price for agreement appears to rise daily whether it be our fishing industry or an ever growing list of level playing field commitments.Last December when this backstop appeared we were deeply concerned. This is why we sought and got the paragraph  assurance of a democratic protection against a sea border.In March, the EU made clear its intention to ignore paragraph  and rewrite paragraph . We took no solace from our predictions being correct but we did take solace that it was universally rejected.Neither the passage of time nor the application of pressure has made it any more acceptable now.The new idea of a UK customs arrangement does not appear to be a genuinely UK-wide offer but a GB offer and an NI offer badged as one - Northern Ireland in THE EU customs territory and GB in A customs union.The real intent is not to solve any land border issues in Ireland but to handcuff the UK to the EU, with the EU holding the keys. The United Kingdom would be trapped.The focus on customs arrangements should never blind anyone to a sea border of regulations.We certainly did not forget it and why we raised it repeatedly and consistently.It was something the Prime Minister ruled out after Salzburg: \"…no new regulatory barriers should be created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK unless the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree.\"The limited and low level checks that exist at the moment in Belfast and Larne do not compare to what wo uld be the future arrangement.Key industries in Northern Ireland would be subject to rules and standards with no democratic input to them. Rules would be made in Brussels rather than Stormont or Westminster.The regulatory sea border with some caveats in the Prime Ministers letter is still a sea border.This is not haggling about checks but preventing Northern Ireland from being left in the EU with the Northern Ireland Assembly reduced to vassal status or the devolution settlement torn up.Our most important trade flows are to be hampered and regulated by the EU. Despite all of this a Northern Ireland specic backstop still remains.The Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson has rightly warned: \"…Northern Ireland would erge unconsciously from the United Kingdom against the expressed will of its people - it would also feed Scottish nationalist demands that a similar ergent arrangement be made for Scotland.\"The DUP does not stand alone against this proposal. We appreciate the support from MPs across the United Kingdom.We are ready to stand with those in Cabinet and in Parliament to work for a better deal. One which works for the whole United Kingdom. We want the referendum result to be respected and the entire United Kingdom to leave together with a sensible deal.Arlene Foster is leader of the DUP"},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham bomb campaigner i chose not to have children because of maxine the thought of losing a child im not strong enough for that","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the biggest mass murder in England in the th century. And it was followed by one of the centurys greatest miscarriages of justice. Six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were tried and convicted of the crime in . They did not walk free until .For years, Julie Hambleton , sister of murdered -year-old Maxine Hambleton, has fought for answers to the question - who did bomb Birmingham Indefatigable, brave and determined, Julie and her brother Brian founded and spearhead the group Justice For The .Here, Julie, a university lecturer, tells why she believes the authorities do not want the truth to come out.She describes the obstacles they have faced in the complex legal battle that has been central to their search for justice .And, in heart-rending and deeply personal words, she describes how the death of her beloved big sister has impacted upon, and shaped, her own le.\"I chose not to have children because of Maxine. The thought of losing a child... Im not strong enough for that.\"Q. Apart from Maxine, how many other brothers and sisters do you have A. There were six of us in our family, three boys and three girls. Im the youngest. Theres Brian, whos the oldest, then there was Maxine, then Paul, Gary and Jane and then me.My mum and dad were orced. When Maxine was killed theyd been orced for about five or six years. My sister Jane and I lived with our mum, Margaret. Gary lived with the old man and his missus and our half brother.And Maxine, Brian and Paul had just moved into a house together that the old man had bought. Maxine had not long come back from France, grape-picking in the Champagne vineyards. Shed wanted to improve her French for her A-levels.Theyd moved into this house, so she said to Brian and Paul: \"Are you okayI have a housewarming party and invite people around on Friday \" Which was November . I was  at the time and Jane was .We were invited because mum trusted her. Maxine was a chip off the old block from mum. So mum had agreed that we could go, because she knew that wed be looked after. Maxine had gone into town that night to meet her friends.She was very creative. She made all her own clothes. And shed designed her own invitation cards for the housewarming party. So shed gone to meet her friends to hand out the party invites, which had the details of the address of the house, what bus service to catch and so on.She was literally just going in to hand these out when she was killed, with her friend Jane Davis. Our eldest brother Brian had said to her that night: \"If you iron my shirt, Ill give you a lt into town.\"He would have given her a lt anyway. But she ironed his shirt. And so - and he never told us this for years - he dropped her into town and for all these years he carried guilt, because he believed hed taken Maxine to her death.Q. You were only  at the time. Do you remember how you found out Maxine had been killed A. Oh God, yeah. Its like it was yesterday. When the bomb went off there was a newsflash. I was watching television with my mum and my stepfather.I remember when the newsflash came on, my mum saying: \"The b******s.\" I knew that Maxine had gone into town, but I didnt give it a thought. At least I dont recall giving it a thought. The party was going to be the next day and I was excited about that. On the Friday, Jane and I went to school and we were coming home from school, at the top of the road where we lived, at the top of the hill, and I remember our mum coming round the corner with our stepfather in the car.And I was thinking That was unusual. Ill always remember that as they came round the corner mum waved at us and smiled. And that was unusual too. Usually shed being pulling faces... you know... being mum. And I remember that. Because it was not mum. Me and Jane get into the house and mum had gone upstairs.Our stepfather called us into the living room and started drawing the curtains. And again that was odd, because even though it was November it was still light when we got home from school.I remember thinking Why is he closing the curtains  That moment has always stuck with me. Why is he closing the curtains  He sat us down and he said: \"You know that Maxine went into town last night.\" And we said: \"Yes. Is she all right  Is she hurt  Is she all right \" He said: \"Shes not hurt. Shes killed.\"And its almost impossible to try and explain what that does to your head and to your body. I was . Its just impossible to explain. I was looking at some photographs the other day of Maxine when she was about eight and its so hard to look at that. I mean, I have pictures of her all over the house, but its only within the past  years that Ive been able to do that. I couldnt have been able to do that before.But I cant really look at her, I mean really sit there and look at her and think about it for too long, or Id feel like my head was going to explode with all that sadness and grief and anger and the... just the incomprehension of her death.Q. It would have been hard enough to lose your sister at that age. But the cruel way she was murdered, the horror of that, must have made it so much worse.A. There are so many things that make it all the worse. So many levels. There are so many factions to our anger and our grief and the harrowing manestation of it all. Firstly the gutless b*****ds - and you can quote me on that - the gutless b*****ds who planned it, built the bombs, transported the bombs and then planted the bombs and then ran away like the spineless, lily-livered cowards that they are.Because they havent got the backbone or the courage of their convictions to stand their ground and not wear a mask and put their hands up and say: \"I did it. And this is why I did it.\" But not one of them has had the courage of their convictions to do that. So, what does that say about them And on the back of that, the government failed to do anything. The Birmingham Six didnt do it. Theyknew they didnt do it. But they allowed the real murderers to continue to have their liberty and possibly to kill again and possibly again and again. And that is the double whammy that were dealing with - that our own government have done nothing and continue to do nothing to look for those responsible for what was Englands biggest mass murder of the th century.Q. How did your family feel when the Birmingham Six were convicted  You must have thought at that point theyd got the right men.A. I cant answer that question. I was . The police had come to see my mum and we were told it was them, without any shadow of a doubt. And I would imagine the other families were told the same.The government did such a good job smearing them with the propaganda, which is exactly what it was, that its still in lots of peoples minds even today - they believe that the Six did it. Paddy Hill has become one of our staunchest supporters. Meeting Paddy Hill for the first time, that was the hardest thing Ive ever done.Have you seen the documentary Who murdered Maxine  Its on YouTube. In that documentary, you see us, Brian and I, meeting Paddy Hill for the first time. What you dont see is that as we were walking in - its usually Brian who falls apart - but he managed to keep it together and I was the one who fell apart.I was inconsolable. Because I thought I was betraying Maxine and betraying my mother. But Paddy is now one of the staunchest supporters of Justice For The .Q. Who set up the group A. Brian and I set it up together. Another of our supporters came up with the name. With the families of the other victims weve become a community - one big extended family.We are a group of people who love each other and belong to each other. But we are a group of people who would otherwise choose not to be in the group that we are, for obvious reasons.Q. Do you feel the victims have been forgotten A. Yes, they have been forgotten. Where were concerned, and I said this when I was giving evidence to the NI Affairs Select Committee to do with the On The Runs, and I repeat it all the time, the British authorities wish that they could bury us next to our dead.Because we dare raise our heads above the parapet and demand that they fulfil the role that they are employed and paid to do, which is to represent and serve and protect us - those who pay their salaries.Q. Has there been anybody in public le whos come forward to try to help you A. The one whos come closest is Jess Phillips, the MP for Yardley in Birmingham. She has been very pro-active, God bless her.Q. Full inquests into the deaths of the  victims of the Birmingham bombings are to be held in the spring of next year. Central to that, you believe, should be the issue of identying those responsible for the atrocity. So you have concerns, dont you, that a recent Court of Appeal rulinglimits the scope of the inquests  And you are also angry about being denied legal aid...A. We had to go out on to the streets, to prostitute ourselves, to beg, in order to raise the money to bring a judicial review against the coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC in January . As a result of that action the High Court then ordered Sir Peter to reconsider. But the recent Court of Appeal ruling upheld his initial decision.He had decided to exclude the murderers and we couldnt in conscience allow him to do that, which is why we sought the judicial review.We have been denied legal aid six times. When we applied for legal aid to bring the judicial review, they refused it on the basis that since our crowd-funding was going so well, we should continue to go down that path. Ive got that in writing. So theyre looking at us going out and prostituting ourselves, begging. And in England and Wales, youve got to remember, begging is illegal.The way I see it, is that they want us to break the law to enable us to fight the law. And the second reason they denied us legal aid - and remember that the legal aid department is supposed to be independent of government and impartial - is because they said: \"We see no merit in your case to bring a judicial review.\" To me, that means that that makes them judge and jury.We raised the money with the fantastic support of the football fraternity. And guess what  We won. We won the judicial review. Butwe had listened to the legal aid department and had not followed through, that would have meant yet another miscarriage of justice.How many miscarriages of justice must the families be made to suffer before they get true accountability In all the earlier hearings, whenever the Home Office and MI and MI showed up, they kept saying weve got no documentation on the Birmingham pub bombings. Nothing at all.On the biggest mass murder in England in the th century. And theyve go no paperwork whatsoever  Paddy Hill has told me that he knows and has seen that theres a room, floor to ceiling jam-packed with boxes of paperwork to do with the Birmingham pub bombings.Q. So you believe that the authorities have something to hide A. Yes. Theyre protecting their own agents. This is what Brian and I have always thought. We believe they knew the bombings were going to happen because, as is now known, the IRA was % infiltrated.So it means they either had someone infiltrated in the Birmingham gang or they had an informer who knew that it was going to happen. And they allowed it to happen. They just dont want that to come out. Look at Stakekne. It appears to us that successive British governments have been more than happy and accepting of allowing their own citizens to be murdered as a way of undermining the IRAs campaign.Q. Do you feel that the IRA top brass who gave the orders bear as much responsibility as the men who actually carried out the bombings A. Well, it would be equal wouldnt it  The men who gave the orders are quite possibly even more gutless than those who did it, because they sat back and let somebody  do the dirty work that they chose not to do. And they dont want to take responsibility for it either.Theyre all gutless. From the top to the bottom. Every single one of them. They are gutless cowards. They are oxygen thieves. They do not deserve the right to have a le.And the fact that they all had full lives, they had families and they are quite possibly still alive, is just an insult to all victims of terrorism. They have created not just the grief and loss of the families left behind, but for the survivors, the psychological issues and the distortion and destruction of family le.When you murder one person, you destroy the whole nucleus of the family. It is not just one le that is shattered and gone. It is everybodys le that is shattered forever.Q. Can you sum that up, the toll that Maxines murder has taken on your own le A.Oh, God. Thats such a laden question. Well, first, I chose not to have children because of Maxine.The thought of losing a child... Im not strong enough for that. How our mother ever coped... mum identied Maxine after the bombing. She identied her. She only told us that a few years ago. She protected us from knowing that. But she identied her.And she couldnt identy her by her face, because the bomb blast, the phosphorus, had marked her hair into her face.So I decided I could never have children, because the thought of losing a child, or of anything happening to a child of mine... I wouldnt have been able to cope.And as Ive got older, Ive realised that Ive never really had very many friends. And maybe thats because Im not a very nice person. Nobody really knows who you are. People themselves dont really know who they are.I try and be a good person. But, you know,somebody says I need to calm down, I know that Ive got a very short fuse sometimes. I dont bear a grudge, though. Except for murderers. Ive not had very many friends, but Ive thought that is my own fault because I dont want to get close to people. Because when you get close to people, you get attached. And when you get attached you have feelings and when you lose them... I dont want to feel that sense of loss.Ive got a friend whos got lots of animals and she says to me: \"You know, you should get cats and dogs, theyre just so loving.\" But I cant have a dog. They die. And I dont want to have to grieve for something that I know is going to die. People find that hard to grasp. But this is the way I am.I also think it has to do with the fact that when I was  I was run over in an accident. I nearly died. I had a fractured skull. I was unconscious for nine days. And one of the side-effects of that is having a short temper.I dont knowthat is mixed up with the grief and the loss and all that, because grief and trauma hit people in dferent ways. When I was younger I used to drink a lot. I was never an alcoholic, but I used to drink. I dont drink now.But I remember going round the nightclub that Id be at and Id be crying on peoples shoulders. Sobbing about Maxine. I was only . I dont really have any memories of childhood after the bomb. No memories up until I was about .But I do remember going round the nightclub crying. And I think to myself now, how embarrassing. Not only for me, but for them. If I met those people now, Id apologise profusely to them. They didnt want to share my grief.But I was young and when Maxine was killed there was nothing like counselling or anything like that. She was murdered on the Thursday and we went back to school on the Monday.Q. Are you optimistic that some day you will get justice - some form of justice - for Maxine A. Oh, yes. Because the more they try and block us, the more it stirs the fire in our bellies.Nothing, nothing, but nothing, will stop us from getting to the truth. Nothing. Other than killing us. And I wouldnt put it past them.And Im being serious there. Brian and I have always said its not the IRA were worried about, its our own establishment, because they can, and do, bury their own.Q. A new memorial to the victims of the bombings is being unveiled this month at New Street Station in Birmingham, paid for with money raised by the Irish community in the city.A. Yes. The project has been overseen by the Birmingham Irish Association. When Brian and I started our campaign, nearly a decade ago, we always said that we wanted to try and rebuild the fracture between the community in Birmingham and the Irish community.After the bombings,you were Irish in Birmingham, people wanted to hang you. Quite literally. Mum always told us you cant hate a whole nation on the back of a gang of cowards who are in essence just psychopaths.Ive just come back from a conference in Belfast organised by the victims campaigner Raymond McCord and for all the trauma that people there have suffered, theyre just so hospitable, so lovely.Ive been invited to attend conferences with the Bloody Sunday families. And the Ballymurphy families. Its really lovely to have met them. Were all fighting for exactly the same thing and were all being blocked by the same institutions and establishment for decades.So, that is the question we need answered - what is it that theyre so afraid of The Justice For The  website address is www.justicetheThe innocent victims of Birmingham tragedyOver  people were injured when the Birmingham bombs exploded - many lost limbs and had le changing injuries.

bpanews_b-b--cf-eeb_EmailMichel Barnier will update ministers from European Union nations on the state of the Brexit negotiations as domestic pressure on Theresa May intensies..pushBoris Johnson claimed Mrs May is on the brink of “total surrender” to the EU over Brexit as he urged the Cabinet to mutiny against the Prime Minister’s withdrawal agenda.And another Brexiteer former cabinet minister, John Whittingdale, said it was dficult to see how Mrs May’s premiership could continueMPs rejected any Brexit deal she brought back to Parliament.Pro-Brexit Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom added to Tory tensions by insisting the UK could not be “trapped” in a backstop agreement without the ability to leave at a time of its choosing.The fallout from July’s Chequers summit continues four months later Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson suggested thatMrs May’s plans for a backstop customs deal with the EU – aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland – went through, the UK could be reduced to the status of a colony.In a stinging attack on the PM’s proposals ahead of a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said Mrs May’s agenda would see the UK “remain in captivity”.Mr Johnson said plans for a backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union with the EUa solution to the Irish border issue could not be found, would be worse than remaining in the EU.Mrs May is under fire from both wings of the Tory party after the shock resignation from the Government of Mr Johnson’s pro-European brother Jo, who also delivered a withering attack on the PM’s stance.That move fired speculation that more ministers who backed Remain in the referendum campaign could also quit.Boris Johnson resigned following the Cabinet session on Brexit at Chequers in July and further details of that crunch meeting revealed Remain-leaning ministers also voiced concerns.Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Chancellor Philip Hammond raised concerns about the Chequers plan, the BBC reported.Mr Javid described the proposal for a common rule book with the EU for goods and agriculture as “very worrying”, while Mr Hammond questioned whether the  other countries in the union would accept such a plan, the broadcaster said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Writing in the Daily , Mr Johnson said that eventhe Government got the EU to agree to giving London a unilateral exit option from the backstop, it would be meaningless.“The awful truth is that eventhe Cabinet mutinies – as they ought – it will make little dference.“Evenwe agree with the EU that the UK must have a unilateral break clause, so that we can go our own sweet way at a time of our own choosing, it is irrelevant because the programme and ambition of the Government is to remain in captivity, to stay in our cell, evenwe are given the theoretical key to escape.”Former culture secretary Mr Whittingdale said Mrs May would have to goshe could not get a Brexit deal through the Commons.He told BBC Radio ’s The Westminster Hour: “I thinkthe Prime Minister’s Brexit plan doesn’t get through Parliament, I think it’s quite dficult to see how the Prime Minister can continue because she has staked her credibility.”Remain-supporting former education secretary Justine Greening said she did not think the Chequers plan would get through a “gridlocked” Parliament.“We should be planning as to how we can put this final say on Brexit in the hands of the British people,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today.Hope of getting a deal for the Cabinet to sign off on Tuesday appeared to be rapidly receding, but talks are continuing in Brussels.The apparent impasse makes it much harder for the PM to secure a special EU conference in November to settle Brexit terms.But in a sign of Downing Street attempting to push the process forward, Mrs May’s key Brexit adviser Olly Robbins held talks with counterparts in Brussels over the weekend.Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, will address ministers from the  remaining EU nations at a general affairs council meeting in Brussels on Monday."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37517334.ece/7c322/AUTOCROP/w620h342/rogheda-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"drogheda gangland feud escalates after pipe bomb placed

Those responsible have branded by the local politician as ldquogrossly irresponsible.Cllr Curran described those who engage in such behaviour as ldquoselfless, reminding them that they are guilty of an environmental crime by dumping their waste in unauthorised areas.There are a number of illegal dumping hot spots across the district with the Downpatrick councillor suggesting the mentality of those responsible is particularly dficult to fathom.ldquoI cannot understand why people do not make use of household waste centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoThe mentality of those who dump waste along rural roads is beyond me. What puzzles me most is that people who engage in this activity end up paying for its removal through their rates bills. They are literally costing themselves money, but that does not appear to register with them.Cllr Curran said there was no excuse for illegal dumping as there were so many ways for people to dispose of their waste legally and safely.ldquoFly tipping and illegal dumping results in a blot on the landscape and is an image no one wants to see. I firmly believe that those responsible for despicable behaviour should feel the full force of the law, otherwise this activity will continue, he warned.ldquoIllegal waste can range from bin bags dumped at the side of the road to old household furniture, rubble or old trees. For a modest fee, bulk waste can be collected outside peoplersquos homes.ldquoFor the le of me I do not understand why people are prepared to load up their vehicles and drive to secluded, rural areas to get rid of household waste. Why not just drive to one of the three household centres in our district Cllr Curran said local council officials were placing increasing emphasis on promoting the district as a major tourist destination and the last thing they wanted to see was roads littered with waste.He added: ldquoThe message must go out that illegal dumping is unacceptable and that the countryside and indeed town centres must be respected, not used as open air dumps by people who should know better.ldquoWe are fortunate to live in a stunningly beautul area which should not be blighted by the reprehensible actions of a mindless few. Our rural areas in particular must be respected, not used as open air dumping grounds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballycran have it all to do in final  ","story":"BALLYCRANrsquoS hurlers are hoping that history repeats itself at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Sunday when they take on Cushendall in the Ulster Club Hurling Championship final.Itrsquos  years since the McKenna Park side last lted the Four Seasons Cup. That was in Cushendall are the aristocrats of the competition and while Ballycran have lost all three final appearances since their historic win in , the Ruairi Ogs have been crowned undisputed Ulster champions on no less than five occasions.Ballycran booked their place in this yearrsquos showdown after a sizzling display of open hurling, blasted holders and hot favourites Slaughtneil out of the competition.Gary Savagersquos boys were rated as   outsiders against the defending champions, but they left Slaughtneil in tatters with an impressive display.Savage was part of the team that lted the trophy in  and in addition to now managing the side, his two sons, Liam and Phelim, help control matters on the field of play.Both boys are certainly chips off the old block and Phelim, despite still being a minor player this season, is showing his true pedigree by dominating games from the centre half back berth and midfield.He is surrounded by a host of top class hurlers with Michael Hughes Stephen Keith, Scott and Brett Nicholson, Conor Woods, James Coyle and Colm McManus to feed off.Ballycran lost both their Antrim League games against Cushendall by signicant margins, but championship finals are a dferent animal and Gary Savage will have his side in a voracious frame of mind for Sunday. Cushendall are expected to lt the Ulster crown for a record-breaking th time.

I initially lobbied for more investment in the park and am glad local council officials took this on board and are developing a masterplan with public input at its heart.Cllr Andrews said he was pleased to take part in last weekrsquos consultation and was impressed at how many people took the time to attend, confirming he will be supporting the motion and views outdoor leisure as an economic driver for the whole region.ldquoThe people who attended last weekrsquos event agree that the country park is a major tourism asset and offers signicant development potential which must be appropriate and not spoil what is already in place, he continued.ldquoDelamont can act as a major economic driver and benefit not just the immediate killyleagh area, but the wider district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rogue trader tried to swindle £7k from Newcastle pensioner  ","story":"A FRAUDSTER tried to scam an  year-old Newcastle woman out of nearly pound, for tarmacing her driveway which he had deliberately damaged, Downpatrick Court has heard.Dean James Winderstood shamefaced in the court on Thursday on five charges relating to work he carried out in February.Winder, who traded as Unique Style Driveways, admitted one charge of fraud by misrepresentation and three further charges of aggressive, misleading, and unfair commercial practice.He was also admitted using an inaccurate service flyer which failed to say that his business was registered in England.All offences took place between February -.The court heard that the scam may never have been uncovered had it not have been for the actions of a taxi driver.Police praised the driver who raised the alarm with the Trading Standards Service after he learnt of what was happening as he brought the woman to a bank to withdraw pound,.Trading Standards called the police who arrested Winder and another person at the scene.Winder was given  hours of community service and fined pound by District Judge Amanda Brady for his actions, which were later condemned by police as ldquodisgusting.He was also instructed to immediately pay back pound, which he had taken from the woman as a deposit.A prosecution lawyer said that Winder approached the woman and her partner unsolicitedly to power wash and seal a paved area at their Mourneview Road home for pound.However, after doing the work, Winder pointed out some problems with the driveway and offered to do further work for pound,, which was increased to pound, to tarmac the full driveway.Some of the problems that Winder had pointed out in the driveway were those he had actually created while doing the first job, the prosecutor added.A defence lawyer acknowledged that Winder, now with an address at Holmes Avenue, Dreghorn in Irvine, Scotland, had seen an opportunity to get further work from the elderly couple and had done a ldquopoor job of tarmacing the driveway.However, he said Winder had made a full admission for his actions, offered his apologies and had turned up in court with the full amount of money to be ed to the elderly householder.The lawyer added that while there was another man involved in the work and transaction, Winder was ing the money on his own.Judge Brady described Winderrsquos actions as ldquomean-spirited. She told him: ldquoYou took advantage of an elderly person, quite deliberately, and deliberately damaged her driveway to get more money.Winderrsquos conviction was later welcomed by the police.Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: ldquoThis was a callous and calculated act by Winder who deliberately set out to scam this couple out of their hard-earned money.ldquoWhat Winder did was disgusting and I hope the courtrsquos judgement will bring some level of comfort and reassurance to the couple.ldquoI would also like to praise the taxi driver who raised the alarm and thank our colleagues in Trading Standards Service.Chief Superintendent Walls also appealed to friends and family of older or vulnerable people to talk to them about lsquocold callersrsquo and make sure they know what to do when salespeople come to their door.He added: ldquoNot all cold callers are rogue traders, but some are. If you feel that something isnrsquot quite right, it usually isnrsquot.ldquoUnofficial traders can overcharge unsuspecting and often older householders for poor quality work, or work that is never completed at all.ldquoRemember, itrsquos your home and itrsquos OK not to open the dooryou have any concerns.

Keenan quickly tagged on a rsquo with two Morgan frees stretching the lead to four points by the th minute.Ballymartin were far from playing the role of bystanders, but they managed to shoot seven wides against the wind, misses that proved crucial at the finish.With  minutes gone Chris McKay had a stinging shot crash off the crossbar following a stunning passage of play, but Keenan and Morgan ensured St Johnrsquos kept ticking over with points apiece.Ballymartin continued to waste several good scoring opportunities before Michael Higgins picked up his sidersquos first score in added time at the end of the first half as St Johnrsquos went in with a - to - lead.It took the protagonists a while to settle in after the break, but with  minutes gone Cathal Doyle reduced the arrears to four points with a score from play. St Johnrsquos then cruelly lost the services of the influential Eoin Moag to a black card and minutes later he was followed for an early bath by Darren Savage, who received a second yellow and then red.St Johnrsquos backs were now to the wall and Ballymartin made sure they stayed there. However, another Morgan free stretched St Johnrsquos lead to - to - before the real Ballymartin fightback started.Consecutive points from Michael Cunningham, Ryan OrsquoHareand Ross Cunningham left a single point in it and Ballymartin were in the right tack.The Lilywhites pushed and probed for the equalising score, but with the game in added time St Johnrsquos broke free and a surging run from Conor Flanagan ended with him setting up Branf for the match-winning score.Just to rub salt into the wounds, Morgan added a point from play to leave St Johnrsquos with their Division  status intact.St Johnrsquos: D Morgan, C Magorrian, A Morgan, J Addis, D Savage, R Flanagan, M Grant, A McMullan, E Moag, C Brannf , C Morgan , C McKay, M Keenan , J Clarke, C Flanagan.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

You had to be . “Since then I’ve run  consecutive Belfast Marathon. I’ve only missed the first one out of .”He explained how are several years competing in his home town marathon his running shoes took him further afield: “After running the marathon for a few years I saw an advert for a charity event to raise money to go and run the Boston Marathon, the world’s oldest marathon. Some of the medals Gary has accumulated over the years“I thought it would be fantastic to do that. I raised part of the money and paid the rest of it myself. It was good enough to get me the guaranteed entry. That was in , it’s was the th Boston Marathon.“While I was running in Boston I heard guys talking about a new marathon in Antarctica. That was another one I wanted to do.“I signed up for that and then started thinking about the Seven Continents, because once I’d done Antarctica that would be three out of seven.“I completed the seven continents a few years ago. As far as I’m awareI’m the only person from Northern Ireland to do that. I got invited to Belfast City Hall and met the Lord Mayor.”Gary Bell with his Arctic Marathon medalNot one to rest on his laurels, Gary set himself a new running target: “The next goal I set myself was the Six Marathon Majors. These are the six most popular marathons in the world which attract huge crowds. For example the recent New York Marathon had over , runners.”New York along with Boston, Chicago, London, Berlin and Toyko make up the biggest six marathons in the world.Gary said: “I started with Boston in  and since then it has taken me  years to complete the Seven Continents, Six World Marathon Majors and the two polar regions.”Michelle Keegan urges women to go for cervical cancer screenings Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Asked what his most memorable marathon was, he said: “The one that blew me away the most was the Boston Marathon. Gary competing in the Sydney Marathon“To be able to take part in the th marathon was amazing. At one point I ended up running with the American flag. There were so many runners taking part that it took  minutes to get to the start line. The elite runners were five miles ahead of us by the time we started.”Gary’s most recent race saw him complete the Polar CircleMarathon.He said: “I’d done the Antarctic as one of my Seven Continents, so I’d always wanted to do both polar regions.“The marked dference would be there is absolutely no le or buildings on the Antarctic. I think the only thing that can survive in the winter when it hits minus  are the penguins.“For the Arctic Marathon we went to Greenland and while it’s still remote there are  permanent inhabits.“As regards training for the North and South Pole, it was the usual distance training I do, you just can’t really replicate those temperatures.Gary has taken part in a marathon on all seven continents, here he is in Africa“One of the days we were there it was minus . I’ve never felt cold like it. Thankfully it warmed up for the race but it was still well into the minuses.“We just had to wear a lot of extra layers. We ran with three layers, two sets of gloves, two sets of socks, a hat, and a scarf that covers right up to your eyes.”Gary said the Antarctic Marathon was the most bizarre race he had ever taken part in.“It was due to be run on one of four research bases they have down there,” he said.“There was  runners from all over the world but on the day of the race there were mph winds so we couldn’t get off the ice cruiser – the Zodiac – to get onto the base where the course was flagged out.“The tour organiser said we’d leave it for  hours and then come back the next day. When we came back the same time the next morning it was still mph winds.“We were told the race would have to be cancelled. People had travelled all over the world to do the race, it was part of their seven continents. There was going to be uproar.”At this point the organiser and ship’s captain got together and came up with a solution – to run the marathon on the ship.Gary said: It was  laps of the ship. They padded up doorways with towels. Every time you came round you shouted out your number and it was scored off for another lap by friends and family who were there.“We got our finishers medals and our certicate so it was all official.”Of the Arctic Marathon which he completed on October  he said: “I actually had an injury before I went to do the race – a bio-overload on the fourth metatarsal plantar plate. I had to take painkillers. There was no way after all the organisation I was pulling out.”He commented: “The thing that drives me is the challenge. I’m not an elite runner but I’m someone who likes to succeed in my challenges. It’s the satisfaction of not only getting round the course but of completing the likes of the Seven Continents which takes a bit of time and planning your itinerary, your finances, your training.“I would do one marathon a year for charity. The reason for that is because I tend to ask the same people for money all the timeand they are very generous. To ask more than once a year would be a bit much I would find it uncomfortable to ask.“I tend to go for the cancer charities because I’ve a couple of people who have died from cancer.”Of his future goals he said: “There’s two things that I really want to do. As a purist I would love to run my home city marathon  straight times.“I’ve got to . I would love to do  in a row. I know injury is going to play a part soI can’t get  straight, I’d still love to do  in total.“I’d be  by that time, which is right on retirement age ironically.“The other thing I’d love to do is join the  Marathon Club. I think it’s  I’m up to at the minute.“They present you with a club vest on the day of your  marathon and you get a wee tot of whisky to toast the achievement at the end.”In his younger days, Gary Bell used to combine his marathon training with an amateur football career.The salesman, who was born and bred in Finaghy, but is now living in Newtownabbey, said: “I played centre forward for Sirocco Works in the amateur league for  seasons. It was a pretty good standard.“I was able to mix both running and football. I’d go for a longer run then meet up with the guys for the training after.The long run had loosened me up for the sprints.“I was in a running club many, many years ago but now I train on my own because it’s much easier to go out and suit yourself with times, distances, indoor or outdoor.”He commented: “I would say the two qualities of a marathon runner are time and discipline.“If you’re coming back home in the evening – it’s dark, it’s raining, you’ve maybe had a bad day – it’s easy to say, ‘let’s see what’s on the TV, I’ll forget about it tonight, I’ll do it tomorrow night’. “It’s the discipline of actually getting up and getting ready and getting out the door.“You also need to have the time to put in the training.“In my book the marathon is your reward for your training. It’s easy running the marathon when you’ve your training done.”He added: “I really enjoy the half marathons too. I’ve ran probably  plus half marathons.“They’re a great training run for the full marathon and you can really attack the course a lot more.“With the marathon there’s a lot more survival attached to it. The marathon is the challenge purely because of the extra distance.”Sharing some training tips he said: “I do it in steps when I’m doing my training. I’ll do  miles, then increase it to , then , then . It’s too much just to jump from  to . Doing a half marathon doesn’t mean you’re ready for a marathon.“Evenyou’re only up to  miles before a marathon, psychologically you’re going to get round. You’re running with a lot of other runners, you have company, you have the crowd. You’ll get over the line.While Gary said completing the marathons was his primary target, he does like to keep an eye on his time: “My best time is around the three hours  minute mark. As you get older sparing the time to do the training is where it gets dficult and that’s why times get slower. You’re only as good as your last training session.

Butwe can’t identy and shame offenders then there may be no alternative.”On the other side of the argument it was pointed out: “It’s not fair to ban all dog walkers for the minority that can’t pick up after their dogs although I can see your point, we bring our wee dog up and you literally have to watch every step the pitch is covered! Absolutely disgusting.”Another said: “Likely it’s few spoiling it for the many but it’s a rugby club not a dog walking club, anddog mess in wounds results in an infection or even an amputationthen it’s the right decision, especially when s of kids train and play there as well as the seniors.”It’s not an uncommon problem. The pitches in Lurgan Park have long been a favoured spot for dog walkers, and again while the majority appear to be responsible and picking up after their pooches there are a few who have turned the area into a pooh minefield.DUP leader and Dublin minister both mark WWI carnage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"For players it adds an extra level of ‘danger’ to the sliding tackle but even dog walkers are having to watch their step.One regular walker there said: “You really do have to watch your step on the pitches. Some people really are so thoughtless when it comes to picking up after their dogs, or should I say not picking up.“It gives all dog walkers a bad name and is so unnecessary as the council not only provide plenty of bins to dispose of the waste but also free poop bags.”try catch     .               ..

Located on Pearse Street right beside Trinity College in the heart of Dublin city, it made the perfect location to for the tour, with quirky and fascinating décor and superbly stylish and comfy rooms to retreat to after a day’s exploration.After unpacking, we progressed to the veranda, mixing with guests from all over the island. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly and boded well for dinner in the Courtyard Restaurant, which included ham hock, blackberry sorbet, and a iety of cheeses and enjoyable wines.Of particular note was the delicious freshly baked bread, the creme brulee and the sirloin and the craic was good with a friendly and cosmopolitan mix of guests.After a very comfortable night, the breakfast was also top class, albeit, for once you are recommended not to try everything as one is typically tempted to, leaving room for the gourmet tour ahead.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity,Our guide for the day was likeable foodie historian and former chef Chris Binchy. Starting in the heart of Trinity University campus, he gave a fascinating talk on the evolution of Irish cuisine. Our parents and their parents, he noted, would have enjoyed a pretty nutriotious but plain diet which ied little from week to week. Originally dominated by dairy produce, as Irish society was organised around cattle, the arrival of the French Normans in the th century brought a dferent type of agriculture and cultivation of crops.Dairy products, oats, fruit and root vegetables, cabbage, bacon, eggs and chicken were later added to with scones, tarts and pastries.With the advent of cheap air travel in the s, however, came easy access to the cuisine of France and Italy and a real revolution began the strengths of top quality Irish ingredients then began to be married to the Latin flair and creativity, giving what is today the st century foodie haunts across the city. Consequently, our first stop was a dedicated cheese shop, Sheridans, where we were entertained and informed by a true French man, who took care to extol the virtues of a wide range of new Irish cheeses made in the French style, all of which were passed around with crackers to sample.Next up was Powerscourt Shopping Centre, what was traditionally a wide open quadrangle in the centre of classic four storey Georgian buildings, but has been transformed into a charming indoor shopping complex, the central feature of which is the glass roof.A centre of all things ‘design’, we were treated to scones and cream from the Pepper Pot, which has a pedigree in custom baked breads and bagels, with a cult following among locals. They serve six dferent breads, all baked daily, which form the centre of all their dishes. Who knew Irish cream is dferent to English cream - clotted and not whipped with no sugar it is delicious enough without anything added, we were informed. DUP leader and Dublin minister both mark WWI carnage Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Next up was the Loose Canon, deliberately named after a colourful cleric. Specialising in natural cheeses, which were delicious, we also sampled a range of delicate parma-style hams, some of which were produced at Ballycastle and have a revered following in Dublin on account of the quality produce. For a change of pace we then popped into a traditional Victorian pub, the Swann, however this was a pub with a dference. It is ‘the’ rugby pub of Dublin, traditionally favoured by touring players the night before games - in the amateur era at least. It was run by legendary Ireland and Lions prop, Sean Lynch. Now run by his son Ronan, Sean still pulls the odd pint behind the bar and the rugby memorabilia on the walls is worth studying.This was followed by a trip to George’s street arcade, filled with ‘boho’ stalls and second hand bookshops, where we stopped at Lolly and Cooks for ‘Savage Rolls’ in Dublin the word ‘savage’ means ‘great’ and boy did these sausage rolls deserve the label. As big as your fist, they were as delicious as the meat loaf my mother used to make. Our last stop was the Temple Bar food market, which is even a hidden gem even to many Dubliners. As you enter, you may hear passionate yells from the acting school a few floors up, while a kaleidoscope of smells invade your senses.First up we tried the fresh oysters and the Temple Oyster Bar - surprisingly delicious. After that we moved onto the Market Kitchen, a food stall with a dference their menu on any morning depends on what all the speciality stalls around them are selling that day. We had sourdough with tahini and pumpkin puree, kale and chilli - out of this world! An interesting and worthwhile tour for visiting friends or family, stag and hen weekends or business trips. * Including overnight accommodation with breakfast and a Fab Food Trail, prices start from £ per room based on two people sharing.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme.

It has gotten to the stage that our party is very concerned that the lack of structure is having a detrimental impact on the council’s ability to provide a quality service for our rate payers. “By not having this task completed council’s ability to be proactive and respond \u2028to local needs is being hampered.“The responsibility for the implementation of these structures lies with the most senior officials within the Council and it is about time it was sorted once and for all.“I am calling on the Council to implement a realistic time line for completion of this task to move immediately to ensure every possible effort is made to give our employees and rate payers assurances that this is being taken seriously.“We must ensure our employees know they are valued and appreciated and that any inequalities are immediately corrected.Morale must be boosted and creating the new structure will go some way to helping with that.”A Council spokesperson said: “The Council is going through a period of unprecedented change, the biggest change in Local Government in  years.Raw sewage bubbles up into City ParkMakeover for intensive care family room Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“With three large Councils coming together as one - making the second largest Council in NI - we are working through a number of complex HRissues so that our staff are treated fairly and equitably and structures are fit for purpose, providing the services local people need - whilst providing the best value for ratepayers. “We continue to work in partnership with our Trade Unions and staff to implement a structure that will support our community into the future.

Butwe can’t identy and shame offenders then there may be no alternative.”On the other side of the argument it was pointed out: “It’s not fair to ban all dog walkers for the minority that can’t pick up after their dogs although I can see your point, we bring our wee dog up and you literally have to watch every step the pitch is covered! Absolutely disgusting.”Another said: “Likely it’s few spoiling it for the many but it’s a rugby club not a dog walking club, anddog mess in wounds results in an infection or even an amputationthen it’s the right decision, especially when s of kids train and play there as well as the seniors.”It’s not an uncommon problem. The pitches in Lurgan Park have long been a favoured spot for dog walkers, and again while the majority appear to be responsible and picking up after their pooches there are a few who have turned the area into a pooh minefield.‘Eventful weekend’ for policeFamily escape injury following arson attack at house Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"For players it adds an extra level of ‘danger’ to the sliding tackle but even dog walkers are having to watch their step.One regular walker there said: “You really do have to watch your step on the pitches.

The celebrations were hosted at an event at Purobeach club, which included a fire show and live acts, all with the backdrop of the Mediterranean Sea.“Pinnacle’s th anniversary in business is a very important milestone for us and it had to be marked by thanking the staff who have made the business the success it is today and for the success we will build tomorrow,” James Spencer, managing director of Pinnacle said.“We wanted every inidual in the organisation to feel thanked and special – from our teams fronting calls in reception, right through to sales, marketing, support, consultants as well as the management team.“The company has ambitious growth plans within our Sage and IT services isions, and our staff are key to this success.”And Fran McKee, marketing director of Pinnacle, who organised the event, said:“We have created some very memorable events for our team around key milestones in the business, but venturing to the sun and hosting a white party on the beach was pretty special and unique.“Purobeach and the Tivoli Hotel were chosen for their sophisticated ambiance, location, views and accessibility. The event was hosted in June and there is still a buzz in the business post event”.Pinnacle is a true home-grown success story starting as an IT business in east Belfast, it has grown from humble beginnings to become a £m turnover organisation, with more than  staff working from  UK and Ireland offices, servicing over , customer sites.And  years on, Pinnacle is one of the largest and most successful suppliers of Sage in the UK and Ireland.You can follow Pinnacle’s journey on social with the hashtag #FacesOfPinnacleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Brian-1121.jpg","title":"brian mcgrath we were swept up in a national brexit debate which wasnt relevant for us","story":"Posted on Friday November  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew speaks to Foyle Port chief executive Brian McGrath about sharing UK and Irish waters, the burden of increased bureaucracy but looking at a potential Brexit silver-lining coming down the line There’s a surprising air of optimism surrounding Brian McGrath when it comes to the UK’s exit from the EU.While the Foyle Port chief believes the £m business – which handles around £.bn in commodities each year – could feel the bureaucratic hand of a post-Brexit environment, such as delays, paperwork and a potential “logjam”, that it’s in a unique position, sharing both UK and Irish waters.But he believes the Irish border was a mere “second thought” when Brexit campaigning was at its height – instead, focused around an emotional argument around immigration. A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Riccc.jpg","title":"ni house prices outpace uk market","story":"Posted on Wednesday November  by John Mulgrew RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey Northern Ireland homes have avoided a UK-wide dip in prices, according to a new survey. The latest RICS and Ulster Bank Residential Market Survey shows a larger proportion of surveyors pointing to a rise in the average cost of a home. That was a higher level than anywhere  in the UK, during October. It says that “Northern Ireland surveyors are also the most optimistic, looking forward. A net balance of % expects prices to rise in the three months ahead, while a net balance of % expects the number of sales to increase in the same timeframe. Most other regions expect prices and sales activity to fall or be broadly flat in the final quarter”. In terms of supply, the survey pointed to a slight rise in properties coming onto the market in Northern Ireland for the first time in five months. RICS residential property spokesman, Samuel Dickey said: “Interest from first time buyers and a strong rental have been two of the factors driving the Northern Ireland housing market, with first time buyers and investors both very active this year. “Surveyors remain confident about the market, despite political and economic uncertainty, and  is shaping up to have been a more positive picture for the housing market than perhaps was initially anticipated.” Terry Robb, head of personal banking at Ulster Bank, said: “As the survey indicates, demand remains relatively strong and we continue to see a good-pipeline of mortgage applications. “Our new paperless mortgage process has generated interest but more fundamentally, interest in the market remains firm from a broad range of mortgage purchasers including first time buyers, home movers and those remortgaging.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
