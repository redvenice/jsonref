He said: \u0027She was amazing, very satisfying. In the islands we don\u0027t kiss and tell, but there were no complaints in that department\u0027          Misick says their relationship fizzled out because of the long distance and he began dating the actress and model LisaRaye McCoy (pictured together in 2006), whom he married the next year. He says they broke off ties for good after McCoy spotted him chatting to Omarosa at an NAACP event and angrily demanded they end their friendship\u0027She would always give me sound advice. In fact I wish I had taken more of her advice - some things would have been different.\u0027 Omarosa has never publicly disclosed the fling with Misick, which he says took place in 2005 after she orced her first husband, Aaron Stallworth. She was a rising reality TV star at the time, having achieved infamy one year earlier as the villain of the first Season of The Apprentice. The well-connected pair first crossed paths at a charity function in New York when they were introduced by a mutual friend.\u0027Clearly there was chemistry. We chatted for a very, very longtime. She\u0027s a beautiful and amazing woman. I was attracted to her,\u0027 the ex-Premier recalled. Misick was in the US to court celebrities and well-heeled tourists in a bid to bring wealth and glamour to his sun-drenched archipelago, southeast of the Bahamas. But the smooth-talking statesman said he would end up spending the entire weekend with Omarosa, touring Manhattan and enjoying intimate nights at his suite at the plush Four Seasons Hotel. \u0027I knew who she was and she knew who I was. What struck me about her was her intellect. She was highly intelligent which is not the first thing that comes to mind with a reality star,\u0027 Misick said. \u0027She was highly knowledgeable about politics and world affairs. We had a very interesting, stimulating conversation. \u0027We were obviously mature, consenting adults who were both single at the time and we were smitten with each another. So, yes, we did spend an amazing time together.\u0027 Misick would fly back to New York just a week later with the fledgling couple enjoying a romantic dinner date at Sylvia\u0027s Harlem restaurant, famed for its soul food and celebrity clientele.             The two began their romps in 2005, meeting at a charity function in New York after the Apprentice villain orced her first husband, Aaron Stallworth (pictured together in 2004)          Misick\u0027s tenure in the Turks and Caicos ended in notoriety when he was accused of corruption by the British government who forced him to stand down in 2009 and imposed direct rule          Omarosa\u0027s first \u0027White House\u0027: Misick said Omarosa was a regular visitor to the Turks and Caicos during their six month tryst. Pictured: Misick\u0027s former $8 million mansion, nicknamed the \u0027White House\u0027Weeks later she would accompany him to Dubai, where he slipped away from official functions to entertain her at the One and Only Royal Mirage Hotel, where suites cost $6,000 a night. \u0027We were dating, to use the American term,\u0027 said Misick, who has been married three times and has six children by five different women. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say that we were monogamous - that question never came up. We were dating, we were getting to know each other and having fun. \u0027She was amazing, very satisfying. In the islands we don\u0027t kiss and tell, but without kissing and telling, there were no complaints in that department.\u0027 Omarosa was a regular visitor to the Turks and Caicos during the six month tryst, sometimes taking along her mom Theresa - who calls herself Momarosa - to enjoy the swank resorts and restaurants laid on by Misick. \u0027Her and her mother have a special relationship and they were really nice people,\u0027 he said, sitting down with DailyMailTV on the island of Providenciales, the archipelago\u0027s principle tourism hub.           \u0027She was highly intelligent which is not the first thing that comes to mind with a reality star,\u0027 Misick said. Pictured: Omarosa around the time of their tryst in 2005The lovebirds were seen together at official functions and attended the South Caicos Regatta, where Misick recalls they were caught out by the tides and got stuck on a sandbar for hours. \u0027We just chilled and enjoyed the moment,\u0027 he said with a smile. \u0027We would have had catering on the boat, strawberries, grapes, fruits, champagne, beer, whiskey. And seafood - fish, conch, lobster.\u0027 He added of their time together: \u0027Most of the time it would be three or four days or a long weekend. We would either stay at a resort or my residence.\u0027Omarosa enjoyed the water. She loved the beach, she loved to swim, she loved boating. \u0027She was not a big drinker but of course everyone loves champagne. She respected the office that I had so she never did anything improper while she was with me. \u0027She was a fun person but she wasn\u0027t a wild, party crazy type of woman. I\u0027ve clearly dated those types as well, but she was not one of those. \u0027I never saw her indulge in over-drinking or drugs or anything like that. I think she could have made a good First Lady.\u0027 Misick, who married this year for the third time, says he was impressed by Omarosa\u0027s networking skills and contacts in the world of celebrity and politics. The Howard University alumnus had previously worked in the office of Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration, though she was later panned by her former administrator as the \u0027worst hire we ever made\u0027. Determined to transform the Turks and Caicos into the \u0027Monte Carlo of the Caribbean\u0027, Misick asked Omarosa to help raise his profile in the US, particularly among his key tourism demographic of wealthy African Americans.\u0027I would ask her the best way to market our destination,\u0027 he said. \u0027She\u0027s a very strong, powerful and opinionated woman. I\u0027m not intimidated by a strong women, I embrace strong women. \u0027She would give her advice and sometimes it was strong but ultimately as the person who was the leader of the country, it was my decision to make.\u0027           Trump and Omarosa have fallen out bitterly since her abrupt departure from the White House, with Omarosa aiming a series of barbs at her former boss in her best-selling memoir, Unhinged          Misick said he believed Omarosa and Trump were \u0027friends\u0027 with a \u0027love hate relationship\u0027. He added: \u0027Clearly something happened and he wanted her out of the White House so maybe the circumstances made her change her loyalty\u0027 Misick told DailyMailTV he also discussed Omarosa\u0027s time on The Apprentice with her - and her relationship with Donald Trump, who would later appoint her director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison. The pair have fallen out bitterly since her abrupt departure from the White House, with Omarosa aiming a series of barbs at her former boss in her best-selling memoir, Unhinged. She also alleges that tapes exist dating back to their time together filming The Apprentice in which the President is caught on mic using the N-word.\u0027They were friends. They seemed to have a love hate relationship. She was a Democrat at that time and maybe he was at the time as well, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 recalled Misick. \u0027I was not surprised he chose her to be part of his government. She clearly is controversial and there seems to have been mixed feelings even amongst the African American community, but she\u0027s very competent from my standpoint. Full Disclosure: Most shocking things about Donald Trump in...Share this article\u0027I know her to be a loyal person but even loyalty sometimes changes. Clearly something happened and he wanted her out of the White House so maybe the circumstances made her change her loyalty. He added: \u0027I can\u0027t recall whether she ever told me that Mr Trump used the n-word. I know Mr Trump as well, I\u0027ve gone to events at his estate, Mar-a-Lago. \u0027At one stage we were talking to them about hosting the Miss Universe pageant. In all my interactions with him he\u0027s been very respectful and I\u0027ve certainly not heard him use the N-word.\u0027 Misick says his relationship with Omarosa fizzled because of the long distance between them and he began dating the actress and model LisaRaye McCoy, whom he later married in 2006 but orced two years later. He says they broke off ties for good after McCoy spotted him chatting to Omarosa at an NAACP event and angrily demanded they end their friendship.           \u0027We were dating, to use the American term,\u0027 said Misick, who has been married three times and has six children by five women. The lovebirds were seen together at official functions and attended the South Caicos Regatta, where Misick recalls they were caught out by the tides and got stuck on a sandbar for hours          Last year Omarosa married Florida-based pastor John Allen Newman (pictured together in 2016) and became First Lady of his downtown Jacksonville churchOmarosa subsequently began dating Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan who died of a heart attack in 2012. Last year she married Florida-based pastor John Allen Newman and became First Lady of his downtown Jacksonville church.Misick, meanwhile, was linked to a string of high-profile US actresses and celebs including Rocsi Diaz, best known as the co-host on the BET show 106 \u0026amp Park, and Nicole Murphy, ex-wife of comedian Eddie Murphy. He also built himself a sprawling $8 million mansion, nicknamed the \u0027White House,\u0027 which the British government now accuses him of funding through graft. Misick was appointed Premier of the Turks and Caicos in 2003, taking charge of a country with limited infrastructure and few modern amenities.His supporters say he oversaw a period of massive growth, developing hotels, resorts and establishing it as an A-list vacation spot. But after a landslide second election win in 2007 he demanded the island\u0027s British-appointed Governor begin the process towards a referendum on independence from the UK. British officials responded by launching an investigation into Misick that accused him of ushering in massive corruption and \u0027a palpable climate of fear\u0027. They also questioned how someone with declared assets of $50,000 when he came into power could be living a playboy lifestyle complete with Presidential-style mansion and leased private jet.           Misick was put on trial in December 2015 for fraud, bribery and money laundering in a case that has been dragging on ever since, costing its citizens an estimated $1 million every month          In 2009 the UK declared a national emergency, suspending the constitution and taking back control of the island. Misick and other ministers were accused of financing lavish lifestyles by acquiring publicly-owned land and selling it to developers. Before charges were brought, Misick moved to Brazil where his claim for asylum was rejected and he was handed over to Interpol to be returned to the Turks and Caicos. He has spent the last three years on trial in a court case which is estimated to be costing the country of just 31,000 inhabitants around $1 million a month. \u0027I just couldn\u0027t accept that you can get elected and then you have some civil servant from England come and dictate to you how you should run your country,\u0027 he told DailyMailTV.\u0027I found that offensive then and I still find that offensive. We know what\u0027s best for our country - we want to be free.\u0027Misick has described his nation\u0027s official status as a British Overseas Territory as a \u0027relic\u0027 of colonialism and alleges his prosecution is a racially-driven political witch-hunt.\u0027As a matter of fact, the then-governor in a cable to London said, \u0027we have to stop Misick now because he\u0027s popular and he wants independence. And unless we stop him now, nothing will stop him.\u0027          Misick also hopes to add Omarosa\u0027s Unhinged to his reading list in the coming weeks. \u0027I haven\u0027t read her book as yet. I\u0027m waiting for an autographed copy,\u0027 he joked\u0027So they used that as an opportunity to make these allegations of corruption. I resigned from office in 2009 and I\u0027ve had the last, almost ten years fighting these alleged charges,\u0027 he said. The prosecution is Misick\u0027s trial is due to rest its case in the next few weeks when his legal team will argue there is no case to answer.He has sold the White House and remains on bail. The globe-trotting former politician is not allowed to leave the Turks and Caicos without the permission of the courts. A short-lived attempt at a political comeback ended in failure in December 2016 when Misick stood as an independent candidate in the general election but received less than 6 percent of the vote.He plans to have another go \u0027when, and not if\u0027 he is cleared. \u0027I have never solicited or accepted a bribe from anyone. And I intend to do whatever it takes to clear my name and defend myself until the last breath is in my body,\u0027 he vowed.Misick also hopes to add Omarosa\u0027s Unhinged to his reading list in the coming weeks.\u0027I haven\u0027t read her book as yet.

Everything from cash machines to home heating systems, from electricity generators to mobile phones and the health service relies on cyber technology. We have seen many times in recent years the enormous disruption caused by a temporary breakdown in service, as happened during the botched IT upgrade at the TSB bank.Similarly, 18 months ago the NHS was hit by a major cyber problem, prompting the mass cancellation of operations. Then the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un was cynical enough to take the blame and the fear inspired by that. But it is clear, from the wealth of mounting evidence, that the Russians certainly have the capability and determination to launch similar attacks.If patients’ lives were put at risk by such a cyber attack, it would create a real global panic – the cyber-equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis.That is why we should be worried. What is happening now in cyberspace is even more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable than the darkest days of the Cold War.For all the anxieties back then about a nuclear stand-off, at least the hostility between the West and the Soviet Bloc was governed by respected boundaries. The rules – such as a prohibition on assassinations – were generally upheld. Both sides communicated with each other, partly from the need to avoid a nuclear apocalypse through a catastrophic misunderstanding.That culture has disappeared. We live in a much more fluid world where restrictions on movement – especially in Europe – hardly exist at all. At any given moment there are probably more than 100,000 Russians in Britain, most of them wholly innocent and here to work, study or enjoy a break. Yet that transient mass also provides cover for hostile intelligence agents.Moreover, technology makes it much easier for someone to cause mayhem. During the Cold War, if the Soviets wanted to hit a water pumping station or sabotage an aircraft, they had to send in armed agents. Today, that could be accomplished from an office in Moscow or Kiev – just as computer programs can churn out millions of emails to damage businesses, influence elections and propagate fake news.          Grainy surveillance footage shows the moment Dutch intelligence officers descended on the scene and caught the four men outside the chemical weapons agency          Pictures released at the briefing show the cache of equipment seized from the menThen there are the armies of hackers in ‘troll’ factories who spread destabilising information, such as Hillary Clinton’s emails or the details of Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins’ asthma prescriptions. The aim is to undermine public respect for Western politicians and heroes alike.The fall of the Berlin Wall almost three decades ago was a remarkable triumph for freedom and capitalism over totalitarianism. But that ascendancy lulled Western politicians into a false sense of security.Russia, which has an economy no bigger than that of Britain or France, is showing daily that if resources are focused on a certain area – in this case cyber warfare – then a nation can still have lethal power.And we are only just coming to terms with it. Yesterday Lord Ricketts, who served as Britain’s National Security Adviser until 2012, warned that the recent plots are just the start, ‘pilot projects’ to test defences in advance of a full-blooded cyber assault to bring anarchy to the West.          Russian president Vladimir Putin waves to spectators prior to boarding a car after his arrival in New Delhi as the GRU\u0027s campaign of cyber warfare against the west was today exposedAs president Putin’s invasion of Crimea and his support for the Assad regime in Syria has shown, he is not a man constrained by normal democratic values. Throughout his presidency he has been pushing at boundaries, seeing what he can get away with, what will provoke the West to act.Now his dwindling popularity at home over his domestic agenda – particularly his attempt to raise the retirement age – makes it all the more imperative for him to wrap himself in the nationalist flag with high-profile attacks on the West.At least the complacency in Europe and America is beginning to lift and we are starting to fight back – as highlighted by the unprecedented news conference yesterday in which the Dutch defence minister, Ank Bijleveld, and Peter Wilson, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, explained how the OPCW conspiracy was foiled.In the context of cyber warfare, the West has unparalleled expertise. The staff of both the US National Security Agency and our own formidable base at GCHQ in Cheltenham have world-beating abilities in hacking computers and other electronic devices.So far the West has proved far more restrained than Russia in deploying that expertise. There is only one documented case of Western agents using a computer against an enemy state’s infrastructure.

Pictured: Matt Lauer and Megyn Kelly on the show on November 2Before adding of any negative comments about the segment, she said: \u0027All I\u0027m going to say is that I feel very strongly about the #MeToo coverage, the importance of doing it without fear or favor.\u0027I didn\u0027t let anyone stop me at Fox, and I\u0027m not going to let anyone stop me at NBC.\u0027But the 47-year-old doesn\u0027t believe that all men accused of harassment should have a blanket ban on returning to work.Kelly, who said she was harassed by former Fox boss Roger Ailes, explained: \u0027I feel it\u0027s a case-by-case basis.\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think we need to see Harvey Weinstein in polite society ever again, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true of everyone. I think, for some of these guys, there\u0027s a way forward. I happen to believe it starts with a full-throated apology, and not just this paper statement of, \u0027I did some things wrong and I\u0027m sorry.\u0027She said that women wanted to see, not just punishment, but that they had changed and grown. \u0027I think Americans are very forgiving, and I am very forgiving,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think these guys who want to completely skirt around it and just reappear and re-emerge in their old roles are kidding themselves,\u0027 she added. \u0027Women are feeling too empowered to allow that.           The former Fox anchor, pictured with Lauer in May last year, said she knew more than she could let on, telling US Weekly: \u0027I know too much that others don\u0027t know\u0027\u0027They don\u0027t want to just see punishment, they want to see that you get it. And the ones that we\u0027ve covered publicly had immense positions of power, so they absolutely should not be allowed to return to those until we understand there\u0027s been a sea change in their thinking and behavior.\u0027Meanwhile, Kelly has been focused on keeping her own job safe amid her show\u0027s tanking ratings, executives at NBC News tell DailyMailTV exclusively.The former Fox News host launched her much-hyped show Megyn Kelly Today last September after securing a three-year contract for a staggering $69 million.Despite NBC heavily promoting the 47-year-old\u0027s show, her ratings have been abysmal, with viewers changing the channel when the Today show ends over to rival ABC\u0027s Live with Kelly and Ryan.Megyn began extensively covering the #MeToo movement in a bid to carve out a place for her show, even covering her own colleagues at the network who had been accused or fired over allegations of sexual misconduct, most notably Matt Lauer and Tom Brokaw. Multiple top executives at NBC tell DailyMailTV they believe she has strategically positioned herself as a champion of #MeToo in case her show is cancelled, paving the way for a potential suit for being fired for speaking out against her employer.              Megyn began extensively covering the #MeToo movement in a bid to carve out a place for her show, NBC executives tell DailyMailTV, as a strategic plan in case her show is cancelled, paving the way for a potential suit for being fired for speaking out against her employerA high-ranking source at NBC told DailyMailTV: \u0027Everyone has had enough and they want Megyn out. \u0027It\u0027s like she\u0027s the Manchurian candidate of NBC News - someone put inside the network to take it down from within.\u0027Her strategy is the talk of 30 Rock. As soon as her show became a dumpster fire she actively positioned it as the only place on network television that it is \u0027\u0027MeToo\u0027\u0027 continually.\u0027By aggressively reporting on every male accused of sexual misconduct at the network, it would make her much harder to fire. \u0027If NBC did fire her, she\u0027ll argue she was terminated for speaking up, when in fact she is an opportunist who latched on to an important movement when nothing else was working for her.\u0027Let\u0027s be frank - a woman determined to support other women wouldn\u0027t have launched her show by asking Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery.\u0027  NBC president Andy Lack, who has been accused of turning a blind eye towards sexual misconduct claims at the network, is said to be \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Megyn\u0027s attempts to turn her show into a forum for the movement, including her coverage of claims against Brokaw and Lauer. An NBC News spokesperson responded in a statement: \u0027None of this is true. NBC News is thrilled that Megyn is on our team and extremely proud of her work including her coverage of the #MeToo movement since her earliest days at the network. \u0027We are also very pleased with her 9am show, which is substantive, empowering and engaging.\u0027        Megyn has positioned herself as a champion of #MeToo, even covering her own colleagues at the network who have faced sexual misconduct claims, such as Matt Lauer and Tom Brokaw               After Lauer was fired from the Today show in November 2017 following reports of sexual harassment, Megyn was the first to have a TV interview with Addie Collins Zinone (pictured), who had an affair with Matt LauerAfter Lauer was fired from the Today show in November 2017 following reports of sexual harassment, Megyn was the first to have a TV interview with Addie Collins Zinone. Zinone had a month-long affair with Lauer in 2000 when she was just a 24-year-old production assistant at Today.While Zinone said the relationship was consensual, she added that the power dynamics had made her later regret the relationship. Kelly\u0027s show hit its one year anniversary this month and she donned a little black dress and leopard heels, celebrating the milestone that many thought she wouldn\u0027t see, considering her disappointing ratings.ABC\u0027s rival show Live with Kelly and Ryan, starring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, has been trouncing Megyn\u0027s show, consistently beating her out in viewership. A top NBC brass added to DailyMailTV: \u0027The ratings show that when Megyn comes on, the audience leaves and switches over to Kelly and Ryan on ABC.\u0027Here is the highest paid on air personality actively tearing down the network at 9am every morning.  \u0027The anchors, producers and executives all share the same opinion - Megyn Kelly needs to leave NBC!\u0027 An NBC News spokesperson pointed to research that shows Megyn averaged 2.4 million viewers in September - the highest it has been since February.               Despite NBC backing Megyn\u0027s show, her ratings have been abysmal, with viewers quickly changing the channel when the Today show ends over to rival ABC\u0027s Live with Kelly and RyanFor Megyn\u0027s low ratings, her hefty salary of $23 million a year - $69 million over the course of three years - is seen as a \u0027mistake\u0027 by senior NBC executives. At the time of her deal, Lauer, who had been the network\u0027s shining star for more than a decade, was estimated to be earning $25 million a year - just $2 million more than Megyn, NBC\u0027s gamble on a newcomer.A network executive said to DailyMailTV: \u0027Her salary is also unfair - why should she be paid more than Savannah and Hoda combined. \u0027Two talented anchors who are loved by the audience and who viewers actively choose to watch. \u0027How is she worth more than Al Roker, Kathie Lee Gifford or Jimmy Fallon - all beloved household names that hold far greater star power at NBC and beyond.\u0027   Insiders say NBC has already mapped out a scenario for Kelly\u0027s exit where they could actually break even. By terminating her, NBC would be obligated to pay out the remainder of her contract. But they would be able to replace a very expensive hour of television with one that gets better ratings and is almost free to produce. NBC would immediately be able to replace Kelly in the 9am hour of Today by bringing back Al Roker to that hour, possibly combining him with Dylan Dreyer, a duo who executives expect will increase the 9am hour\u0027s ratings by 15-20 percent, thereby grow the hour\u0027s advertising revenue.More importantly, NBC would be able to bring the hour back to Studio 1A and drastically cut costs. Before Kelly arrived, NBC ran the 9am hour of Today at minimal expense, using the same studio and control room crew that produced Today\u0027s earlier hours and severely limiting costly taped pieces and food segments. Kelly\u0027s show, by contrast, is done in a separate studio and has a whole separate staff and spends lavishly on production. NBC could save even more money by terminating those staffers.And Megyn is dealing with chaos behind the scenes of her show, as earlier this year the morning program\u0027s head writer claimed it was a \u0027completely toxic\u0027 environment.        Megyn Kelly knows ‘too much that others don’t know’ about Matt Lauer - AOL Entertainment"},{"url":null,"title":"Waitrose delivery trial let drivers home out","story":"Waitrose is trialling a delivery service that gives drivers access to customers\u0027 homes to unpack groceries while they\u0027re out           The service called While You\u0027re Away allows a customer with a Yale smart lock to set a temporary access code which is then sent to Waitrose via a secure appThe supermarket believes it is the first in the UK to test demand for such a service – initially with 100 customers located near its fulfilment centre in Coulsdon, south London – after seeing it prove popular in the US and Scandinavia. There is a minimum order of £25 and, initially at least, a minimum of six deliveries, although Waitrose said it would review this after the trial.Waitrose said it anticipated being able to make the service available to more than 1,000 customers in spring next year depending on the success of the trial.Oops!

Everything from cash machines to home heating systems, from electricity generators to mobile phones and the health service relies on cyber technology. We have seen many times in recent years the enormous disruption caused by a temporary breakdown in service, as happened during the botched IT upgrade at the TSB bank.Similarly, 18 months ago the NHS was hit by a major cyber problem, prompting the mass cancellation of operations. Then the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un was cynical enough to take the blame and the fear inspired by that. But it is clear, from the wealth of mounting evidence, that the Russians certainly have the capability and determination to launch similar attacks.If patients’ lives were put at risk by such a cyber attack, it would create a real global panic – the cyber-equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis.That is why we should be worried. What is happening now in cyberspace is even more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable than the darkest days of the Cold War.For all the anxieties back then about a nuclear stand-off, at least the hostility between the West and the Soviet Bloc was governed by respected boundaries. The rules – such as a prohibition on assassinations – were generally upheld. Both sides communicated with each other, partly from the need to avoid a nuclear apocalypse through a catastrophic misunderstanding.That culture has disappeared. We live in a much more fluid world where restrictions on movement – especially in Europe – hardly exist at all. At any given moment there are probably more than 100,000 Russians in Britain, most of them wholly innocent and here to work, study or enjoy a break. Yet that transient mass also provides cover for hostile intelligence agents.Moreover, technology makes it much easier for someone to cause mayhem. During the Cold War, if the Soviets wanted to hit a water pumping station or sabotage an aircraft, they had to send in armed agents. Today, that could be accomplished from an office in Moscow or Kiev – just as computer programs can churn out millions of emails to damage businesses, influence elections and propagate fake news.          Grainy surveillance footage shows the moment Dutch intelligence officers descended on the scene and caught the four men outside the chemical weapons agency          Pictures released at the briefing show the cache of equipment seized from the menThen there are the armies of hackers in ‘troll’ factories who spread destabilising information, such as Hillary Clinton’s emails or the details of Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins’ asthma prescriptions. The aim is to undermine public respect for Western politicians and heroes alike.The fall of the Berlin Wall almost three decades ago was a remarkable triumph for freedom and capitalism over totalitarianism. But that ascendancy lulled Western politicians into a false sense of security.Russia, which has an economy no bigger than that of Britain or France, is showing daily that if resources are focused on a certain area – in this case cyber warfare – then a nation can still have lethal power.And we are only just coming to terms with it. Yesterday Lord Ricketts, who served as Britain’s National Security Adviser until 2012, warned that the recent plots are just the start, ‘pilot projects’ to test defences in advance of a full-blooded cyber assault to bring anarchy to the West.          Russian president Vladimir Putin waves to spectators prior to boarding a car after his arrival in New Delhi as the GRU\u0027s campaign of cyber warfare against the west was today exposedAs president Putin’s invasion of Crimea and his support for the Assad regime in Syria has shown, he is not a man constrained by normal democratic values. Throughout his presidency he has been pushing at boundaries, seeing what he can get away with, what will provoke the West to act.Now his dwindling popularity at home over his domestic agenda – particularly his attempt to raise the retirement age – makes it all the more imperative for him to wrap himself in the nationalist flag with high-profile attacks on the West.At least the complacency in Europe and America is beginning to lift and we are starting to fight back – as highlighted by the unprecedented news conference yesterday in which the Dutch defence minister, Ank Bijleveld, and Peter Wilson, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, explained how the OPCW conspiracy was foiled.In the context of cyber warfare, the West has unparalleled expertise. The staff of both the US National Security Agency and our own formidable base at GCHQ in Cheltenham have world-beating abilities in hacking computers and other electronic devices.So far the West has proved far more restrained than Russia in deploying that expertise. There is only one documented case of Western agents using a computer against an enemy state’s infrastructure. That occurred when the Israelis and the Americans worked together to release the Stuxnet virus into the computers that operated Iran’s nuclear programme. It proved what the West can do if necessary.But any escalation in cyber warfare is fraught with risk. A miscalculation by any rogue agents, anxious to ingratiate themselves with the Kremlin, could have disastrous consequences.We do well to remember that the new world disorder, which Putin promotes as well as relishes, is our new reality. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/05/05/5103572F00000578-0-image-m-27_1538712798023.jpg","title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews Placebo Experiment","story":"    Dr Michael Mosley attempts to train his own body to respond to a vile tasting green drink Dr Michael washed down two high-strength caffeine pills with the gloop.

They attempted to smash up some of the phones (inset) when they realised authorities were on to them  These images, made available by the Dutch Ministry of Defence today, are said to show the hacking equipment that four Russian intelligence officers used for a cyber attack on the OPCW          The GRU - an acronym for Glavnoye razvedyvatel\u0027noye upravleniye or Main Intelligence Directorate - was founded in 1918 after Lenin\u0027s Bolshevik Revolution.Lenin insisted on its independence from other secret services and the GRU was seen as a rival by other Soviet secret services, such as the KGB.According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 - tough but unsophisticated.\u0027The GRU took its officers from the trenches,\u0027 he said, whereas KGB picked its agents from the USSR\u0027s best universities.The GRU would train agents and then send them to represent the Soviet Union abroad as military attaches in foreign embassies, according to historian John Barron.But once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to joined foreign agencies were punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning.Unlike the KGB, the GRU was not split up when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.It has a special status and answers directly to the chief of the general staff, one of the three people who control Russia\u0027s portable nuclear control system.GRU chiefs are reportedly picked by Putin himself.The GRU is now considered Russia\u0027s largest foreign intelligence service, according to Reuters, dwarfing Moscow\u0027s better-known Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which is the successor to the KGB\u0027s First Chief Directorate.Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in GRU , was considered by the Kremlin to be one of the most damaging spies of his generation.He was responsible for unmasking dozens of secret agents threatening Western interests by operating undercover in Europe.Col Skripal, 66, allegedly received £78,000 in exchange for taking huge risks to pass classified information to MI6.In 2006, he was sentenced to 13 years in a Russian labour camp after being convicted of passing invaluable Russian secrets to the UK.A senior source in Moscow said at the time: \u0027This man is a big hero for MI6.\u0027                                                       Unit 26165\u0027s trail of blunders: How Putin’s elite globe-trotting hacking squad left a trail of clues including a selfie at the Olympics, a pile of beer cans and a TAXI RECEIPT from their spy base to airportWestern intelligence yesterday revealed the trail of clues that bungling Russian spies known as Unit 26165 left in their wake as they waged a war of disinformation across the globe.Kremlin agents working for the GRU targeted FIFA, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Organisation for the Prevention of the use of Chemical Weapons as it investigated both the Salisbury novichok attack in the UK as well as the Douma chemical weapons attack in Syria, the international investigation of the downing of MH17 and a US company providing nuclear power to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin\u0027s elite squad even created the fake \u0027hacktivist\u0027 group Fancy Bears to disseminate misleading statements designed to exonerate Russia of doping allegations and instead level them at the US.But it was yesterday revealed that the spies left a trail of clues including blunder after blunder during their international campaign.             The team of four GRU officers travelling on official Russian passports entered the Netherlands on April 10 – but it turned out that two of them were carrying documents with consecutive passport numbers      bellingcat -

The New Jersey-based painter’s California debut has two concurrent exhibitions at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) and the California African American Museum (CAAM), both called Royal Flush. (It debuted last year as a single show at Duke University’s Nasher Museum.) Headlining a double feature like that had amounted to twice as many openings, and twice as many cocktail receptions.“I mean, I’m having a great time,” she told me over the phone on one of the more low-key days of her visit. She had just hired a Zipcar and was contemplating a trip to see King Tut at the California Science Center.“I’m excited to see the responses to my work,” she added, ostensibly the focus of her practice. Her paintings are engineered to elicit response. Royal Flush surveys the past 10 or so years since Abney graduated from Parsons’ MFA program and introduced the art world to her searing sense of humor. There’s a 2008 painting called Randaleeza at the ICA that summarizes the media fascination fueling her work. It’s a chaotic scene: there’s a woman in red lipstick and a white bikini next to a young man in a flannel shirt being shredded by a pack of dogs. If they look remotely familiar, well – the woman is former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, and the man in flannel is “my friend Randall”, Abney deadpans. (In the tradition of former it couples Bennifer and Brangelina, she portmanteaued their names for the title.) The dogs are Michael Vick’s, and the star tattoos on Condi’s shoulders belong to Lil Wayne, who was performing on an award show when Abney was painting.Having debuted at Chelsea gallery Kravets Wehby in a show called Dirty Wash (a phrase that alludes to gossip, or airing out one’s dirty laundry), Randaleeza embodies Abney’s talent for distilling the absurdity of American media and its convergence with tabloid culture into a new, singular narrative. Ten years of political tumult later, Abney’s work remains loaded with the cultural scandals of given point in time, but presented these days in almost complete ambiguity.While the acidity of her satire has never wavered, Royal Flush traces Abney’s development of a distinct and coded visual language. Figures are less figurative they’ve been abstracted into an erratic symphony of brighter colors and more basic shapes. They possess androgynous bodies and an array of skin tones, finding a universal appeal in their ambiguity. The kaleidoscopic, geometric blocks and fields of patterns frequently elicit comparisons to Picasso and Matisse. Abney has pointed to the layered cut-outs of Romare Bearden’s collage as a point of inspiration for her later works, as well as the advent of emojis. They’re a “universal language”, she says, one that’s simultaneously open to interpretation.Jeffrey Deitch, who commissioned Abney to paint a mural in Coney Island in 2016 (and whose New York gallery is currently hosting Punch, a show that she curated), compares her improvisational skills to those of Keith Haring. Rather than plan ahead, Abney works intuitively, mapping her compositions as she’s painting. “She has this ability to take a visual concept, expand it to mural size, and execute it perfectly with no hesitation,” he says. “It reminds me of a skill Haring had – to find the perfect rhythm, and to get everything right.”Abney takes the comparison as an utmost compliment Haring was universally loved, widely disseminating his art in the form of murals and merchandise. Wanting to appeal to the widest audience possible herself, Abney insists there are no judgments embedded into her paintings, or at least, she refuses to share them.“I would see how certain people would react to paintings that were clearly about race, and how they would shy away from that because they’re not black,” she says, with an open admission that she’s pulling a bait-and-switch. Their ambiguity gives the viewer options. The beauty is that anyone can read them however they like.Where socially aware art can teeter aggressively into overt, one-dimensional statements, Abney remains a covert operative. As a rule, her paintings remain inscrutable, but one of the few exceptions was a 2015 body of work called Always a Winner. Featuring a clear condemnation of police brutality, it prompted headlines aligning her work with the Black Lives Matter movement, exactly the kind of media pigeonholing she had wanted to avoid. Not wanting to be defined by a single political motivation comes down to the burden of representation forced on black artists. “If I paint a black figure, it can’t just be a figure,” she explains in the exhibition catalog. “It has to be about blackness or race or whatever, where white artists don’t have to think about those things.”Towards the end of Abney’s visit, she sat for a panel discussion at CAAM with ICA curator Jamillah James and CAAM Naima Keith deputy director. She led a rare explainer on some of the symbols she uses, flipping through projections of her source material: news clippings, protest signs, cartoons, vintage ads of Sea Monkeys. A heart on the canvas often denotes a figure in distress. At least one instance of text was pulled from Beyoncé’s Lemonade.Withholding the paintings’ meaning, however, is what asks you to spend time with them, parsing the symbols and assessing what exactly you’re looking at, and why they look so familiar. The explosive compositions are a visual assault of images we’ve been repeatedly exposed to, thanks to the similar assault of our current news cycle.“I’m working through it with the viewer,” she says of the unrelenting media. It’s like we’re going through a collective trauma that rarely finds closure and keeps us in a state of uncertainty. “You scroll through your timeline and it’s on to the next. Nobody’s talking about Bill Cosby anymore.”“People are sometimes mad at me because I can’t give them a specific meaning for a painting, but that’s not my agenda,” she adds. “My agenda is to present your Instagram timeline back to you so you can take time and digest it.” For better or for worse, the candy coating makes it easier to swallow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32e4ed4f3a1e0ccfa55d9281dd5ea8a928587752/0_317_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dc71f24c76ed4fb88d8b593172161fb","title":"how the world thinks julian baggini review","story":"Julian Baggini’s engaging survey argues that people everywhere grapple with the same moral questionsAncient Greeks often wondered whether non-Greeks could do philosophy. Some thought the discipline had its origins in the wisdom of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Some counted itinerant Scythian sages or Jewish preachers as philosophers. Others said no: whatever the intellectual merits of neighbouring peoples, it is a distinctively Greek practice. A new, angrier version of that ancient debate has arisen amid the culture wars of the last 50 years. Is philosophy an exclusively western phenomenon? Or is denying it to non-western peoples a form of neocolonialism? Or does the imperialism lie, rather, in folding non-western thought into a western category? Difficult questions, and the answers are not always obvious.Julian Baggini’s contribution is an engaging, urbane and humane global history. “History” here is a misnomer: this is not a systematic, chronological exposition of different intellectual traditions (anyone wanting that is better off with Peter Adamson’s podcast series Philosophy Without Any Gaps https:historyofphilosophy.net). Baggini’s strengths lie not in history (as is revealed, for example, when he ill-advisedly ticks off the Greek archaeological authorities for not advertising the Areopagus as the site of Socrates’ trial) but in a clear-sighted ability to boil complex arguments down to their essentials, and so to allow many different voices from across the world to converse in a virtual dialogue.In his view, people everywhere grapple with the same moral questions, which are fundamentally about balancing contradictory imperatives: inidual autonomy versus collective good the social need for impartial arbiters of truth versus awareness of subjective experience adherence to rules versus commonsense flexibility and so forth. The differences between people lie not in the issues they face, but in the positions they end up adopting on the scale between the extremes. The analogy he draws is with a producer in a recording studio: “By sliding controls up or down, the volume of each track can be increased or decreased.” All cultures play the same song, but some prefer the cymbals higher up in the mix.His conception of philosophy is not a narrowly academic one. We act as philosophers whenever we take a moral decision. Academic philosophies are bellwethers of the popular mood, and vice versa. For instance, the most influential philosophical tradition produced by the 20th-century US was the pragmatism of Richard Rorty, arguing that truth is merely what works best as truth for a given community. Baggini connects this to “something in the American psyche”, a “folk pragmatism” that “is unconcerned with intellectual niceties and focused on solutions”. Every culture has its philosophies, in the form of characteristic tendencies in decision-making. Philosophies are embedded in the material fabric that surrounds a people, in its architecture, its utensils, its experience of landscape.The focus on regional traditions can inevitably lead to caricatures. When confronted with a picture of a circle, we are told, “a westerner sees first and foremost a circle, the round line. A Japanese sees at least as immediately the space contained within the circle”. Well maybe, but it reads a little like gap-year ethnography. More awkwardly, he writes about his frustration at a meeting of the Indian Philosophical Congress, where “extreme deference was shown to invited speakers and grandees”, leading to rambling, over-running speeches such “fawning”, he argues, is connected to an emphasis in Indian philosophy on pratyaksa, the insight that comes to the wise as a result of long experience and practice. But to be fair, he repeatedly strives to break down simplistic cultural oppositions. Polarities are sketched not as ends in their own right, but as starting-points on a voyage to a more sophisticated understanding. Focusing on distinctions between East and West does not just ‘help to understand our differences, it points us to similarities which enable us to see these differences in more nuanced and sympathetic terms’.The book as a whole represents a covert plea for dialogue, compromise and humility. Time and again, Baggini exhorts us to follow the middle path between extremes, a principle that he sees as central to the philosophy of both Aristotle and Confucius. Sometimes these extremes map on to geography, as when he proposes that “it should be possible to avoid the excesses” of western “atomism without adopting wholesale an eastern-style relational conception of self”. But more often than not, what he advocates is simply a rebalancing, via greater self-consciousness about our moral choices. You may have good reasons for choosing personal freedom over obligation to the collective – but other ethical options are available.Global philosophy remains a paradox, and Baggini knows it: “To restrict philosophy only to that which falls under the purview of western philosophy is hopelessly narrow … However it can be difficult to get over our preconceptions of what philosophy must look like.” Spot on. For all that he fully acknowledges non-literate peoples have complex, sophisticated modes of abstract thought, he is drawn primarily to comparisons between the classical philosophies, the ancient literary traditions of China, India and Greece and their modern successors. It is hard to shake the sense that he finds some cultures’ philosophies more philosophical than others’. But my hunch is that he would be happy to acknowledge the partiality of his account certainly better to do this than to lay spurious claim to some kind of universality.No philosophy, he argues in conclusion, can escape the peculiarities of its own place even global philosophy must come from somewhere. The question is not where you’re from, but where you’re heading. In our embattled age, Baggini’s self-awareness, acuity and willingness to listen and learn point valuably away from parochial myopia and towards productive dialogue.• How the World Thinks: A Global History of Philosophy is published by Granta.

The company said it would pay compensation.The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “Without a specific deal on air transport, flights will come to a standstill on the evening of 29 March 2019. I’m not making this up. I’ve met many airlines and this is what they tell me.“The Tories are lost in their Brexit psychosis, ignoring the extreme economic damage they are about inflict on the country and people’s lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7cbab51b6ba3dcb412fa62c46287b3d42bb806/44_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83f651264ce01173ec39bcd28d544042","title":"waitrose trials in home delivery service","story":"‘While You’re Away’ gives drivers access to customers’ homes when they are out Waitrose is trialling an “in-home” delivery service that gives drivers access to customers’ homes to unpack groceries while they are out.The supermarket believes it is the first in the UK to test demand for such a service – initially with 100 customers in Coulsdon, south London – after it proved popular in the US and across Scandinavia.The service, called While You’re Away, allows a customer with Yale smart-lock technology to set a temporary access code that is sent to Waitrose via a secure app. The code is then sent to the delivery driver’s device at the time of arrival at the customer’s home and is deleted once the delivery is complete.The driver will put away goods that need to be refrigerated or frozen and leave other groceries on the kitchen counter, or as instructed by the customer.The delivery will be captured on a chest-camera worn by the driver, with the video available on request by the customer the next working day.There will be a minimum order of £25 and, initially at least, a minimum of six deliveries, although Waitrose said it would review this after the trial.Waitrose said it anticipated being able to make the service available to more than 1,000 customers in spring next year depending on the success of the trial.Archie Mason, the head of business development at Waitrose \u0026amp Partners, said: “There is certainly an increasing demand among our customers to make shopping with us even more convenient to fit around their busy lifestyles. Rather than waiting for a delivery or trying to put everything away, it gives customers more flexibility to use that time differently, including more time enjoying cooking and eating the food they’ve bought.“The concept of in-home delivery has started to prove popular in other countries so we are keen to establish if there is an appetite for it in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37bd231f6715dc9d7cd50d9172d6f35906f83d2/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab2017eae61ffa9694b7eef2eaa7c9af","title":"unilever abandons plans to move hq to netherlands business live","story":"The consumer goods giant behind Marmite and Persil is abandoning plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam after mounting shareholder opposition Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says Unilever’s decision to back track on plans to move its HQ to Rotterdam shows the power of institutional investors and puts pressure on the board.Today’s climbdown from Unilever over a plan which would have necessitated its exit from the FTSE 100 is an example of the power institutional investors can wield when they act in concert with one another.This brings into the question the credibility of Unilever’s insistence that the vast majority of shareholders were ‘fully supportive’ of its proposals ahead of the vote deadline in the UK and the Netherlands later this month.Abandoning its dual UK-Dutch stock market listing and moving its HQ to Rotterdam would have made Unilever, one of the London market’s leading lights, ineligible for the FTSE and many institutions complained they would have been forced sellers of the shares.The episode looks to have been badly mis-managed and the position of chief executive Paul Polman and the rest of the board is likely to come under severe scrutiny.The Investment Association, a trade body representing UK fund managers, says there was no reason for UK shareholders to vote in favour of Unilever’s move to Rotterdam, and has welcomed the firm’s decision to scrap the plans.The feedback from many of our members has been that there was no compelling reason for Plc shareholders to accept the proposed simplification in this form. They did not believe it would be in the long-term interests of their clients, and would have resulted in many shareholders being forced to sell their shares.We welcome the fact that Unilever has listened to the feedback from their shareholders and not pushed ahead with their plans. We look forward to engaging with the company on their future plans.The Dutch employers organisation VNO-NCW is blaming Brexit for Unilever’s decision:The website DutchNews.nl quotes the organisation:It is also an indication of what Brexit means, a hard fight for corporate locations.Unilever’s decision to keep its headquarters in London is a “huge blow” for the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and “a bit of a shocker.”Reaction from the Netherlands:The UK is happily celebrating Unilever’s decision to abandon plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam.But the mood in the Netherlands is likely to be less cheery, particularly as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was working on plans to scrap a idend tax in what was seen as a bid to attract Unilever.Reuters has this report:Unilever’s withdrawal of plans to move its headquarters to Rotterdam looked likely on Friday to trigger political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on idends.Unilever said it had given up on moving to Rotterdam for now under pressure from shareholders at its British arm, who worried about the future tax treatment of Dutch idends.Rutte, who worked for Unilever from 1992-2002 before entering politics, had yet to respond to the news early on Friday.While doubts have grown in recent weeks among dual-listed Unilever investors over the wisdom of the move to a sole HQ in the Netherlands, Rutte has been fighting an increasingly lonely battle in favour of scrapping the tax.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic, cautions that Halifax’s house price index tends to be volatile.Halifax’s data is very noisy, so we doubt September’s data signal that the Bank of England’s increase in Bank rate in August has pushed the housing market over the edge. Sustained falls in house prices at a national level aren’t likely. Even so, the combination of rising mortgage rates and heightened economic uncertainty will weigh on demand over the next six months, ensuring that year-over-year growth in house prices barely exceeds zero.The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has welcomed Unilever’s decision to keep its headquarters in the capital city. He says that despite Brexit, London will always be one of the best places to base a business.It’s great news that Unilever has chosen to keep its HQ in London and abandoned plans to move it to Rotterdam.Despite Theresa May’s appalling mishandling of the Brexit negotiations, the capital will always be one of the best cities in the world in which to do business.As Unilever works out its “next steps”, it is not yet clear where the unravelled plans leave the company’s chairman and chief executive.Shares in Unilever have opened a touch higher, after the FTSE 100 company announced it would not press ahead with plans to abandon its dual listing.The decision to abandon the plans for a move to Rotterdam will be a major blow to Unilever’s chief executive, Paul Polman, and the wider board.The London vote was always going to be the tricky one.Unilever acknowledged the lack of support in their statement this morning:We have had an extensive period of engagement with shareholders and have received widespread support for the principle behind simplification. However, we recognise that the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore consider it appropriate to withdraw.Unions had also come out against Unilever’s planned move, arguing that it was vital for the maker of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ice cream and other companies to stay in the UK.Investors understand the need for great British-based companies like Unilever to retain their headquarters in the UK.The UK’s weak takeover rules which put short-termism ahead of the long term are clearly a major factor in Unilever’s proposed move following a failed hostile takeover bid, as is the swirling uncertainty around Brexit. Ministers need to get a grip on Brexit and toughen takeover rules to stop more firms like Unilever seeking to flee overseas.A raft of shareholders had publicly come out in opposition to Unilever’s plan to abandon its dual governance structure and switch its headquarters from London to Rotterdam.UK investors including Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle, L\u0026ampG, M\u0026ampG, Royal London and Schroders had all stated they would vote against the plans.One of the main points of opposition was that Unilever would likely be ejected from the FTSE 100 - having been an original constituent in 1984 - and the FSTE All-share.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Breaking news: Unilever has abandoned plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam, after finally bowing to investor pressure.It means the consumer giant will remain listed on the FTSE 100 – one of the most contentious points in its planned move.Announcing the decision, which will be a major blow for the board, Unilever’s chairman Marijn Dekkers, said they will now consider the “next steps”. Unilever has built a long track record of consistent and competitive performance. The board continues to believe that simplifying our dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and serve the best long-term interests of Unilever.The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders. We will proceed with the plan to cancel the NV preference shares, further strengthening our corporate governance.More on Unilever soon.We’ll also bring you the latest from markets, where bonds are under pressure as expectations build for more US rate rises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/679bdd5e4ada85ebdf78e0458b41c780ea64f263/0_167_5006_3003/master/5006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4577d9e41c63705385240aaf391e5b4","title":"ex tory minister labour grasps britain desire change corbyn mcdonnell","story":"In addressing the failures of the market, house prices and low wages, Corbyn and McDonnell have caught the public moodSince the EU referendum, much of the focus on improving people’s lives that attracted me to join the Conservatives in government in May 2015 has vanished. The prime minister’s party conference speech suggested that these goals are not completely dormant, but many Tories still don’t seem to get this. They seem either obsessed with Brexit, exhausted by Brexit or, frankly, incapable of getting beyond rhetoric, the Westminster bubble and their rather small political party.Theresa May needs to follow through on her claim that austerity is nearly over – in contrast to the lack of action after her first speech outside No 10 on the “just about managing”. If not, the door will be open for a Labour government, even if it offers something much further to the left and has policies that many thought belonged to a bygone era.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, may regard deficit and debt reduction as the main purpose of his life – and many fiscal conservatives would applaud this, believing that keeping Britain’s monetary and fiscal policies stable lets the economy grow naturally. But this is a mistake when the country’s appetite for change is so obvious.A recent NatCen Social Research survey suggested that support for higher taxes was more popular than at any time since 2002. I have often wondered whether the mantra of “whatever else you do, promise to lower taxes” – which has driven all governments in recent decades, especially Conservative ones – is wise. The public’s desires may have shifted. So when I hear that a further commitment to lower corporation tax is being talked about, I have to wonder if this government has lost all sense of the public mood.By contrast, Labour has caught the mood of the country, crucially perhaps, in opposing the endless pursuit of lower taxes. The opposition may also have a stronger interest in addressing the failures of the market, in so far as they affect things such as productivity, wages, geographic inequality, intergenerational inequality, house prices and the overall purpose of business. What Labour lacks is credibility on monetary and fiscal stability. When the party talks of giving a productivity mandate to the Bank of England, I admire the goal but the Bank has only indirect tools to influence productivity.How a Corbyn government would manage fiscal policy, while prioritising its various plans for increased spending, is also far from clear. Without some version of Gordon Brown’s golden rule that couldn’t be fiddled, markets would be justified in fearing the reality of Labour in power. Indeed, if ideas such as capital controls are thrown around by the party then it may never be in a position to deliver on any of its manifesto ideas. If I were advising John McDonnell, I would tell him to get this in order.In the last four decades, hiring and firing workers in the UK has become much easier, to the point where capital investment is now less attractive. In these circumstances, it is not at all surprising that productivity is so weak. Changing the balance to help employees’ working conditions, including their earnings, should be part of addressing this. If businesses cannot see it themselves, then it is sensible for government to give them a push.Businesses need to rediscover purpose, as well as profit, which Labour can naturally focus on: having a genuine obligation to the health and wealth of their employees taking real long-term investment decisions helping to solve societal problems. All are things a modern successful private company should do, rather than obsessing over quarterly results.Boosting public sector and private sector investment – whether transport, utilities or a much more ambitious plan on housing (in particular, social housing), deserves support. As the Shelter social housing commission is likely to demonstrate, the UK has a major housing market problem, partly because not enough homes are built for those at lower income levels, which gives a persistent stimulus to the low-income rental market, which in turn leads to the price pressures on housing.• Jim O’Neill is the chair of Chatham House, a former chief economist for Goldman Sachs and a former Conservative Treasury minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01732f716b35abeb15fa7ce782d0f3342eb0b85/81_31_2251_1351/master/2251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78dfd522cdf1174888cdb95385e76660","title":"imaging tool unravels secrets of childs sock from ancient egypt","story":"Non-invasive technique devised by British Museum sheds light on dyeing and weaving processThe ancient Egyptians famously gave us paper and the pyramids, but were also early adopters of the stripy sock.Scientists at the British Museum have developed pioneering imaging to discover how enterprising Egyptians used dyes on a child’s sock, recovered from a rubbish dump in ancient Antinoupolis in Roman Egypt, and dating from 300AD.New multispectral imaging can establish which dyes were used – madder (red), woad (blue) and weld (yellow) – but also how people of the late antiquity period used double and sequential dying and weaving, and twisting fibres to create myriad colours from their scarce resources.Crucially, the imaging is non-invasive. Previously studying ancient textiles using radiocarbon dating and dye analysis required physical samples to be taken.Dr Joanne Dyer, a scientist in the museum’s department of scientific research who developed the approach, said: “It was exciting to find that the different coloured stripes found on the child’s sock were created using a combination of just three natural dyes.”The technique, details of which are published this week in the open-access journal PLOS ONE, looks at the luminescence of different dyes and uses digital microscopy to examine fibres. It allows many more textiles to be examined, adding a rich layer of discovery to the understanding of how events in this period affected people.“It means we can look at more, and a larger variety of, objects. We can see the relationship between more objects and different time periods,” said Dyer. “Late antiquity is a very long period, from 200AD to 800AD. Within that period in Egypt there are lots of thing happening. There is the Arab conquest of Egypt, the Romans leave Egypt. These events affect the economy, trade, access to materials, which is all reflected in the technical makeup of what people were wearing and how they were making these objects.”While socks have been around since the stone age, when cavemen used pelts or animal skins, the ancient Egyptians are thought to be responsible for the first knitted socks, styling them with one compartment for the big toe and another for the remaining four toes to accommodate their use with sandals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1a7122641bfd75374e15c0bf865de6fb46adf84/0_0_1170_1169/master/1170.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bafc86843844f1ff90e947a01f47dd7c 1010w","title":"working girl power suits female ambition modern equivalent","story":"The 80s movie celebrated women striving to get ahead. Now 30 years on, Hollywood seems to want to put women in their placeThe women in Working Girl looked amazing in their power suits. How do professional female characters dress now? Cyrus, by emailI like the cut of your jib, Cyrus! Any man who spends his evenings not just watching but RE-watching Working Girl is welcome to sit by me. And you are right, women don’t wear power suits in movies any more, but that is because women in real life don’t wear power suits these days. In fact, one of the most interesting fashion stories told in Working Girl, aside from that it really is possible to pay $6,000 for an item of clothing and “it’s not even leather”, is that you can see the power suit changing shape in this late-80s movie, shifting to something decidedly more 90s. Whereas Tess (Melanie Griffith) and Cynthia (Joan Cusack) wear big shoulders and heavy jackets, Katherine (Sigourney Weaver), the woman with the real power, wears far more minimalist, slimmed-down suits. As Tess gains power, she does, too. In the last scene, Tess turns up to her new job, which she thinks is a secretarial position, in a heavily shoulder-padded jacket. But when she realises she is actually the boss, the jacket starts to slip off her shoulders. It’s 1988, baby, and a new era is beginning: no longer do big shoulders symbolise female power.(Whether then having Harrison Ford then pack Griffith’s ickle wickle lunch box for her, as if she were his toddler daughter instead of his extremely impressive girlfriend, symbolises female power is a question we shall have to save for another day.)But your question touches, I think, on something that goes beyond suits, Cyrus. The question isn’t what do ambitious women wear in the movies these days, it’s why aren’t they celebrated in movies the way they used to be?Fortunately, a film comes out tomorrow that illustrates the point. Now, you might have thought that if I had written a 2,500-word article on A Star Is Born last week for this paper I might have got that film out of my system. Well, you, my friend, have underestimated just how much I overthink popular culture. Now who’s looking like the foolish one?While the new A Star Is Born sticks very closely to the 1954 and 1976 versions of this movie, it differs in one huge and telling way: whereas in the earlier films the female character becomes more successful than the man because she is more talented, in the new version it is just because she becomes a creative sell-out. Instead of making Ally (Lady Gaga) a better singer-songwriter than Jack (Bradley Cooper), the movie has her jettison her songwriting skill in order to become a pop star who sings garbage pop songs, dyes her hair silly colours and puts up with cheesy people around her. Thus, Jack remains An Artist while Ally is just a plastic product.It is a fascinating twist, partly because Cooper directed the movie and this is a definite change to the franchise that flatters his character. It is also interesting to do this to the movie now, in an era when female pop stars are such a dominant force: Beyoncé, Taylor, Rihanna, Ariana and – oh yeah! – Lady Gaga. The whole thing feels like a reassuring pat on the shoulder to all the male artists left in their dust, and it’s very weird to see Gaga play a character who feels too close for comfort. But this also feels like the natural conclusion to the direction Hollywood movies have been going in for the past few decades. Once female ambition was normal – sexy, even. Most obviously, in 1940’s His Girl Friday, Hildy’s (Rosalind Russell) professionalism is what Walter (Cary Grant) loves about her and, even when they marry at the end, it’s obvious they are going to work on their honeymoon, and he is delighted by it. In Working Girl, female ambition is sexy, in the form of Griffith – as long as she doesn’t become more successful than the man,\u0026nbspa problem embodied by Weaver.Which brings us to the 21st century and all you need to do to see how bad things have got is to compare Kay Thompson’s character in 1957’s Funny Face with Meryl Streep’s in 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada: they are both fashion magazine editors, but Streep’s professionalism is mocked whereas Thompson’s is admired. (And, of course, in true 21st-century romcom style, the conclusion of the latter film is that the young female character should give up her excellent job and try to get her boyfriend back. Yay women!)The question isn’t what ambitious women should wear in movies but when will ambitious women learn their lesson and give up their jobs for their men? Ally doesn’t in the latest A Star Is Born and, well, we all know how that turns out. A salutary tale to learn from, ladies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4ed04f6a2b4fade81b5b046e27e06aded30422c/90_0_1730_1038/master/1730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f230f06830ac065658cc6832f5ae52c9","title":"columbus review kogonada john cho","story":"The architecture is the star in the feature debut of the Korean-American critic Kogonada – a passionate drama with visual echoes of KubrickThe architecture is the star of this absorbing and intelligent debut feature from the Korean-American film critic and film-maker who works under the pseudonym Kogonada. In this quietly beguiling piece of work, he dares to do something beyond the reach or interest of many film-makers, and that’s simply to be different. Columbus is an engrossing and unexpectedly passionate film, although much of the passion is displaced outwards into a feeling for space, for mass, for building materials. It is a static passion, but not inert. I liked the film very much, although there are some self-consciously opaque contrivances about which I am unsure.The setting is the midwestern US town of Columbus, Indiana which happens to be a mecca for architecture fans and scholars because of a remarkable concentration of modernist work, including Eero Saarinen’s Irwin Union Bank and Myron Goldsmith’s Republic newspaper building. The various fascinating interiors and facades are explored in gorgeously unhurried, spacious shots that evoke Kubrick – a critical interest of Kogonada’s and an obvious influence here. (I wonder also if he took something from Jim Jarmusch’s movie Paterson.)Haley Lu Richardson is outstanding as Casey, a young high school graduate and fledgling architecture buff who loves her local celebrated buildings but can’t go off to college because she feels she has to look after her mother, a recovering drug addict. Quite fortuitously, she encounters Jin (John Cho), a man in early middle age who has come to Columbus because his father, a famous South Korean architect in town to deliver a prestigious lecture, has collapsed with a stroke and is in a serious condition in hospital. Like Casey, Jin has painful, complex emotions connected with family and loyalty. It is his duty to be at his father’s bedside up to the moment of what will very probably be his death in this strange land. But the two men are estranged, and Jin also has difficult unresolved feelings for his father’s companion or amanuensis, Eleanor (Parker Posey is excellent in this role), who is also by his side. Smart, ingenuous, emotionally generous Casey strikes up a friendship with Jin, and Cho shows how his character is tensely aware of how and where it might develop, and is uneasily aware of how she seems like a younger version of Eleanor.Architecture is not merely the backdrop or the bonding premise for their friendship. Notions of visibility and accessibility are vital. The wide panes of glass and low-level floors of a certain building allow Casey to make a crucial discovery about her mother. It is a very engaging film, though I was not entirely convinced by scenes in which Kogonada puts moments of dialogue behind glass, so you can’t hear what is said. Of course, the occlusion is deliberate – an expression of mystery and interiority – but I found it a little affected. Yet this is a challengingly intelligent film, and Richardson is just superb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e814092073db3a3969076e0ec73d3e51b41b5125/0_136_3008_1804/master/3008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6870803e0584db2b6608c211ef11276","title":"yayoi kusama infinity review documentary","story":"A celebratory introduction to the work of Yayoi Kusama, Japan’s biggest-selling living artist, hints at the roots of her obsessive pattern-makingHeather Lenz’s film is a brief, celebratory introduction to the work of Japan’s biggest-selling living artist: 89-year-old Yayoi Kusama. She rebelled against her stiflingly reactionary upbringing in provincial Matsumoto for a lifelong adventure in art. With vast, tapestry-like canvases and witty soft-material sculptures she experimented in abstract impressionism, pop art, and also live public-space happenings involving the naked body. Her career really began in New York, where she became a succès de scandale in the counter-culture scene, but she returned in early middle age to Matsumoto, where she had been widely reviled for her controversial artworks. In many ways, this is a story of a woman who had to fight her way to the top all over again, having battled depression, the complacent sexism and bland bigotry of the New York scene, and then finally the aghast conservatism of Japan.I would have liked to hear more personal detail about the artist. As a young woman she wrote a fan letter in English to the US artist Georgia O’Keeffe, so if she was taught English presumably her education was not as hidebound as all that? Lenz’s film also implies that, despite passionate platonic relationships, Kusama has never had sex at all, and that her displaced sexual energy has been poured into art that her obsessive-compulsive pattern-making may be the result of a hysterical reaction against sex, having reportedly as a child chanced upon her father having illicit sex with a woman who was not her mother.Her parents were apparently revolted by her American work, but if she returned to her home town, she must surely have had some sort of relation with them. Was a reconciliation reached before they died? Lenz doesn’t say. Also: her red hair. It might have been amusing to ask when Kusama decided to adopt this look permanently. (Lenz hints that she deliberately chose to wear kimonos in New York and play up Japaneseness as a USP.)Kusama’s work is, in fact, therapy, because she is permanently resident at a psychiatric hospital in Shinjuku, and works at her studio nearby. It would have been interesting to see her private life in the hospital, but Kusama would have been unlikely to agree to this kind of access. As it stands, the film is a respectful and valuable tribute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee1f688157b02d2643a3c4cea7f986000fd5245/0_119_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4958498e2958b3e03189e72cd7ee8fb9","title":"cristiano ronaldo left out portugal squad","story":"Nike has said it is “deeply concerned” after an investigation into a rape allegation against Cristiano Ronaldo was reopened this week while the 33-year-old’s club, Juventus, has faced a barrage of criticism on social media after issuing a tweet in support of “a great champion”.The US sportswear firm, with whom the player has a reported £768m endorsement deal, said: “We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.”The forward, Juventus’s €112m record signing, has strenuously denied accusations made by Kathryn Mayorga that she was raped by him in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009. This week the Las Vegas police force announced they would be returning to the case after Mayorga went public with her claims in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel.On Thursday, Juventus tweeted: “Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus. The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.”EA Sports, which also has a contract with Ronaldo, made similar comments to Nike, saying: “We are closely monitoring the situation, as we expect cover athletes and ambassadors to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA’s values.”Ronaldo, who captained Portugal to victory in the 2016 European Championship, was left out of the national side’s 23-man squad by Fernando Santos on Thursday for the Nations League fixture against Poland on 11 October and a friendly against Scotland three days later.The 33-year-old was also missing from the last Portugal squad, with Santos citing the player’s summer move to the Italian champions as the reason. Ronaldo played for Juventus in Serie A on Saturday but missed the midweek Champions League fixture against Young Boys after being sent off in the previous fixture against Valencia.He added on the national team’s Twitter feed: “In the future, nothing prevents Cristiano from giving his contribution to the national team.”Lawyers for Mayorga have this week sued Ronaldo in a district court in Clark County, Nevada, and on Wednesday gave a press conference in which they said the Portugal forward had 20 days from the filing of the lawsuit to respond.Mayorga was not at the conference and her lawyers claimed the alleged assault had caused her severe mental and emotional damage.“She has decided not to make herself available to the media and stay out of the public because of her emotional state,” attorney Leslie Stovall said. “It is not pleasant for her.”Her lawyers added they were considering whether to release documents they say relate to the case, including police reports, medical records and an out-of-court settlement that apparently included a non-disclosure agreement about the incident.They claimed that a psychiatrist had determined she suffers post-traumatic stress and depression because of the alleged 2009 attack in Las Vegas.Ronaldo issued a vehement denial of the accusations on Twitter. “I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me,” he said. “Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dee835d8367ce78c6e7428b7864e1558b761191/0_52_1514_908/master/1514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8adeeabcc5ae372bc31501ec1fd96945","title":"jose mourinho manchester united unacceptable lose newcastle","story":"José Mourinho has admitted it will be unacceptable if Manchester United fail to beat Newcastle United on Saturday and so go five matches without a victory, a run that has occurred only once since 1999.United’s last win was 3-0 over Young Boys in the Champions League in mid-September, since when Mourinho’s side have drawn two games and lost two, albeit one on penalties.United last went five matches without a victory in November and December of the 2015-16 season under Louis van Gaal. Mourinho, asked whether matching this sequence on Saturday would be not good enough at a club of United’s stature, said: “Yes, I accept.”If United fail to defeat Newcastle this would also mean five games at home without victory, which has not occurred since November-February of the 1989-90 campaign.Mourinho said he could not give the reasons for the uneven form but that improving the home record was vital. “Very important,” he said. “I know we are in the beginning of October and we look to tables all around Europe and in many of the leagues the tables in September, October don’t reflect what is going to happen in a few months later or even in the end of the season.“But we are in a position that we can do much better and to do that we need points points that we lost especially in the last two Premier League matches with one point out of six.”Mourinho praised Rafael Benítez, the Newcastle manager. “We know that to improve that position we need to win these three points. But we know that our opposition also need the points, a very good coach, a team that is always very well organised against especially the teams of the first part of the table where their manager is very bright on his analysis of the opposition qualities and to try to stop them.“The results they had against the top teams didn’t get them points yet this season but gave them very close results and very difficult matches for the opposition. So we expect a difficult match.”Asked why United were misfiring, Mourinho said: “For many different reasons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25f3de615f4193f850af9b63b32133cd4b6751be/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84a42e93434c14809a7df2508a6da91","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Liverpool’s tiredness could play into Manchester City’s hands, Newcastle should throw caution to the wind and Harry Winks must take his Tottenham chanceUnited by name but currently anything but behind the scenes, the teams managed by José Mourinho and Rafael Benítez meet at Old Trafford in a match that’s difficult to call. Manchester United’s performances at home this season have been unimpressive and if they cannot rouse themselves to beat a Newcastle side in a similar – albeit near permanent – state of disarray calls for Mourinho’s head are bound increase. Newcastle’s approach will be intriguing, given their hosts’ current lethargic performances and it will be fascinating to see if Benítez throws caution to the wind and takes the game to his old and once bitter rival’s side like so many other teams have done at Old Trafford this season. BGWhile Harry Winks has shown promise since breaking into Tottenham’s first team two years ago, the young midfielder is still finding his best form after recovering from an injury that forced him to have ankle surgery in May. However the 22-year-old must have picked up some valuable lessons during Wednesday’s 4-2 defeat by Barcelona at Wembley and he is likely to start again when Tottenham host Cardiff City. With Dele Alli, Mousa Dembélé and Christian Eriksen injured, Winks has a chance to nail down a place in the side and earn an England recall. It is a year since he made his international debut and he looked like he had a great chance of going to the World Cup after using his excellent passing range to help Tottenham beat Real Madrid last season. His luck has been out since then but Tottenham’s injury crisis has come at a good time for Winks, who has an opportunity to show that Mauricio Pochettino can build his midfield around him. JSWinless since beating Manchester United in August, Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion will be under pressure when they host West Ham. Chris Hughton’s side can struggle to assert themselves at times and needed to fight back from 2-0 down to earn draws with Fulham and Southampton last month. Yet perhaps their attack will have more spark now that José Izquierdo, who made his first appearance of the season as a late substitute against Manchester City last week, is fit again. The Colombian winger scored stunners in both of Brighton’s wins over West Ham last season and although he is probably not ready to start yet, he will be a useful option to bring off the bench to run at Pablo Zabaleta. JSOlivier Giroud was the hero when Chelsea recovered from 2-0 down to beat Southampton at St Mary’s last season. The former Arsenal striker scored twice as the west Londoners snatched a 3-2 win and he also grabbed the opening goal when Chelsea beat Southampton in their FA Cup semi-final in April. Giroud has scored once in the league since then and he drew another blank against Liverpool last week. But after drawing their last two league games, Chelsea could do with the Frenchman rediscovering his goalscoring touch this weekend. Maurizio Sarri will not want to keep relying on Eden Hazard. JSHaving taken only two minutes to set up Gylfi Sigurdsson’s second goal in Everton’s 3-0 win against Fulham, Bernard showed that even when given extremely limited time, he can make an impact. The 5ft 4in playmaker has yet to start a league game for Marco Silva’s side since his summer move from Shakhtar, but in his first full 90 minutes for the club against Southampton in the Carabao Cup, he showed enough creativity to give Silva a selection headache. Everton are not short of physical options in midfield, butthey are not overflowing with clever passers. Bernard’s inventive distribution would surely be appreciated by an effervescent and mobile forward such as Richarlison. Even if Silva opts for a more perfunctory midfield at Leicester, Bernard will likely be the first player he plucks from the bench should he need to unlock the home side’s defence. GBAn early contender for bottom billing on Match of the Day before a ball has been kicked, it hardly bodes well that in their only two previous Premier League meetings Burnley and Huddersfield have failed to muster a goal between them. Both matches ended with Sean Dyche seething over penalty box tumbles: a Rajiv van La Parra e that was spotted by the referee in the first game, followed by a Jonas Lössl foul on Jeff Hendrick that wasn’t in the second. After going 10 games without a win, Burnley recorded back-to-back victories in the Premier League for the first time since April last weekend and will fancy their chances of three on the spin against a Huddersfield side with three goals and two points on the Premier League board. Having lost defenders Terence Kongolo and Christopher Schindler to injury (the latter may be fit for Saturday) in defeat last weekend against Tottenham Hotspur, David Wagner has concerns at both ends of the pitch as the need for points becomes more pressing with each passing game. BGIt’s been an interesting few months for Marcus Bettinelli. In the summer Fulham bought two new goalkeepers, Fabri and Sergio Rico, so at the very least it looked like he had a scrap on his hands for his place. Even more so when Fabri started the first two games between the sticks, but Bettinelli was reinstalled for the third, has played every game since and was named in the most recent England squad. All of this despite conceding 11 goals in five games, contributing to what is the joint-worst defensive record in the Premier League. Some of the blame for that lies with the inconsistency in front of him, Slavisa Jokanovic having not namedbeen able to name the same defence twice so far. But Bettinelli’s international call-up remains a little curious, particularly with Joe Hart returning to form at Burnley. A clean sheet against Arsenal on Sunday would be helpful for everyone concerned. NMRoy Hodgson knows what’s coming when a journalist starts asking a question about Wilfried Zaha. It will be some variant on the idea that Crystal Palace are over-reliant on their best player, which the manager will wearily entertain and try to play down, but while it might be irritating to constantly hear, why not make a virtue of it? Last season, Palace dropped only four points in their final six games, elevating them from the vague threat of relegation to nearly cracking the top half of the table. In all of those games, Zaha essentially played up front on his own, a tactical choice initially made out of necessity, but nonetheless one that worked: Zaha scored five goals in those six games. This season Hodgson has tried a few different striking partners without much success, Christian Beneteke, Alexander Sorloth and Andrew Ayew not managing to summon a goal between them – so why not return to last spring and make Zaha their focal point again? NMJefferson Lerma was always going to be good value. The Colombian international has proved a fine signing for Bournemouth so far, so much so that he and Dan Gosling kept Lewis Cook out of the side until their last game. His all-round play has been excellent, but it must be of concern to Eddie Howe that Lerma might become s much a liability as an asset. The man at the heart of the Colombia team described by John Stones as the “dirtiest I’ve ever played against” during the World Cup has already lived up to his disciplinary billing since arriving on the south coast. Lerma, who was booked a whopping 19 times in 29 games for Levante last season already has three yellow cards in four games to his name, the latest coming after being at the centre of a last-minute scrap against Crystal Palace on Monday. A little physicality is always welcome in the Premier League, but Lerma isn’t much use to Howe if he’s suspended, which he will be frequently if he carries on like this.

But as it blooms, everything else withers. By  Nicholas ShaxsonIn the 1990s, I was a correspondent for Reuters and the Financial Times in Angola, a country rich with oil and diamonds that was being torn apart by a murderous civil war. Every western visitor asked me a version of the same question: how could the citizens of a country with vast mineral wealth be so shockingly destitute?One answer was corruption: a lobster-eating, champagne-drinking elite was getting very rich in the capital while their impoverished compatriots slaughtered each other out in the dusty provinces. Another answer was that the oil and diamond industries were financing the war. But neither of these facts told the whole story.There was something else going on. Around this same time, economists were beginning to put together a new theory about what was troubling countries like Angola. They called it the resource curse.Academics had worked out that many countries with abundant natural resources seemed to suffer from slower economic growth, more corruption, more conflict, more authoritarian politics and more poverty than their peers with fewer resources. (Some mineral-rich countries, including Norway, admittedly seem to have escaped the curse.) Crucially, this poor performance wasn’t only because powerful crooks stole the money and stashed it offshore, though that was also true. The startling idea was that all this money flowing from natural resources could make their people even worse off than if the riches had never been discovered. More money can make you poorer: that is why the resource curse is also sometimes known as the Paradox of Poverty from Plenty.Back in the 1990s, John Christensen was the official economic adviser to the British tax haven of Jersey. While I was writing about the resource curse in Angola, he was reading about it, and noticing more and more parallels with what he was seeing in Jersey. A massive financial sector on the tiny island was making a visible minority filthy rich, while many Jerseyfolk were suffering extreme hardship. But he could see an even more powerful parallel: the same thing was happening in Britain. Christensen left Jersey and helped set up the Tax Justice Network, an organisation that fights against tax havens. In 2007, he contacted me, and we began to study what we called the finance curse.It may seem bizarre to compare wartorn Angola with contemporary Britain, but it turned out that the finance curse had more parallels with the resource curse than we had first imagined. For one thing, in both cases the dominant sector sucks the best-educated people out of other economic sectors, government, civil society and the media, and into high-salaried oil or finance jobs. “Finance literally bids rocket scientists away from the satellite industry,” in the words of a landmark academic study of how finance can damage growth. “People who might have become scientists, who in another age dreamt of curing cancer or flying people to Mars, today dream of becoming hedge-fund managers.”In Angola, the cascading inflows of oil wealth raised the local price levels of goods and services, from housing to haircuts. This high-price environment caused another wave of destruction to local industry and agriculture, which found it ever harder to compete with imported goods. Likewise, inflows of money into the City of London (and money created in the City of London) have had a similar effect on house prices and on local price levels, making it harder for British exporters to compete with foreign competitors.Oil booms and busts also had a disastrous effect in Angola. Cranes would festoon the Luanda skyline in good times, then would leave a residue of half-finished concrete hulks when the bust came. Massive borrowing in the good times and a buildup of debt arrears in the bad times magnified the problem. In Britain’s case, the booms and busts of finance are differently timed and mostly caused by different things. But just as with oil booms, in good times the dominant sector damages alternative economic sectors, but when the bust comes, the destroyed sectors are not easily rebuilt.To argue that the City hurts Britain’s economy might seem crazy. But research increasingly shows that all the money swirling around our oversized financial sector may actually be making us collectively poorer. As Britain’s economy has steadily become re-engineered towards serving finance, other parts of the economy have struggled to survive in its shadow, like seedlings starved of light and water under the canopy of a giant, deep-rooted and invasive tree. Generations of leaders from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair to Theresa May have believed that the City is the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, to be prioritised, pampered and protected. But the finance curse analysis shows an oversized City to be a different bird: a cuckoo in the nest, crowding out other sectors.We all need finance. We need it to pay our bills, to help us save for retirement, to redirect our savings to businesses so they can invest, to insure us against unforeseen calamities, and also sometimes for speculators to sniff out new investment opportunities in our economy. We need finance – but this tells us nothing about how big our financial centre should be or what roles it should serve.A growing body of economic research confirms that once a financial sector grows above an optimal size and beyond its useful roles, it begins to harm the country that hosts it. The most obvious source of damage comes in the form of financial crises – including the one we are still recovering from a decade after the fact. But the problem is in fact older, and bigger. Long ago, our oversized financial sector began turning away from supporting the creation of wealth, and towards extracting it from other parts of the economy. To achieve this, it shapes laws, rules, thinktanks and even our culture so that they support it. The outcomes include lower economic growth, steeper inequality, distorted markets, spreading crime, deeper corruption, the hollowing-out of alternative economic sectors and more.Newly published research makes a first attempt to assess the scale of the damage to Britain. According to a new paper by Andrew Baker of the University of Sheffield, Gerald Epstein of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Juan Montecino of Columbia University, an oversized City of London has inflicted a cumulative £4.5tn hit on the British economy from 1995-2015. That is worth around two-and-a-half years’ economic output, or £170,000 per British household. The City’s claims of jobs and tax benefits are washed away by much, much bigger harms.This £2.7tn is added to the £1.8tn, checking carefully for overlap or double-counting, to make £4.5tn. This is a first rough approximation for how much additional GDP Britons might have enjoyed if the City had been smaller, and serving its traditional useful roles. (A third, £700bn category of “excess profits” and “excess remuneration” accruing to financial players has been excluded, to be conservative.)From the 1970s onwards, finance broke decisively free of these controls, taxes were slashed and swathes of our economies were privatised. And our businesses began to undergo a dramatic transformation: their core purposes were whittled down, through ideological shifts and changes in laws and rules, to little more than a single-minded focus on maximising the wealth of shareholders, the owners of those companies. Managers often found that the best way to maximise the owners’ wealth was not to make better widgets and sprockets or to find new cures for malaria, but to indulge in the sugar rush of financial engineering, to tease out more profits from businesses that are already doing well. Social purpose be damned. As all this happened, inequality rose, financial crises became more common and economic growth fell, as managers started focusing their attentions in all the wrong places. This was misallocation, again, but the more precise term for this transformation of business and the rise of finance is “financialisation”.The best-known definition of the term comes from the American economist Gerald Epstein, a co-author of the new study cited above: financialisation is “the increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and international economies”. In other words, it is not just that financial institutions and credit have puffed up spectacularly in size since the 1970s, but also that more normal companies such as beermakers, media groups or online rail ticket services, are being “financialised”, to extract maximum wealth for their owners.Take private equity firms, for instance. They typically buy up a solid company then financially engineer that company to squeeze all its different stakeholders, one by one. They run the company’s financial operations through tax havens, fleecing taxpayers. They may squeeze workers’ pay and pensions pots, or delay paying suppliers. They might buy up several companies to dominate a market niche, then milk customers for monopoly profits. They chisel the pension funds that invest alongside them, with hidden fees. And so on.Or, consider the financial structure of Trainline, the online rail ticket seller. When you buy a ticket, you may pay a small booking fee, perhaps 75p. After leaving your bank account, that 75p takes an extraordinary financial journey. It starts with London-based Trainline Limited, then flows up to another company that owns the first, called Trainline Holdings Limited. That company is owned by another, which is owned by another and so on.Five companies up and your brave little 75p skips off to the tax haven of Jersey, then back again to London, where it passes through five more companies, then back to Jersey, then over to Luxembourg, another tax haven. Higher up still, it passes through three or more impenetrable companies in the Cayman Islands, then joins a multitude of other rivulets and streams entering the US, where, 20 or so companies after starting, it flows to KKR, a giant US investment firm.It flows onwards, to KKR’s shareholders, including banks, investment funds and billionaires. KKR owns or part-owns more than 180 real, solid companies including the car-sharing firm Lyft, Sonos audio systems and Trainline. But on top of those 180 real firms, KKR has at least 4,000 corporate entities, including more than 800 in the Cayman Islands, links in snaking chains of entities with peculiar names drawn from finance’s arcane lingo, like (in Trainline’s case) Trainline Junior Mezz Limited or Victoria Investments Intermediate Holdco Limited.This is an invisible financial superstructure, siphoning wealth from Trainline’s genuinely useful and profitable services, upwards, away and offshore. None of this is remotely illegal. In our age of financialisation, this is increasingly how business is done.In 2012, Boris Johnson, then the mayor of London, stood under an umbrella by a busy road, his blond hair whiffling in the wind. “A pound spent in Croydon is far more of value to the country from a strict utilitarian calculus than a pound spent in Strathclyde,” he gushed. “Indeed you will generate jobs and growth in Strathclyde far more effectively if you invest in Hackney or Croydon or in other parts of London.”We are back to the idea of London as the engine of the economy. Is he right? Will pampering Croydon, London and south-east England generate wealth that can then be spread out to “Strathclyde”, Scotland and the regions? Or is London the centre of a financialising machine that sucks power and money away from the peripheries? Can an oversized City of London and the rest of Britain prosper alongside each other? Or, for the regions to prosper, must the City of London be humbled? This is perhaps the defining economic question of our times. It is a question ultimately bigger than Brexit.The newly published research provides part of the answer it suggests that the power of London finance is hurting Britain, to the tune of £4.5tn.But let’s take a more fine-grained look. If Johnson thinks money flows from Croydon to “Strathclyde” (a Scottish administrative region, now abolished) he may wish to ponder the Strathclyde Police Training and Recruitment Centre, built by the construction firm Balfour Beatty and opened in 2002 under the now-notorious private finance initiative. Under PFI, instead of the government building and paying for projects such as schools or hospitals directly, they get private firms to borrow the money in the City to finance their construction, under a deal that the government will pay them back over, say, 25 years, with interest and extra goodies. (Cynics see PFI as an expensive way for successive governments to hide their borrowing and spending, by outsourcing it all to the private sector.)The training centre (now called simply the Police Scotland Training Centre) sits underneath a corporate latticework nearly as complex as Trainline’s. PFI payments flow from the government to a private special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Strathclyde Limited Partnership then flow upwards from it through 10 or so companies or partnerships, to a £2bn Guernsey-based firm called International Public Partnerships Limited (INPP), then onwards via tangled shareholdings, partnerships, banking and lending arrangements, and lawyers and accountants clipping fees along the way, to other people and firms in London, South Africa, New York, Texas, Jersey, Munich, Ontario and more. The pipework is complex but the overall pattern is clear. Money flows from police budgets in Scotland, up through these financialised pipelines and into the City, posh parts of London and the south-east and offshore. Along the way, profits are being made and distributed and tax is avoided.But there is a bigger issue than tax here. Treasury data shows that while the police training centre cost £17-18m to build, the flow of payments to the PFI consortium will add up to £112m from 2001 to 2026, well over six times as much, and vastly more than what the government would have spent if it had simply borrowed that much itself and paid Balfour Beatty directly to build it. This fits a wider pattern. The 700-odd PFI schemes in Britain had an estimated capital value of less than £59.1bn in 2017, yet taxpayers will end up paying out more than £308bn for them, well over five times that sum. PFI is a gift to the City which has resulted in, as the PFI expert Allyson Pollock acidly put it, “one hospital for the price of two”.I have looked at several PFI corporate structures: each has a similarly convoluted financial architecture, and each involves a rain of payments from British regions (including poorer parts of London) into this central-London-focused financial nexus, overseas and offshore. And PFI is just one component of a larger picture. About £240bn, a third of the UK government’s annual budget, now goes on privately run but taxpayer-funded public services, most of it run through similarly financialised, London-focused pipelines.On this evidence, Johnson’s picture of money flowing from Croydon to Strathclyde has it exactly back to front. These are examples of what the late geographer Doreen Massey called the “colonial relationship” between parts of London and the rest of the country. To visualise what is going on, I like to imagine old white men in top hats manipulating a Heath-Robinson-like contraption of spindly pipework perched on top of the economy, vacuuming up coins and notes and IOUs from the pockets of those underneath: the workers and users of private care homes, sexual abuse referral centres, schools, hospitals, prisons – and, of course, those of us paying mortgages on expensive homes. All are unconsciously paying tribute into this great invisible extractive machinery.It is true, of course, that a chunk of the City’s money comes from overseas, so is not extracted from Britain. That at least must be a net benefit, surely? Not so. The core value of finance to our economy comes not from the jobs and billionaires it creates, but from the services it provides. Bringing in enormous quantities of overseas wealth doesn’t provide useful services for the British economy – but it does increase the power and wealth of the finance sector, contributing to the brain drain, the economic crises, the crashing productivity, the predatory attitudes, the misdirected lending and the subsequent inequality. Our open arms to the world’s dirty money is corrupting our politics, and it is puffing up our housing markets, penalising the young, the poor and the weak. It is all deepening the finance curse.Finance is a great geographical sorting machine, iding us into offshore winners and onshore losers. But it is also a sorting machine for race, gender, disability and vulnerability – taking value from those suffering reduced public services or wage cuts, and from groups made up disproportionately of women, non-white people, the elderly and the vulnerable – and delivering it to the City. It is a generational sorting machine too, as PFI, risky shadow banking profits and financialised games help the winners to jam today, with the bills sent to our kids.This hidden tide of money flows constantly from the tired, the weak, the vulnerable huddled masses across Britain, up through these invisible filigree pipelines to a relatively small number of white European or North American men in Mayfair, Chelsea, Jersey, Geneva, the Caymans or New York. This is the finance curse in action. And it’s nice work if you can get it.Why can’t we do something about the overwhelming power of finance? Why are the protests so muted? Why can’t we tax, regulate or police City institutions properly?We can’t, and we don’t, not just because the City’s money talks so loudly, but also because of an ideology that has bamboozled us into thinking that we must be “competitive”. The City is going head to head with other financial centres around the world, they cry, and if we are to stay ahead in this race, we cannot hold it back with tough regulations, clod-hopping police snooping around, or “uncompetitive” tax rates. Otherwise, all that money will whoosh off to Geneva or Hong Kong. After Brexit, it will be even more urgent to stay competitive.“We must be competitive” – it sounds great, right? Tony Blair embraced this concept, even before he slammed the Financial Services Authority in 2005, saying it was seen as “hugely inhibiting of efficient business by perfectly respectable companies that have never defrauded anyone”. David Cameron bowed down to this competitiveness agenda when he declared that “We are in a global race today... Sink or swim. Do or decline.” Theresa May reiterated the idea last month when she declared that Britain would be “unequivocally pro-business” with the lowest corporate tax rate among G20 countries.Many people in Britain, it is true, are ambivalent about all this. They rightly fret that the City is a global money-laundering paradise, harming other nations, but (whisper it quietly) they like the hot money and oligarchs it attracts to our shores. There is a trade-off, they think, between doing the right thing and preserving our prosperity. Some do understand that if other countries follow suit with this competitiveness agenda, a race to the bottom ensues, leading to ever-lower corporate taxes, laxer financial regulation, greater secrecy, looser controls on financial crime and so on. The only answer to a race to the bottom, they gloomily conclude, is to agree some sort of multilateral armistice to get countries to co-operate and collaborate in not doing this stuff. But that is like herding squirrels on a trampoline: each country wants to out-compete the others, so there will be cheating on any deal. And it is hard to mobilise voters on this complex, distant global stuff. So, they sigh, we are stuck in this ugly race to the bottom.But there is some tremendous good news here: these people are all flat wrong. The competitiveness agenda, driving us into this race, is intellectual nonsense resting on elementary fallacies, lazy assumptions and confusions. And this is for a few simple reasons. For one thing, economies, tax systems and cities are nothing like companies, and don’t compete like we might think. To get a taste of this, ponder the difference between a failed company, such as Carillion, and a failed state, such as Syria. Even more to the point, the finance curse shows us that if too much finance harms your economy, then pursuing more finance through the competitiveness agenda will make things worse.Underpinning all this is the fallacy of composition, whereby the fortunes of our big businesses and big banks are conflated with the fortunes of our whole economy. Making HSBC or RBS more globally competitive, the thinking goes, will make Britain more competitive. But to the extent that their profits are extracted from other parts of the British economy, their success hurts Britain more than it helps.What could Britain do with that £16bn? We could simultaneously run nine Oxford Universities, double the resources of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, treble government cybersecurity resources, and double staff numbers at HMRC, the tax authorities. Or we could send nearly half a million kids to Eton each year, if you could fit them all in. Does this trade-off somehow make Britain’s tax system, or Britain itself, more competitive? Of course not.Corporate tax cuts are in fact just one of many varieties of goodies that we shower on the mobile financiers and multinationals. The same basic arguments hold in other areas, too. Better financial regulation brings benefits, while also scaring away the wealth-extracting predators. It is a win-win. There is no trade-off.Words such as competitiveness and related terms (such as the even more fatuous UK Plc) are wielded to trick millions of taxpayers into thinking that it is in their own self-interest to hand over goodies – tax cuts, financial deregulation, tolerance for monopolies, turning a blind eye to crime and more – to large multinationals and financial institutions. We are permanently at a tipping point, we are told: all that investment is about to disappear down a gurgling global plughole unless we cut taxes and deregulate, NOW, I tell you.We need investment that is embedded in the local economy, bringing jobs, skills and long-term engagement, where managers send their kids to local schools and the business supports an ecosystem of local supply chains. This is the golden stuff, and if an investment is nicely embedded, a whiff of tax won’t scare it away (even if Brexit might). Any investor who is more sensitive to tax has, almost by definition, shallower roots. So taxes will tend to discourage the flightier, more predatory, more financialised investors, who bring fewer jobs and local linkages, and higher corporate tax revenues pay for ingredients that attract investors: roads, police forces, courts, and the educated and healthy workers. To prosper, Britain should increase its effective corporate tax rates, at least for financiers and large multinationals.Of course, you could also argue that the best way to become more competitive would be for a country to invest in and upgrade education or infrastructure, control dangerous capital flows across borders, manage the exchange rate, or carefully target industrial policies to nurture productive domestic economic ecosystems. You could insist that something called “national competitiveness” must meet the test of productivity, good jobs and a broad-based rise in living standards. There are respectable arguments along all these lines.But these are not the visions that Blair, Cameron, May, Trump and other finance-captured leaders have been pushing. Their competitiveness agenda is about pursuing rootless global capital in a dog-eat-dog world. Give big banks and multinationals the goodies, and look the other way when they behave badly, in the craven and pathetic hope that they won’t run away.Any country engaging in a race to the bottom on this stuff also needs to understand that the race does not stop when tax rates reach zero. There is literally no limit to the extent to which corporate players and the wealthy wish to free-ride off the taxes paid by the rest of us. Eliminate their taxes, appease them, and they will demand other subsidies, like the playground bully. Why wouldn’t they?And yet your local car wash, your barber, or your last surviving neighbourhood fruit-and-veg merchant can’t credibly threaten to jump to Monaco if they don’t like their tax rates or fruit hygiene regulations. The agenda favours the mobile big players with handouts, leaving the domestic small fry to pay the full price of civilisation – plus a surcharge to cover the roaming members of the billionaire classes who won’t. The agenda systematically shifts wealth upwards from poor to rich, distorting our economies, reducing growth and undermining our democracies. It is always harmful.The competitiveness agenda is a billionaire-friendly hoax. Most competent economists know this already. “If we can teach undergraduates to wince when they hear someone talk about competitiveness, we will have done our nation a great service,” the US economist Paul Krugman explained in a 1993 paper. “A government wedded to the ideology of competitiveness,” he later added, “is as unlikely to make good economic policy as a government committed to creationism is to make good science policy.”So the competitiveness agenda is an intellectual house of cards, ready to fall. If we can topple it, we can tackle the finance curse. It is pretty straightforward, in fact. In the 1983 movie War Games, a computer geek hacks into the US Department of Defense’s supercomputer and gets dragged into a game of strategy called Global Thermonuclear War. As the game merges with reality, the machine races through thousands of scenarios before concluding: “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.” Britain is in the same position. By joining this “competitive” global race we have not only been beggaring others – we have been beggaring ourselves, too. We can, and we must, simply step out of the race, unilaterally. That last word, unilaterally, is key. We can just stop it. This is a race for losers.We need not bow down to the demands of monopolists, foreign oligarchs, tax-haven operators, wealth-extracting private equity moguls, too-big-to-jail banks, or PFI milkers. We can tax, regulate and police our financial sector as we ought to. Global coordination and cooperation are worth doing where possible, but we need not wait for it. And by appealing to national self-interest, we can mobilise the biggest constituency of all, and put finance back in its rightful place: serving Britain’s people, not served by them.Adapted from The Finance Curse: How Global Finance Is Making Us All Poorer by Nicholas Shaxson, published by Vintage on 11 October and available from bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1370bb0003774c3e34de01fc448cc5e06a93f04/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087bba64ca4ad9521c8bd8a2693cd0e2","title":"meet some of the women succeeding in stem","story":"There are women with flourishing science and technology careers, but work is needed to make this the norm rather than the exception. Here, industry leaders explain the importance of breaking through stereotypes and giving support and mentorship to the next generation of female Stem talentBut how do you bust the myth that Stem careers are only for the boys? And how do we nurture the next generation of female Stem talent?“I wish it wasn’t true, but I think gender stereotyping still plays a big part in deterring women from entering Stem,” says Dr Sian Morris, associate director for scientific communications at P\u0026ampG. A veteran of the company, Morris joined P\u0026ampG in 1992, and since then has worked in a plethora of roles, including developing cosmetics that are still on sale today, and working in the consumer understanding team to gain insight into who buys P\u0026ampG products across the globe. It’s been a erse and varied career, and one that has enabled Morris to gain a huge range of professional experiences. But Morris believes that many young girls might be deterred from enjoying a creative and fulfilling career like hers, due to the gendered expectations we instil in young girls. “There’s this idea of ‘pink jobs’ and ‘blue jobs’ that still exists,” she says. “It starts early in life, and if it’s nurtured in the classroom, then girls opt out of Stem.” It’s critical, Morris argues, to challenge the false expectation girls often have that boys are simply better at Stem. “Some girls simply self-deselect. Girls and women are naturally tough on ourselves, and that, combined with having to fight for airtime in a boy-dominated class, or being put down for your interests, can sometimes make you find a different path.”Of course, it’s not all about encouraging women to study Stem subjects at school and university: it’s also about helping them feel supported and nurtured in their career, and particularly helping them to navigate the challenges of having a family and working. Many of the women I speak to cite the importance of female mentors and role models early in their careers as pivotal to their success. “I’m lucky to have an inspirational mentor who provides great support and taught me the importance of making courageous choices, even when they’re unpopular,” explains Ilaria Ambrogio, principal scientist at P\u0026ampG. For senior IT manager Sinead Devine, being a woman in IT felt challenging, especially early on. “When I started, I was in the minority,” she remembers, “and I felt that even more when I had my first child, about four years into my career.” But Devine used that feeling of being one of the few, not the many, to help champion a better work-life balance for working parents at P\u0026ampG, with considerable success. “The number of female IT professionals is more balanced now, and there’s a better network to support women in all phases of their careers.”Some women still feel there’s a lot of unlearning you have to do to rise to the top as a woman in Stem, such as unlearning the social checks we place upon girls in adolescence that they carry throughout their adult lives: aim high, but not too high be successful, but never boast avoid confrontation or handle challenging situations by trying to please people, rather than forging your own path. These gendered norms may impede some women from achieving their full potential in Stem careers – which is why they need to be unlearned.“I’ve grown in confidence in my ability to have true leadership, which isn’t a quality I had when I was at college,” Devine explains. “I’ve learned to hold my own in more challenging situations, and not just to be louder than anyone else, but to be more strategic and really drive decisions.”What advice would these industry leaders give to young women looking to get into Stem? “Be receptive to new possibilities and break through stereotypes,” urges Ursula Heng of P\u0026ampG’s beauty delivery engineering ision. “If you’re encountering prejudice, educate others, but above all – find your voice.” Also, stay true to yourself. “Women are still a minority in Stem,” Heng acknowledges, “but that doesn’t mean you have to be someone else in order to thrive. P\u0026ampG is a great company to work for, because it genuinely values ersity, and that enables everyone to bring their true self to work.”Even though there are as many Stem careers as there are elements in the periodic table, many girls may continue to view the industry in terms of narrow stereotypes. “There’s this idea that a career in Stem means you’re either a white coat-wearing laboratory scientist, an engineer in overalls and a hard hat, or a slightly eccentric academic professor,” Heng says. “But there are many instances of engineers and scientists working in completely different environments on a range of applications that affect every aspect of our lives: digitisation, weather patterns, or transport systems. They are very important, fabulous, and extremely relevant!” Thankfully, things are changing. One recent study found that more women have entered Stem in the past 40 years than any other field. But further work needs to be done to help encourage these women to stay in the industry, grow, and support and nurture the next generation of female talent. Still, when reflecting on the next generation of young, female students, Morris feels ebullient.“They are enthusiastic, energetic, curious, fun, and eager to translate their passion for science and engineering into careers,” she says. “Now we just need to make sure that when girls do have that spark of interest in Stem, we foster it and fan it into a flame and keep it burning bright.”Many companies support programmes that see Stem ambassadors visit schools to help highlight the opportunities available and encourage young girls and children to explore a Stem career.

Here, LGBTQ+ employees detail their experiences and explain what can be done to improve inclusivityFor many, “coming out” is a slight misnomer. The phrase implies one definitive act – you’re in the closet, and then you leave it – whereas the reality can often be more nuanced. Coming out as gay, lesbian, bi or trans isn’t a one-off event: it’s something that can happen dozens of times. Perhaps you first come out to a friend, then a parent, and then your wider circle, before finally plucking up the courage to tell your gran (who says she’s always known, before carrying on with her Sudoku – if you’re lucky).Coming out at work can be an even more protracted process. The average person changes jobs 10 to 15 times in a working lifetime, and that’s without factoring in an ever-changing carousel of colleagues and clients. It’s probably unnecessary to announce your gender identity and sexuality to every contractor, freelancer and intern you encounter, but at some point the subject is bound to come up. Since most people are assumed to be cisgender (those whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth) and heterosexual, how does it feel to tell your workmates otherwise?Vijay Sitlani, 43, is the finance director of P\u0026ampG. Born in India he worked for the corporation in India and Singapore, where he felt it was very difficult for him to come out. When he moved to Geneva, his attitude became more relaxed within a more inclusive environment. By the time he transferred to the UK business in 2016, he felt comfortable coming out as gay to his entire team and started helping other LGBTQ+ employees find their courage. “You don’t just come out one day and then you’re out, it happens in small, baby steps,” he says. “When I worked in Singapore, there were only a handful of colleagues who knew that I was gay, and that was mostly for logistical reasons such as arranging visas for my partner. At P\u0026ampG, when someone from management introduced themselves to a team, they’d usually show a slide with a picture of themselves with their wife and children. My slides would always be about my career history and nothing else.“Then, when I came to the UK, I was aware that it was more liberal than the other countries I had worked in. It took great guts, but when it was time to introduce myself to my new team, I put up a slide that included a photograph of my partner, my dog and me. Nobody batted an eyelid, which felt like a big milestone for me.”Others have had less positive experiences. “When I first started working, I used to dread answering questions about my personal life,” says Ruth Holland, a 31-year-old producer and director. “The responses were always so predictable. People would say: ‘Oh, really, I had no idea you were a lesbian!’ I’d think: ‘Why would you have?’ Once a male colleague asked if I had a boyfriend, and when I told him I had a girlfriend, he said: ‘You’re not a lesbian, you’ve got long hair!’ I don’t think he was being malicious, but you could have heard a penny drop, and I’d have appreciated someone taking the heat off me and telling him he was being ridiculous. Other people would ask really personal questions, such as ‘How did you come out?’ or ‘How are you going to have a baby?’ They aren’t conversations that you necessarily want to have in big groups, or with people you’ve just met.”Shon Faye, 30, is a Bristol-based writer, artist and standup comedian, but originally trained as a solicitor. “After coming out as trans, I applied for a job as a solicitor paralegal, which I found quite difficult,” she says. “It was quite early in my transition, so I didn’t look particularly feminine, and I felt quite anxious to turn up to a job interview where they’d be expecting a cisgender woman. In the end I decided to mention the fact that I was trans on my cover letter, and once I got the job I was asked whether I wanted my team to be told.“Everyone was perfectly nice about it, but there were a few awkward moments where well-meaning colleagues got their pronouns wrong, and said things such as: ‘My uncle became my aunt and we all respect him.’” Despite law being regarded as a stereotypically conservative industry, Faye says: “I’ve actually had to deal with more transphobia since working in the media. For instance, a television producer asked me lots of intrusive questions about what hormones I was on. I think it’s because lawyers are petrified of being sued, which is quite healthy in a way. The media has a more informal atmosphere, which can lead to more problems.”Thankfully, things do appear to be improving. “Workplace cultures have changed a lot, even in the past 10 years,” says Holland. “There’s a lot more awareness about what’s appropriate to ask an LGBTQ+ person. It’s one reason I think it’s important to come out at work, because visibility makes a difference. The more commonplace LGBTQ+ people are, the less you feel defined by your sexuality, rather than being good at your job.”Sitlani’s experience of coming out was helped by the fact that P\u0026ampG has a GABLE (gay, ally, bisexual, lesbian and transgender employees) affinity group, which runs training sessions exploring how straight employees can be good LGBTQ+ allies. “P\u0026ampG are making a lot of headway in inclusivity culture,” he explains. “People wear a rainbow badge, or have stickers on their laptop, to openly show they are allies.”As for the advice he’d give anyone thinking about coming out at work? “There is no best way to come out,” says Sitlani. “It’s entirely up to the inidual and how they feel about it. Everyone is on their own journey and you have to do what makes you comfortable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/246aaef03fe649ff41d8bfbd9eb239210d4d6a90/0_0_5614_3369/master/5614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90c1638df6309cec6dcc5bf65fcc38e1","title":"green party calls for free time index to replace gdp measure","story":"Leaders Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley make first policy announcementThe Green party has called for GDP to be replaced as a measure of national wellbeing with an index showing how much free time people have to enjoy, arguing that leisure can contribute more to overall happiness than wealth.The policy, which followed a Green proposal for people to work a four-day week, will be unveiled on Friday by its new co-leaders, Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, at the party’s annual conference in Bristol.Under the plan, the so-called Free Time Index would measure how much leisure time people have, taking into account both work hours and their commute.It would be published once a year as part of the budget, with the aim that it should increase every 12 months.The idea – the first policy announcement since Berry and Bartley were elected by party members in September – is intended to both improve people’s work-life balance and move society away from a culture of long work hours, given the changing expectations around employment from new technology.Before the 2017 general election, the party called for the introduction of a formal four-day week as part of the same process, a proposal also backed last month by the TUC.It will be a first formal outing for the new leadership duo, who replace the previous pairing of Bartley and Caroline Lucas.Ahead of the automatic re-election process which all Green leaders and other top officials face every two years, Lucas announced she would not stand again, to focus on her work in Brighton Pavilion, where she is the party’s first MP.The aim was also to allow a new generation of senior figures to emerge, with Lucas having long been the party’s most recognised figurehead.In extracts from the leaders’ speech released in advance, Berry, who is a member of the London assembly and a councillor in Camden, said it was “time to shift away from the culture which sees us work harder and harder for longer and longer, often without reward or satisfaction, and to recognise that true freedom will only be found when people have more control of their time and how it is spent”.Bartley, who leads the Green opposition on Lambeth council in London, said the aim was to allow people “the time to have a family life, relax, and pursue the things they care about”.He said: “It should be an aim of the government to see a yearly increase in this Free Time Index, so that the quality of time which is truly our own becomes the real measure of wellbeing.”More widely, the three-day conference will see the Greens again press their claim as a radical political force following a difficult couple of years in which their poll ratings have been squeezed by the current two-party dominance, and by the perception Jeremy Corbyn has taken some of their territory.The Green leaders reject this, arguing that Labour remains cautious over many issues, including the environment and the idea of adapting to the new era of employment through initiatives like a universal basic income."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209eb936dcd10ec9d78680a48334453144dffcb8/0_339_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6652e12d0db6ac50355aefb8003384b","title":"irish pm urges theresa may uk publish brexit border plan","story":"Leo Varadkar says UK must not delay until right before crunch Brexit summit later this monthIreland’s prime minister has urged Theresa May to publish her revised Brexit border plan “as soon as possible” so the UK and EU can seal a Brexit deal in November.Leo Varadkar said the UK must not delay until a few days before a crunch summit on 17-18 October because the EU needed time to “respond to it in a meaningful way” if talks were to advance. “We want there to be decisive progress at the October summit, so that allows us to seal a deal in November,” he said.The Irish leader was speaking to journalists in between a series of meetings with EU leaders in Brussels, as exit talks enter a critical fortnight before the make-or-break October summit.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, piled pressure on the British government to strike a compromise and criticised the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for his “unwise and insulting” remarks comparing the EU with the Soviet Union.But in remarks that delighted hard Brexit enthusiasts, Tusk said the EU remained ready to offer the UK a “Canada-plus-plus-plus deal” – a far-reaching trade accord with extra agreements on security and foreign policy.Boris Johnson and other hard Brexit Tories seized on Tusk’s remarks, arguing they showed it was time for May to immediately switch tack and abandon her Chequers proposals for remaining in a customs union for food and goods. “Tusk’s Canada-plus-plus-plus offer shows there is a superb way forward that can solve the Irish border problem and deliver a free-trade-based partnership that works well for both sides of the channel,” Johnson said.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group, said Tusk’s offer was “a good solution for everyone”. The former Brexit secretary David Davis also seized on Tusk’s comments, saying they showed that “No 10’s claim that ‘there is no alternative to Chequers’ is just wrong. We could easily switch strategies to Canada-plus-plus-plus and deliver an outcome that is good for the UK, acceptable to parliament, and negotiable with Brussels.”Some Brexiters overlook that the EU’s version of a so-called Canada deal incorporates a guarantee to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, which would keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and single market. “Canada plus-plus-plus” is also a fuzzy concept that has no formal status in EU negotiating documents. Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, mentioned the idea in an interview with the  and other papers last year.“I don’t know what Canada-plus-plus-plus means, it is just a concept at this stage,” Varadkar said, adding that it did not negate the need for a “legally binding backstop” – a guarantee to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland if there is no agreement on the future trading relationship.With talks deadlocked over the backstop, the British government wants a temporary customs arrangement that would keep the whole of the UK in an EU customs union, but with the right to sign trade deals with other countries. Varadkar poured cold water on the UK’s proposals. The EU could not accept a situation, he said, where British companies had access to European markets but were able to outcompete European rivals by lowering labour, product or health and safety standards. “To do free trade you have to do fair trade as well,” Varadkar said in a nod to deep concerns on this issue that have been raised by France, the Netherlands and other member states.The taoiseach sounded a lukewarm note about another British backstop proposal, that the Stormont assembly would have to give consent to new EU regulations. “Those who are now putting a huge emphasis on the new for cross-community consent need to put in mind that cross-community consent was not sought for Brexit,” he said referring to Northern Ireland voting to remain.Varadkar’s day of visits – which included a meeting with Barnier – underscores that talks are intensifying after the lull of the party conference season.“We should get down to business,” said Tusk. In an implicit rebuke to May, who has accused the EU of not showing her respect, he said: “Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound attractive but they do not facilitate agreement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b242f807b375d137840a286ac35fbe2716c9739/0_63_3930_2357/master/3930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c6b075efca598527d231058b7955ec","title":"scottish labour leader sacks two msps in purge reshuffle","story":"Critics hit out at Richard Leonard’s removal of Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie as he calls for ‘focus on unity’Scottish Labour’s leader, Richard Leonard, has sacked two of his most experienced shadow cabinet colleagues in a reshuffle described as a “purge” by critics, and which appears to coincide with an ongoing row over the payment of former leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal fees.Anas Sarwar, who lost to Leonard following an ill-tempered leadership contest last autumn, was replaced as health spokesperson, while Jackie Baillie lost her role as economy spokesperson.  understands that Baillie, one of Scottish Labour’s longest serving MSPs, was sacked by phone. Sarwar revealed that he first learned of Leonard’s decision via social media.In a statement, Sarwar said that he was “deeply disappointed” to lose his health portfolio, adding: “It’s a shame that I came to know about this decision through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber.”Both Baillie and Sarwar offered their support to Dugdale after the UK Labour party withdrew its funding for her defence in a defamation action brought by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland blog, with Baillie calling on fellow MSPs to contribute to a fighting fund for their colleague.Campbell is suing Dugdale for £25,000 after she called one of his tweets “homophobic” in her Daily Record newspaper column, a claim that he denies.The UK party had previously paid for her representation in court but this week general secretary, Jennie Formby, said she had decided to stop after obtaining legal counsel that Dugdale faced “significant financial liability”. Formby also accused Dugdale of failing to thank the party for its financial support.Following the reshuffle, sources close to Baillie said: “Factionalism has won over competence. It’s disappointing as it would appear that a Labour party that has always been a broad church has now decided that factionalism is more important.”Ian Murray, MP for Edinburgh South and a long-standing Corbyn critic, tweeted: “The purge of good, capable and committed people goes on merely for standing up for what they believe in. I don’t know whether to be angry or sad. I thought Richard was better than this?”Leonard said that he had decided to “refresh” the shadow cabinet in order to “focus on unity and the public, not ourselves and internal battles”.Sarwar’s role will now be filled by leftwinger Monica Lennon, a Corbyn supporter who has distinguished herself as an equalities campaigner since she was first elected in 2016. Leonard will cover the economy brief himself.Neil Findlay, who acted as Corbyn’s leadership campaign manager in Scotland, will take on the key role of Labour chief whip at Holyrood, while the former party deputy Alex Rowley will return to cabinet as local government spokesperson.Rowley resigned from the frontbench last year after a former partner accused him of stalking and harassment following the breakdown of their relationship, allegations that he denied. A party investigation was subsequently dropped because the woman did not want Rowley to read the full details of her complaint.Earlier on Thursday, Scottish Labour’s head of communications, Charlie Mann, resigned after less than six months in post, stating that he had “decided the role is not for me”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60cf75b5bcc46c7391321eb90f7951a741518720/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec8e210ee7873274fe89b0f6668f085a","title":"vitamin d supplements dont help bone health major study concludes","story":"Biggest ever review of evidence recommends the government ditch its advice to take them throughout winterVitamin D supplements do nothing for bone health and the government should ditch its advice that everyone should take them throughout the winter months, according to the authors of the biggest review of the evidence ever carried out.The findings challenge the established view of vitamin D and will dismay the many people who believe a daily dose of it is doing them good. But the large meta-analysis, the authors of which compiled 81 separate studies to come to the most robust possible conclusions, found there was no evidence to justify taking vitamin D supplements for bone health, except for those at high risk of a few rare conditions.The Department of Health currently says everyone should consider taking a vitamin D supplement for their bone health in the winter months, between October and March, if they cannot get enough by exposure to sunlight. That includes all infants and children from six months to five years. It is based on findings from the government’s scientific advisory committee on nutrition (SACN) in July 2016, which did not conclude there were other proven health benefits.The new meta-analysis is published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal and led by the longstanding experts on vitamin D Profs Mark Bolland and Andrew Grey from the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Prof Alison Avenell of Aberdeen University.Bolland said things have changed since 2014, when the last major review of the evidence was carried out. In the last four years, “more than 30 randomised controlled trials on vitamin D and bone health have been published, nearly doubling the evidence base available,” he said.“Our meta-analysis finds that vitamin D does not prevent fractures, falls or improve bone mineral density, whether at high or low dose.”He said the advice given by doctors and government health departments around the world recommending vitamin D and saying it is helpful in osteoporosis or brittle bone disease, which afflicts older people, should now be altered. “Clinical guidelines should be changed to reflect these findings,” he said.He said further trials looking at the effects of vitamin D on bone health would be pointless. “On the strength of existing evidence, we believe there is little justification for more trials of vitamin D supplements looking at musculoskeletal outcomes,” he said.Everybody needs vitamin D the question is whether we should get it from supplements. It is made in the body naturally as a result of exposure to sunlight, which is why people living in northern climates and those who cover up their skin may have lower levels than they should. It is also contained in a small number of foods, such as cod liver oil, offal, egg yolk and oily fish including salmon and mackerel.The studies that have been done are mostly in older people who could be at risk of osteoporosis (brittle bone disease), but Avenell said there is no evidence of benefit for any adults – apart from those few who are at high risk of osteomalacia, a form of rickets in adults.“I do think they should change the guidance,” she said. “We don’t think that the population needs to take vitamin D supplementation, because trials don’t show it has any benefit in protecting against falls and fractures or all the other things vitamin D is supposed to protect you against.They were not talking about the effects of supplements in children and young people, she said, because there had not been trials. They were also very clear, she said, that people who were never exposed to the sun because they covered themselves up or were institutionalised were at risk of vitamin D deficiency.“The context for this analysis lies in the fact that many patients (and doctors) have been persuaded by various studies and social media that vitamin D is a cure-all,” said J Chris Gallagher of the Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha, USA, in a linked comment in the journal.“This thinking is reminiscent of the fervour that supported the widespread use of vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E years ago, and all of those vitamin trials later proved to be clinically negative.“The authors should be complimented on an important updated analysis on musculoskeletal health, but already I can hear the fervent supporters – what about the extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D?”According to the SACN, there have been suggestions that vitamin D can help with a number of other “extra-skeletal” health issues, including cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, infectious diseases, neuropsychological functioning, oral health and age-related macular degeneration, although the did not find convincing evidence for any of these. Gallagher believes studies now taking place will answer those questions.“Within three years we might have that answer because there are approximately 100,000 participants currently enrolled in randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation,” he wrote. “I look forward to those studies giving us the last word on vitamin D.”Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, maintained that people should continue to take supplements. “With a fifth of people in the UK showing concerning vitamin D levels, government advice is to achieve this from sunshine and a healthy balanced diet during summer and spring,” he said. “During autumn and winter, those not consuming foods naturally containing or fortified with vitamin D should consider a 10 microgram supplement.”Martin Hewison, professor of molecular endocrinology at the University of Birmingham, agreed, adding that many trials for vitamin D supplementation have shown it is only effective if iniduals are vitamin D-deficient to begin with – but that in this research very few participants started off with low levels of vitamin D.“What the current study illustrates,” he said, “is that more studies are required that target vitamin D supplementation where it is needed – in people with vitamin D deficiency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a14368a7f556935a32fc8e0b36451ff0f0296cb/0_216_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858d20bdfa4ece0438948d26ef8bb104","title":"ufc 229 preview conor mcgregor khabib","story":"The UFC’s star problem will be forgotten, for one night at least, as Conor McGregor makes his long-awaited octagon returnDana White wasn’t certain this day would ever come.At times he was pretty confident it\u0026nbspwouldn’t. After all, Conor McGregor just struck it rich. Sure, he was\u0026nbspalready\u0026nbspwhat any common person would deem wealthy from his prior fighting exploits.As UFC’s biggest star, McGregor was routinely earning millions. The last time he entered the octagon – a second-round knockout of Eddie Alvarez in November 2016 – the Irishman raked in a guaranteed $3m that soared past five when pay-per-view upside was calculated.But when he crossed over into boxing for a megafight with Floyd Mayweather last summer, he banked an eight-figure payday.So the mere sight of the sport’s biggest attraction once again sitting on the dais two days before a major fight brought a smile to the UFC president’s face Thursday.“When a guy makes $100m, you don’t know if he’s ever gonna fight again. Conor made a lot of money and I’m sure he had a lot of fun and did what he wanted to do,” White said. “No matter how much you make, you can only sit home for so long and you start to go crazy.”McGregor didn’t just sit at home, though. And he\u0026nbspdid\u0026nbspgo crazy. He made an unexpected appearance at UFC 223 media day in April and proceeded to project a handtruck at a bus transporting many of his fellow fighters, including Khabib Nurmagomedov.The dolly was actually aimed at Nurmagomedov, whom McGregor will meet Saturday at UFC 229 at T-Mobile Arena. Nurmagomedov was involved in a dustup with McGregor’s buddy, Artem Lobov, earlier that week, sending the Notorious One into a rage.The fracas resulted in several injuries, many fight cancellations and a bevy of lawsuits. He was arrested and charged with three counts of assault. At the time, White casted doubt on McGregor’s status in UFC moving forward.“Do you want to be in business with Conor McGregor right now?” White asked in April immediately following the incident. “Do you want to chase this guy around for interviews and buy his fights? Do you?“I don’t think anybody is going to want to right now. I think everybody is going to be pretty disgusted with Conor McGregor right now. Listen, you don’t like Khabib and you don’t like what happened or whatever? Then fight Khabib.”McGregor is doing just that, and the act White once called “criminal, disgusting, despicable,” is now being used as a promotional vehicle – in video highlights and other materials – to hype the highly anticipated showdown. That’s show business.Since the advent of sanctioned prized fighting in the 1800s, promoters have used any available tool – both real and imagined – to sell tickets. White can’t be blamed for changing his tune just a few months later.So yes, White indeed\u0026nbspdoes\u0026nbspwant to be in business with Conor McGregor. He’s not just the most recognizable name in UFC, but in combat sports as a whole.“You can tell this guy is passionate about fighting,” White said. “He loves it. He loves breaking records and he loves making money.”And money he shall make. White projects the event could surpass 3m pay-per-view buys, which would shatter the previous record set by who else? McGregor, whose rematch victory over Nate Diaz in 2016 generated 1.65m buys.With all the legitimate bad blood swirling between both camps, and a tantalizing matchup, maybe White’s prediction will prove right. McGregor is actually the underdog this time. Oddsmakers at Bovada peg Khabib as a slight favorite at minus-160 to McGregor’s plus-130.The 30-year-old Russian is undefeated and hungry. He also matches up well with McGregor as a highly skilled wrestler who finds way to score takedowns time and again.McGregor, 30, is at his best when he’s on his feet and able to deliver his pulverizing strikes. Following an eight-week training camp to prepare for Mayweather and nine-plus rounds that followed in the ring, Mystic Mac’s boxing ability figures to be much-improved.But he must contend with a two-year layoff from the sport he’s actually participating in, and a hungry, determined opponent who is looking to etch his name in lore.\u0026nbsp“I think beginning of first round I have to be careful with him because he has good boxing but my wrestling is my pressure,” Nurmagomedov said Thursday. “He has to kill me to stop me. I’m going to finish this guy and stop this guy and this is my plan.”That was the nature of McGregor’s threats. At various times Thursday he vowed to “knock that man’s nose into the nose bleeds,” and “put a hole in this man’s head”.“I do not give a fuck. I’m ruthless here. I’m here to put a hole in this man’s skull,” McGregor promised. “I’m starving for this man’s head.”Khabib possesses the superior grappling ability, and McGregor has tapped out once before (first meeting with Diaz in 2016 when he submitted to a rear-naked chokehold.) Bravado and violent taunts aside, McGregor has a plan.“I’ve been grappling and wrestling much heavier man this whole camp. 200-pounders, 25 minutes straight,” McGregor said. “I am ready for all outcomes. I feel once I hit him he’s going to turn weak. I expect panic in him early.“I also don’t give a bollocks. I’ve experienced it all. I’ve gotten fucking tired in there. I’ve been on my back in there. I’ve been in every scenario you can be in under the brightest lights in the entire world. I am a veteran. I am here to enjoy this because this is what I love.”Enjoy McGregor now, because win or lose, who knows if or when he’ll be back. He was noncommittal to fighting again after Saturday. And this is\u0026nbspbefore\u0026nbsphe’ll earn another pile of money that promises to rank as the best payday of his UFC career.With Ronda Rousey gone, the UFC is short on stars, but for now, White has his brightest. Now he needs Conor to not just win, but stick around for a while.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591de11917cc948a96289b6d2ec3942578b852aa/405_473_5020_3012/master/5020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2699aaed71d604f09b1eff626f3197","title":"i was welling up teachers report on their school of rock students","story":"The child stars of the West End musical rock out in a band assembled by Dewey Finn, who poses as a supply teacher. What do their own teachers make of the hit show?What can teachers learn from Dewey Finn? It’s all about organised chaos. One hundred years ago, a classroom was 30 desks with students sitting behind them and a chalkboard in front of them. Now, the majority of school life is exactly the same. I try to change that and so does Dewey – albeit to an extreme!I’m Samuelle’s head of year. We have a sound system at school that I have blaring for upbeat vibes in PE lessons, things like house music to keep the kids going. I use ACDC’s Thunderstruck for fitness exercises: they have to do a press-up every time the band shout “thunderstruck”. That’s a lot of press-ups.It’s not the biggest theatre in the world, but the way the show is designed, and the intimate nature of the staging, makes you feel close to the action. Samuelle plays Mason, who becomes the band’s tech and is a bit of a cheeky chap, much like Samuelle himself. I’ve got friends who are actors and this is their life but for these children it’s different. They have a full day of being a normal kid at school before rocking up to play their characters – and play their own instruments – in the evening. It’s phenomenal.Amelie plays Summer, who always wants to please her teachers and others around her. At first, Dewey finds her quite irritating and a know-it-all but by the end he really warms to her.I taught Amelie in primary school where she was a member of the choir for five years. When I first heard her sing, in year 2, I was blown away by this little person with such a powerful, beautiful voice.We use a lot of music at school – if i’m asking the children to write a story then the right music can set the right tone. Music is also good for calming the children down and getting them in a positive mood for learning.School of Rock shows that being a teacher is not just about regimented education. It’s about the children’s emotional wellbeing and their happiness, too. I loved the film version and the West End show had all the same energy. I loved the new songs. Jake Sharp, who played Dewey at the performance we saw, really steps up to the mark and is a fantastic equal to Jack Black.When Charis sings Amazing Grace in the show it sent a shiver down my spine. The first time I heard her sing at primary school it was that song. We’re a church school, so hymns are a very important part of what we do. She was a quiet girl who got on with her work and was very caring to her younger brother. She always came alive when we had school performances. None of us were surprised, but we were very proud, when she was cast as Tomika.I always used to love hearing her sing in the nativities. She was such a natural on the stage. She’d take over and start directing people! In our school we have lots of teachers who are competitive and will encourage the children to participate. Charis performed at a local poetry competition at a young age. Sometimes schools lose that healthy competitiveness but I think it’s important.Right at the end of the show Charis saw me in the audience and gave me a cheeky wave. Afterwards I got to meet her and her mum and dad. I was Skyping her aunt with them. I was so proud. She’s a normal wee girl, she’s not had any specialist training or gone to acting or singing school. And there she was on the West End stage.I was buzzing afterwards. Stick it to the Man was stuck in my head all week. Jamal plays Freddy, who is always drumming away on something, and that’s Jamal in a nutshell. He wants to get involved in everything. Jamal plays hockey for the school as well. He never uses the show as an excuse to get out of anything – he finds the time to do it all and is loving the experience.Dewey finds the balance between getting to know the kids and getting the best out of them. I teach geography and I’m not musical at all but I do love my rock. If the students have a task to do, instead of just working in silence I’ll have some music on – Foo Fighters or Red Hot Chilli Peppers, something they wouldn’t necessarily have heard of.When Jamal entered the stage I was welling up. I felt quite emotional and very proud. At the end, the whole school are at the battle of the bands and Dewey announces them one by one and they do a solo. When Dewey says: “And on the drums … Jamal Ahmed as Freddy”, it was awesome. We all waited at the backstage door after, but I had to join the queue while they signed autographs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb68ddaa34dbafc4553137aec1204d3e815bb5b7/0_0_4261_2904/master/4261.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9967e8745db34e027868b6e47e450c0 700w","title":"apple iphone xs review battery life camera design performance","story":"The iPhone XS hasn’t broken mould like the iPhone X, and it has weaker battery life, but its camera, design and performance are class-leadingThe iPhone XS isn’t the only all-screen iPhone on the block this year, but with its balance of large screen and small body, is it still the iPhone to buy?To say that the iPhone XS looks exactly the same as the iPhone X is somewhat of an understatement. Apart from a pair of new antenna lines and asymmetric holes in the bottom, the phone is an identical metal and glass sandwich. Unless you buy the new gold colour.Fortunately that’s not a bad thing this generation, as it maintains everything that made last year’s iPhone X so good. That includes the large screen squeezed into a small body, the luxurious feel and top-notch new design that ditched the home button.The 5.8in OLED screen is one of the best ever fitted to a smartphone and makes watching movies and TV shows on the commute a joy. The speakers are now louder, but there’s still no headphone jack nor a lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box this time round.Weighing 177g, the iPhone XS is 3g heavier than the phone it replaces, 3g lighter than the Huawei P20 Pro but 14g heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also thinner than most at 7.7mm thick. All of which is to say it’s easy to pocket and handle, with either one or two hands.The iPhone XS has the same internals as its bigger sibling, the XS Max, and unsurprisingly performs exactly the same. With the six-core A12 Bionic the phone is responsive, smooth and likely has more raw power than most will need, until some magical new app comes along to take advantage of it.Game performance is also excellent, while the improved AI processor speeds up AR experiences and other machine-learning systems.Unfortunately, like the iPhone XS Max, the iPhone XS marks a step backwards in terms of battery life for Apple. Where the iPhone X lasted 30 hours between charges, the iPhone XS only just scrapes 24 hours.That means if I take it off the charger at 7am on day one, it’ll only just make it to my alarm at 7am the next day without being plugged in, meaning you will definitely need to fully charge it at least once a day. On heavy days it would be on its knees as I made it to bed.That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.A full-day’s battery is the bare minimum that’s acceptable in 2018, and competitors can last closer to double that.While there are many factors that affect battery life, it’s worth noting that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max were affected to a greater extent by cellular network congestion, such as that experienced on commuter trains and in packed stations, than competitors.Both phones bounced around between Edge, 3G and 4G more often than the iPhone X, Google’s Pixel 2 XL and a OnePlus 6, and even with full 4G signal the iPhones struggled to pull down data and got hotter where the competitors still managed to load sites and emails, albeit slowly.The iPhone XS runs iOS 12 out of the box, which is a refinement of last year’s iOS 11 rather than a massive shakeup. It still has the same problems of status icons being lost because of the notch in the screen, but it has made big improvements with grouped notification handling and now has integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.Apple has also added a prominent banner on the lock screen when you have Do Not Disturb active, which makes it much harder to forget to deactivate it when you wake up.Face ID returns as Apple’s only biometric option on the iPhone XS. It works just as well as it did last year, identifying me without fault, unveiling my notifications and unlocking the phone.It can have problems with certain sunglasses, and it would also be nice to have the option of using my fingerprint to unlock or pay for things.The iPhone XS has the same camera system as fitted to the XS Max – two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one with a wide-angle lens and the other a 2x telephoto lens.New for this year is better detail capture, particularly when images are viewed at full resolution, and better low light performance. But it is Apple’s improved “Smart HDR” function that is most noticeable, making images with extremes of contrast such as those shot into the sun much more usable.The portrait mode has also been improved, now with the ability to adjust the level of background blur after capture, which is fun.The selfie camera is good, but not quite the best on the market for preserving skin detail. Some have complained that it smooths skin and makes them look orange, but that’s not something I could see in photos.The iPhone XS comes in your choice of black, silver or gold, costing £999 for 64GB of storage, £1,149 for 256GB or £1,349 for 512GB.The 6.1in iPhone XR will be released in October costing £749 for £64GB of storage.The iPhone X set a new bar for what an iPhone could be. It was a massive step forward for Apple and put it ahead of many competitors in smartphone design and function.The iPhone XS maintains the forward-looking design and function, feeling wonderful in the hand, has a noticeably better camera and is still arguably the best phone on the market right now at balancing screen size with usability.But it’s certainly not perfect, with weaker battery life than last year and a still eye-watering price. With the cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR around the corner, it might be worth waiting to see what it’s like before shelling out £999, but the iPhone XS is still great.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, very expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The report claims Amazon became aware of the attack during movesby its subsidiary Amazon Web Services (AWS) to purchase streaming video compression firm Elemental Technologies in 2015. Apple had reportedly bought around 7,000 Super Micro servers when its security teams discovered the chips.The report cited 17 unnamed intelligence and company sources as saying that Chinese spies had placed computer chips inside equipment used by around 30 companies, as well as multiple US government agencies, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks.Amazon, Apple and Super Micro have all denied Bloomberg’s report. Amazon said: “It’s untrue that AWSknew about a supply chain compromise, an issue with malicious chips, or hardware modifications when acquiring Elemental.”AWS said: “As we shared with Bloomberg BusinessWeek multiple times over the last couple months, at no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in SuperMicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems.‎”Apple said: “On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, ‘hardware manipulations’ or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.”“We remain unaware of any such investigation,” said Super Micro.Super Micro Computer engineers its equipment in San Jose, but, like the majority of electronics firms, it outsources manufacturing, including to contractors in China.The Chinese government has also denied the report. A spokesperson said: “China is a resolute defender of cybersecurity.

In contrast to all this wild movement and scattering through which we’ve been driving, our destination, Llwyn Celyn (meaning holly bush) at the mouth of the Llanthony Valley near Abergavenny, appears as a mass of stillness and solidity, looming dark above us. With no exterior lights and the rain dashing the windscreen, it’s hard to make out much more so, with two sleeping children in the car, I head into the house to find their bedrooms.As I move through the house turning on lights, the centuries seem to unfold with each illuminated room. Finely carved, pointed ogee arches, heavy flagstone floors, a table etched with ancient initials, decorated and elegantly arching roof timbers, a cavernous bread oven.In the dining room, a 600-year-old bench is fixed along the far wall. This is, I later learn, where the master of the house once sat at the “high” end of the hall looking through an open fire and a wooden screen towards the “low” end of the buttery and pantry, now a boot room and a study. In a cobbled yard between the kitchen and the cider house (converted into a bedroom and bathroom) I find a huge stone trough receiving a steady flow of the hill’s runoff, its curves, worn over the centuries, making it appear more grown into being than placed.It’s only with the morning sunlight that the exterior of Llwyn Celyn reveals itself in full, its renovated roof tiled in stone from the nearby Olchon valley and its new coat of white limewash bright against a wide view of fields and hedges on the surrounding low ridges.The main building, which has been dated through oxygen isotope research by Swansea University to 1420-21, has the classic floor plan of a vernacular medieval hall house of this area. Attached to it, and making the house an even rarer survivor of the 15th century, is a two-storey solar wing, which housed the lord and lady’s private sleeping chambers. Beyond these living quarters a spread of outbuildings speak not only of the once-high status of this house but also of the self-sufficiency born of this close-knit valley landscape of upland grazing and rich alluvial fields – threshing barn, stables, pigsty, beast house, cidery and kiln house for malt and corn.Llwyn Celyn was built just five years after Owain Glyndŵr’s rebellion against the English crown (1400-1415), a time when many similar hall houses in Wales were destroyed. Who it was built for isn’t known but given that the land belonged to nearby Llanthony Priory (whose cellar bar is nowadays the perfect end point for walks in the area) it’s possible the first owner of the house was the prior himself.A succession of farming families inhabited the house after that and in around 1690 one of them, the Watkins family, undertook major improvements, most noticeably inserting a ceiling into the open space of the hall to create a large upper chamber reached by a wooden staircase alongside the substantial chimney stack.It is to this 17th-century arrangement that the Landmark Trust has, over two years and at a cost of £4.2m, “gently returned” Llwyn Celyn, discovering bread ovens, fireplaces, windows, doorways and even a pair of shoes (to ward off witchcraft) behind layers of 19th- and 20th-century plasterboard. The restoration walks a fine line between authenticity and modern comforts (most rooms have underfloor heating, the bathrooms rose head showers and in the living room a wood-burning stove, not an open fire, now throws its flame-light over the rafters) but it is also, as one carpenter who worked on the house put it, “honest”. New inserts and graftings of wood have been left a lighter shade than the original carpentry, so the building wears the patchwork of its recovery on its sleeve.Lying on a sofa in Llwyn Celyn looking over this play of light and dark in the structure above, it’s impossible not to feel, at a visceral level, the decay from which the house has been saved. It’s a sensation amplified for me by the fact that for many years when I was younger, I only ever knew Llwyn Celyn – as I walked, drove or rode past it – as a rough canvas of emergency scaffolding and sheeting. What exactly lay under those coverings I could only ever imagine, so to find myself now eating, sleeping and playing with my children within its walls is an experience both strange and comforting. Just as Llwyn Celyn remained unknown to me when I was younger, so did its immediate surroundings. The Llanthony Valley, a few miles up the road, is a walkers’ and runners’ playground, with numerous paths and trails between the Hatteral Ridge and Offa’s Dyke to the east, and the ridge of Grwyne Fawr to the west. It’s also a place rich in history, from the intricate 15th-century rood screen in the church at Patrishow to the chapel and monastery at Capel-y-Ffin, once the home of sculptor and typographer Eric Gill and, briefly, the artist and writer David Jones. The ridges of the upper valley, therefore, were always my destination rather than the gentler undulations at its mouth. With this in mind we choose to walk from Llwyn Celyn itself, taking a circular route through the mature beech, oak and sycamore woodland of Coed y Cerrig then rising up around Twyn y Gaer, an iron-age hill fort, before dropping back down to the Queen’s Head near Cwmyoy for lunch.The woods feel remarkably in tune with the atmosphere and age of the house from which we began our walk, and as we climb the slope under their moss-covered branches, lines of a medieval poem by Llwelyn ap y Moel, To the Greenock Woods, come to mind:Faultless nurture, it’s been goodTo have you as my safeguard,Sweet close and veil for refuge,Strong and swiftly sheltering hedge,beneath me level greensward,Green, kind earth, gem of a lord,Trusses of sweet leaves crowdedLike a dark tent overheadDuring our stay at Llwyn Celyn, I was struck by how all of us, parents and children alike, kept touching the house as we moved through it – window sills, beams, doors – as if to attempt to read them and their centuries of witness. I don’t know how successfully we did it, but certainly on leaving my wife and I felt an odd sense of ownership, of a quality we’ve never known with other holiday rentals. Llwyn Celyn had, undoubtedly, over our brief time there, contributed to our lives.• Accommodation was provided by the Landmark Trust.

Here are some of your storiesWatching Dr Christine Blasey Ford share her traumatic experiences of sexual assault had a profound impact on women and men across the US and the world.Hundreds of women and some men got in touch with the  to share their responses to the hearing last week. For many, Ford’s testimony dredged up painful memories of their own experiences of sexual violence, that had often been privately endured for years. However, Ford’s bravery in the face of those who were at times both hostile and disbelieving also empowered survivors they felt that they were no longer alone and that they too had a voice.Many felt the urge to take action, both in support of those who had been affected but also to change societal attitudes to sexual harassment. Here are some of their stories.I am one who has been dealing consciously and therapeutically with these issues and their effects for decades. The work is ongoing. The effects linger. The triggers are there.I believe after watching the hearing I may become more outspoken and feel a bit more free to discuss openly the pervading issues of abuse, misuse and violence against girls and women that is pandemic in our cultures and societies. We need to let each other know that we are not alone, that it is possible to heal, and that life is worth living.If you are being surprised, triggered or bushwacked by what’s appearing in the Ford news coverage, please take care of yourself. Call a confidant. Call a crisis line. Call or find a therapist. Start or continue to do the work – the work that is so essential to your own well-being and those you love. Be brave. Be wise. Be fearless. And know that you are not alone.”Susan Powers Bourne, poet and artist, Chester, VermontI went to protest the hearing with my friend Sarah. We have been engaged in a lot of activism since Trump became president. We march, we sign petitions, we send money, we write letters and we knock on doors. When it was clear there would be a hearing we immediately planned to go to DC for it.Immediately when we got to the supreme court it felt different to other marches we had been on. There was an element of trauma that hovered overhead and enveloped the protesters. Standing next to someone with your fist held high you found yourself suddenly listening to a three- or four-line confession in a hurried low tone, about a rape, a beating, a drunken nightmare ordeal. All ages, all races were here and were doing this. Women in wheelchairs and women with strollers.We grouped together in our black clothes and mourned the people we might have been if we hadn’t been carrying around so much trauma. Ford’s testimony elevated that level of trauma and made it unbearable. We had all been there. We felt her fear and we felt our own. We remembered other heavy bodies, other locked doors, other laughs. When she had finished it was as though we had been through one long massive therapy session. Things were definitely different, but not necessarily better.“Watching the hearings gave me a sense of catharsis that has been empowering. I’m a survivor of sexual assault who experienced rape in high school. Right after my 18th birthday I was raped by two college-age men. This was my first sexual experience and it has given me lasting pain and trauma that has manifested in addictions and relationship problems. I hid the rape for 10 years from everyone but my closest confidants, but watching Ford reminded me that I’m not alone.Hearing her give her testimony brought back a flood of pain and emotions that I couldn’t hold back. I sobbed and shook while watching her but I felt heard for the first time. The shame and guilt lessened- a sense of solidarity arose. Despite what happens, she is a hero for speaking out. The catharsis of hearing her story and knowing I’m not alone changed my life. I actually researched my options for reporting the rape after hearing her story and learned that the statute of limitations is still open. The pain is still there, but knowing there’s a body of women and allies who support survivors makes all the difference.For all the survivors of sexual assault: I see you, I hear you. As a country, this is a moment to confront a dark shadow and turn a page to a world where women are believed, survivors have a community and government who supports them, and powerful men cannot discredit women just because it’s inconvenient.While reading much of the reporting I couldn’t watch more than a few minutes of her testimony. It just hurt too much. After the treatment of Anita Hill and now the partisan bickering on a subject that affects so many of us, it is small wonder the two major parties are bleeding members.I was a victim of a sexual predator in the family. I kept silent for over 40 years. It adversely affected my entire life. My family still doesn’t know. Only my two closest friends and the psychiatrist that helped me dig the memories out of a very dark place know. Until now. I have more hope that this problem will continue to be discussed and women will be less likely to have to suffer in silence for the actions of the men who prey upon them. If you have been taken advantage of sexually, speak out, whether you’re a man or a woman. Rally around those who have done so.It is a deeply upsetting time to be a woman in America.I have this message for all of the good men in this country, the men who watched and were appalled and know in their hearts and minds that the men with power are ruining our country and hurting its people: It isn’t enough to be good and kind and loving and woke.Leave your house, take action, write, fundraise, help, canvass, do more than coach your kids’ soccer teams, expecting accolades. Move out of your comfort zones and get involved. Be willing to be uncomfortable and listen and learn from women. We aren’t going to calm down. We are worn out, scared and need ACTIVE allies. This is too much for us. We need you, but more than just your inner goodness. Take action.Claire (not her real name), Oregon I was driving with my husband and we had the hearing on the radio. I already knew it would be hard to listen to, but thought I’d try it, to show support. I ended up crying and shaking. I am a volunteer with Rainn and work on their online chat. I listen to stories like this all the time and I’ve never had that kind of reaction. But her talk of how she’s been treated since she spoke up was unbearable. Her story was my story.I went on the hotline that night as I wanted to help those who had been triggered the way I had. The queues were higher than I’ve ever seen. I spoke with women who had been raped decades ago and had never told anyone. One woman was 83. It was a remarkable night, one I’ll never forget.This has shown me that we will never win if we stay quiet. We have to create safe spaces for women to come forward and share their experiences. There is a desperate lack of resources available to support survivors, successful prosecution rates are incredibly low, and rape kits sit untested for years. We need a study of lost hours to show the full cost – emotional, mental and economic. To all the women out there: I believe you. I’m here to listen to you.I feel sickened by what has been revealed about the character, objectives, and Machiavellian behavior of the Republican party in the House and Senate in the last two years.I have become a political activist for the first time in nearly 40 years of being an eligible voter. I feel this country is teetering on the precipice of disaster. As an attorney, I still had lingering faith in the supreme court and the process by which justices were appointed. No more. So I want to work to ensure that, in the future, the constitution is made stronger so that it works the way it was intended to even if our public servants no longer have the good of the country and upstanding morals assumed by its framers.Republicans: can you even distinguish right from wrong, good from evil any more? Oh wait, abortion is evil, therefore all manner of evil and deception is justified in the name of preventing it. And killing people once born through unfettered access to military-grade weapons is entirely different. I used to acknowledge our differences but respect you. After the last two years, Republicans have lost my respect forever.Debbie Harris, mid-50s, attorney in a major US cityThe testimony of Ford was impressive. I am a man who experienced violence and sexual predation as a child and teenager. I recognized in Ford’s account my own lifelong fight with memories, sometimes flashbacks, and frequent nightmares. I recognized in her testimony the always present fear of power, especially of assertive, domineering men in professional and social contexts.Like Ford, the sad experiences of my youth apparently did not break me: I am a successful scientist with a coveted tenure and a very well-paid position, I am a father of three, I have a wonderful wife and many friends. Maybe the sad experiences of my youth helped me to free myself from a social milieu lacking education and caught in poverty. Now I am over 60, there is hardly a week when I do not wake up at night in tears, tired of my lifelong fighting for a normal life – whatever it might be.We have to acknowledge what has been kept secret too long, help people to speak out, oppose domineering attitudes, and speak out ourselves as Ford so courageously did. To all victims of violence: you are not alone. Speak out and you’ll get the help you need and deserve.Jack (not his real name), EuropeI thought I was OK. I stayed away for the most part but then, piece by piece, I found myself completely immersed in it. I happened to hear Kavanaugh’s response first, in the car. When I got home, I knew I had to sit and watch Ford speak. So I did. And that’s when the anger hit, and it hasn’t relented.All the women I have spoken to, and everything I have read by women – we all see ourselves in her.What’s worse to me is that after hearing her testimony, I can’t imagine flat out not believing her. What I think is far more likely is that the majority of the senate committee believe her – they just don’t care. I felt this way after Trump’s election, and I feel that way now. Irrelevant, a piece of shrapnel, collateral damage that can be swept away for the benefit of upwardly mobile, powerful men.Just as mothers of girls have to tell them how to protect themselves in an attack, I will teach my boys that if they ever see a man do anything that makes a vulnerable person feel uncomfortable, that they are complicit in that act if they stay silent. To speak up loudly, to be the kind of men that are true allies. Men that will never ever walk away from something they saw at a party. Men that will put their own bodies and careers at risk because women have done it for long enough. Time’s up, dudebros of the world. We are coming for you, and we are angry, and we are done.I am a survivor. Hearing the Senate committee consider ignoring Ford’s experience grated on the wounds in my soul. I am nearly 20 years older than Ford and my own experience of sexual abuse has had more time to heal through the decades. I had feared that listening to her testimony would induce vivid flashbacks of my own abuse, but this did not happen. Perhaps, if one allows enough time and gets very good therapy and supportive friends and family, healing is possible, and I wish healing for all of us survivors.After worship on Sunday, as we went around the room to say our names, women started saying “… And I am a survivor” or “Me too, I survived”. More than half the women there spoke up later, I learned that other survivors had felt more comfortable not speaking their experience aloud that day. That experience – all of us, gathered together, speaking our truth and being supported by many of the men among us, was powerfully healing for me.I am thinking hard about the high school culture that was accepted in the 1960-80s. I am proud of my gentle and responsible sons, and hope that all boys will have parents, teachers and social networks that foster deep friendship without seeking male bonding through violence toward others.Some names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ca2353d4e73eadd2cf345d5e43aa1c436dc0b99/0_108_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b38784dbadf972ed4f2920669682812","title":"bungling agents leave putin exposed in the global spotlight","story":"Botched missions in Salisbury and The Hague may prompt Russian leader to reassess his targeting of the westSpies do not always want to advertise their victories, preferring John Le Carré’s advice “better to be silent, be blank”. But in the case of the battle between MI6 and the GRU, a decision has been made in Whitehall to highlight and isolate the Russian military intelligence arm, aiming to turn it from a source of Vladimir Putin’s power to an impediment.In part, the double exposure of the GRU – first wandering around Salisbury in search of the doorknob of Sergei Skripal’s home, and then caught in a carpark in the The Hague hacking into the chemical weapons watchdog – has simply been made possible by Russian incompetence.Both missions by the GRU, the most adventurous of the Russian intelligence agencies, were bungled. Its agents not only failed to assassinate Skripal with novichok, but they were also caught in April trying to discover how far OPCW scientists had progressed in detecting the nerve agent.UK officials could have let the second episode lie, privately content to know that Russia had been left to speculate to what degree the work of its agents was compromised.But part of the Dutch operation started to leak. Dutch and Swiss media reported in September that two Russians were arrested in April in The Hague after trying to hack into the OPCW headquarters. It was also reported that the two agents had been planning to travel on to the OPCW-registered laboratory in Spiez near Berne. Further details emerged, but the extent to which the Russians had been caught red-handed was not disclosed.But once the damning photographic evidence of the GRU agents in Salisbury had been revealed, reducing Moscow to largely incredible explanations, Whitehall took the decision to go on the offensive, and broaden the case against the GRU by revealing the extent to which Russia has been seeking to disrupt western institutions.A British government official explained: “Shock went around the world after the novichok incident in Salisbury. We said we would call them out both to deter and to defend. We are not seeking to escalate, but we will defend ourselves, partly by shining a light and partly by sharing the information we have in a new way.”It was felt that the public in the west had no inkling of the scale of the Russian hacking operation.The Netherlands defence intelligence and security service needed to complete their investigation, and the UK needed the party conference season to conclude.Once these two landmarks were passed, the UK intelligence machine was ready to reveal unprecedented evidence on The Hague arrests. The revelations were made in the context of “a constant and pervasive effort” by Russian front organisations to launch hacking operations against western governments and international institutions.The aim, the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said, was to illustrate to Putin that the price for this activity is too high. In particular, Hunt believes that if Putin wants to have a role on the international stage, he will have to end Russia’s ongoing defence of the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.The OPCW was not only targeted by Russia due to its testing of novichok samples. The chemical weapons watchdog has become the centre of a diplomatic battle, as Russia resists British-led efforts to extend the OPCW’s mandate from merely certifying whether chemical weapons have been used to identifying the country or forces responsible for their use.The OPCW, in Russia’s view, has been shifted from a purely scientific body to a political actor capable of attributing responsibility for war crimes in Syria and elsewhere.Speculation in British government circles suggests the GRU is now internally vulnerable after these errors, and that Putin is not thrilled that the attack on Skripal backfired so badly. The absurd explanations advanced by Russian agents over their visit to Salisbury suggests that the Russian ministry of defence has been left to fend for itself. However, Putin’s dismissal of Skripal as a scumbag hardly suggests a man about to repent.It is a high-risk strategy that in the short term worsens Anglo-Russian relations. But it will also solidify the European and American alliance against Russia. And by strengthening the intelligence bond in the west, it could – possibly – give Putin cause to reflect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba66b90fa35828851defec5d5a10589c2e64a5e/7_8_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=898b8408f23cf9f0b5c32fec5b224ea6","title":"friday briefing the spies who muffed it","story":"How Russian cyber-attack on WMD watchdog was foiled … what is ‘Canada-plus-plus-plus’ … and Vitamin D supplements ‘not needed’Good morning. I’m Warren Murray presenting the news digest you should never leave home without.It must go down as one of the most embarrassing months ever for Russia’s military intelligence, Luke Harding writes today – the secretive GRU agency has been publicly, comprehensively and humiliatingly exposed by rival intelligence agencies and online sleuths. The group of men caught trying to hack the OPCW chemical weapons watchdog were outed by mundane details such as their taxi receipts – as well as the compromising of their cover by everything from online college histories and vehicle records to internet dating profiles, car pool records and football team rosters.Our visual guide explains the clumsy attempt to hack the OPCW headquarters in the Netherlands, which happened only weeks after the Salisbury novichok attack. The crack team, who arrived on diplomatic passports, were monitored all the way from the airport by Dutch counter-intelligence and eventually caught in a rented Citroen with a bootload of hacking gear, mobile phones, stolen WiFi passwords and money. British officials say the same GRU “close access” unit previously tried in Malaysia to hack the investigation into the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. They were also in Switzerland when the World Anti-Doping Agency was hacked. The GRU made other failed attempts to hack the UK Foreign Office and Porton Down chemical warfare facility. Patrick Wintour examines how the British government decided to go on the offensive and lead its western allies in laying bare the GRU’s brazen activities.Men’s jobs under Brexit threat – There is a warning that older men with job-specific skills but few qualifications, particularly in manufacturing, are the group most at risk from job losses caused by new trade barriers after Britain leaves the EU. “These are the sorts of workers who are most likely to find it hard to adapt and to find new roles that are equally well paid elsewhere,” said Agnes Norris Keiller, a co-author of the report for the IFS thinktank. Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has urged Theresa May to publish her revised Brexit border plan “as soon as possible” and not wait until a crunch summit that starts on 17 October. Brexiters including Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis have seized on remarks by EU chief Donald Tusk that Brussels remains ready to offer the UK a “Canada-plus-plus-plus deal”: a trade accord with agreements on security and foreign policy. But they glossed over that it would likely include keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and single market.Snake bite kills Briton – A British man working on a fishing trawler off Australia’s northern coast has died after being bitten by a sea snake that was pulled up in its nets. Paramedics were called to the trawler on Thursday but the 23-year-old was already dead. The boat later docked at Borroloola in the Northern Territory. Sea snakes are venomous but considered to be non-aggressive and rarely attack unless provoked. The British embassy was notified, said Northern Territory police.Elongated scandal – If investors want Tesla to put the fraud furore behind it, their cause has not been helped by founder Elon Musk mocking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “The Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,” he tweeted, after having agreed to pay a $20m fine and step aside as Tesla’s chairman for three years. Musk’s seemingly spurious statements in August about taking Tesla private have also cost the company itself a $20m fine. His tweets appeared to be aimed at boosting Tesla’s share price to punish short-sellers. A US district judge has ordered the SEC and Musk to demonstrate their settlement of the fraud charges is fair, reasonable and does not hurt the public interest.Kavanaugh cleared, say Republicans – Two key Republican senators, Susan Collins, and Jeff Flake, have expressed satisfaction with the FBI report into sexual misconduct claims against Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee. The Democrats have criticised the investigation, implying that it was kept narrow in scope to protect Kavanaugh, while hundreds of women, including Amy Schumer, were arrested when thousands protested at the US Capitol in Washington.Republican leaders in the Senate are moving to guillotine the debate, which could lead to a vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination as early as Saturday.Paris punch sentence – A man who assaulted a woman outside a Paris cafe has been given six months in prison and ordered to pay a €2,000 fine. Video went viral of the attack on student Marie Laguerre, 22. The defendant, referred to as Firas M, was also given a six-month suspended jail term and ordered to have treatment for drug and alcohol problems. Noemie Saidi-Cottier, Laguerre’s lawyer, said: “My client wanted a punishment but she didn’t want his head to roll … If he never does that again, she feels she has won.” Within days of the attack, a new law imposed on-the-spot fines of up to €750 on cat-callers and aggressively lecherous people.Sunlight can’t be bottled – Vitamin D supplements do nothing for bone health and the government should stop telling people to take them in the darker months, according to the biggest ever review of research on the subject. Vitamin D is made in the body naturally from exposure to the sun. Researchers who trawled 81 separate studies found supplements helped only people at high risk of a few rare conditions. But Professor Martin Hewison from the University of Birmingham, who was not one of the authors, says too little research has been done on people with very low vitamin D levels to be certain of the findings.

The agency has always had a reputation for daring, bolstered by its affiliation with special forces commando units and agents who have seen live combat.But in dispatching agents to the Netherlands who could, just using Google, be easily exposed as graduates of an elite GRU academy, the agency appears reckless and absurdly sloppy.One of the suspected agents, tipped as a “human intelligence source” by Dutch investigators, had registered five vehicles at a north-western Moscow address better known as the Aquarium, the GRU finishing school for military attaches and elite spies. According to online listings, which are not official but are publicly available to anyone on Google, he drove a Honda Civic, then moved on to an Alfa Romeo. In case the address did not tip investigators off, he also listed the base number of the Military-Diplomatic Academy.That was the same school where Anatoliy Chepiga, the alleged true identity of the Russian suspect in the Salisbury poisoning, finished his education. Viktor Suvorov, a GRU agent who later defected to the west, described the academy as so secret that Soviet citizens could be jailed just for revealing its existence.The internet has now made it far harder to hide that evidence. But the GRU apparently thought that would not matter.Meanwhile, most of the alleged agents could be found online.One of the men, Aleksei Morenets, an alleged hacker, appeared to have set up a dating profile.Another played for an amateur Moscow football team “known as the security services team” a current player told the Moscow Times. “Almost everyone works for an intelligence agency.” The team rosters are publicly available.Russia has claimed that the investigations are fake and that researchers are in league with western intelligence. But most of the evidence to uncover the spies was already out there, and conveniently timestamped on social media.The saga began after May’s announcement last month, when Vladimir Putin ordered the two Salisbury suspects to appear on television. There, the two men fumbled through an awkward story about visiting Salisbury twice to see the cathedral, while an editor for state television cast aspersions that they were gay.It didn’t help. One of the two men was outed as a likely GRU colonel anyway, after online investigators dug up photographs from his military service and leaked passport records.Along the way, the researchers from Bellingcat and the Insider also recognised that the men were issued sequentially numbered passports by a special ision, making it easier for anyone with access to a leaked database to identify them.And then came Thursday’s bombshell: four men outed by Dutch investigators for attempting to hack into the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (as well as Malaysia’s investigation into a downed jetliner).The alleged spies were caught carrying enough telephones to fill an electronics store. Moreover, like all meticulous Russians on a business trip, they held on to their taxi receipts from GRU headquarters.Russia will publicly deny the latest reports and revelations about the alleged GRU agents. It has no other alternative. But the exposure of several consecutive European operations should raise questions about whether Russian military intelligence is being intentionally provocative or has simply gone off the rails."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f1abb61b6514eca785ce23dc0cab17cb83c441d/50_196_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0deb9bdc7d5558a2ff59a7738400b13f","title":"nobel peace prize 2018 live updates","story":"Mukwege and Murad recognised for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon in warLong read: The village where dozens of young girls have been raped is still waiting for justice Murad who was abducted with other Yazidi women in August 2014 when their home village of Kocho in Sinjar, northern Iraq, was attacked by Isis jihadis. was joint winner of the won the EU’s prestigious Sakharov human rights prize in 2016.The same year, she won the won the Council of Europe’s Václav Havel human rights prize.She was captured alongside her sisters, and lost six brothers and her mother as Isis jihadis killed the village’s men and any women considered too old to be sexually exploited.Murad, 25, is the second youngest Nobel peace prize laureate after Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she won in 2014.They have both put their own personal security at risk by courageously combatting war crimes and securing justice for victims. Apparently the committee have been unable to contact either Mukwege or Murad on the telephone to inform them that they have won. If they are watching this, my heartfelt congratulations.The committee says the Congolese doctor, Denis Mukwege has been “the foremost, most unifying symbol both nationally and internationally of the struggle to end sexual violence in war and armed conflict”. Nadia Murad, a member of the Yazidi minority in Iraq, was captured by Isis and repeatedly raped and subjected to other abuses. The committee says she showed “uncommon courage in recounted her own suffering”.They are recognised for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon in war.You can watch the announcement, which follows imminently, live here:The former Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has expressed what is no doubt on many people’s minds when it comes to Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un being among the bookmakers’ favourites for the prize. She told Australian Associated Press:That is an extraordinary proposition in anyone’s language.But she had some praise for the US president’s unconventional approach. President Trump adopted an unorthodox diplomatic stance ... he’s continued to promote the personal relationship between the two leaders as the basis for a negotiated peace.The credentials of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, have also been touted ahead of today’s announcement. She welcomed hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into the country in the face of vocal political backlash, which is ongoing. She has already been awarded the Saint Francis Lamp for Peace prize this year after she “distinguished herself in the work of reconciliation and the peaceful coexistence among peoples”AP reports that among the nominees are the Syrian civilian aid group, White Helmets, also tipped last year, Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Edward Snowden and the UN High Commissioner for Refugee., AP reports.The prize is worth The 2018 prize is worth 9 million Swedish kronor (£750.000). ast winners who came under criticism include former U.S. President Barack Obama, who won in 2009 after less than a year in office.Welcome to the ’s coverage of this year’s Nobel peace prize ceremony.Past winners have included luminaries such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Martin Luther King Jr, Mother Theresa and Nelson Mandela. More controversial recipients include Henry Kissinger, Barack Obama, in 2009, months after entering office and Aung San Suu Kyi, although in the latter case the controversy arose years after she received the award, when Myanmar was accused of genocide of the Rohingya.

While it might be considered more palatable to give it to the South’s representative alone, most observers believe it would be premature.Recent winners have tended to be less contentious than some of the past picks (last year’s was the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons). Among the less controversial names which could be in the frame are a UN agency such as the World Food programme or the UN refugee agency. Denis Mukwege, a Congolese gynaecologist who treated thousands of rape victims during the war, has been touted as a deserving recipient for a number of years. For the Ethiopian prime minister, Dr Abiy Ahmed, who has restored ties with Eritrea after 20 years of enmity, and freed thousands of political prisoners, his achievements have probably come too late for him to be recognised this year.We will find out the winner at 10am BST."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3652002.1538676641!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit taoiseach says any new trade arrangement must have level playing field","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has met with EU Council president Donald Tusk in Brussels.

Photograph: EPA Taoiseach Leo Varadkar poured cold water on reports suggesting Ireland is enthusiastic about new Brexit backstop proposals expected from London in the next few days.Speaking to journalists in Brussels following meetings with European Council President Donald Tusk and the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Varadkar said he had yet to see any specific proposals but warned of “constraints” on the ideas being touted in draft British “hybrid Chequers” plans to resolve the backstop impasse in talks. These are based on accepting an all-UK customs union with the EU to obviate the need for a border between the UK and Northern Ireland.The Taoiseach also made clear that the Government does not see the need for a consent clause in the EU Withdrawal Agreement which would require approval from the Northern Ireland Assembly for regulatory controls between the two islands. Not only was the Assembly not functioning now – “that is the realpolitik” , he said, but “those who are now putting a huge emphasis on the need for cross-community consent need to bear in mind that cross-community consent was not sought for Brexit, and indeed the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted against it.”Mr Varadkar also strongly backed a rebuke by Mr Tusk to British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt over his comparison of the EU to the Soviet Union. “Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting,” Mr Tusk said at their joint press conference. “The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours. “The EU is about freedom and human rights, prosperity and peace, life without fear, it is about democracy and pluralism a continent without internal borders or walls. As the President of the European Council and someone who spent half of my life in the Soviet Bloc, I know what I’m talking about.”“ The British Government has asked for respect from the EU,” Mr Varadkar said, ”and the British Government deserves respect from the EU. But respect has to go both ways.”Urging caution on the UK’s custom union idea he said that “there would be constraints, a lot of countries would take the view that a UK-wide arrangement is really a matter for the future relationship which is about Ireland and Northern Ireland”. “I would feel strongly about this too that any kind of trade arrangement must have a level playing field.”“We couldn’t have a situation whereby UK businesses still had access to European markets but at the same time were able to lower wages, to lower labour standards, lower environmental standards, lower health and safety standards, lower product safety standards . . . In order to have free trade you must have fair trade as well and a level playing field .”Mr Tusk said that the EU “wants a relationship with the UK that is as close and special as possible”. “From the very beginning, the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada+++ deal – much further-reaching on trade, on internal security, and on foreign policy cooperation.”The Canadian agreement with the EU is a straightforward free trade deal which the EU has suggested for months could be tailored to UK needs if it insists on retaining its red lines on membership of the customs union and single market. Such a deal, however, would not remove the need for border controls and so would have to complement a Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Varadkar, whose meetings were part of preparations for the EU summit in a fortnight, said the EU and UK were entering “a critical and decisive stage in these negotiations” and expressed confidence that “there is a good opportunity to clinch a deal over the next couple of weeks”. A special summit would be convened in November but only if “decisive progress” was made in October, he said.Asked about DUP leader Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” comments, the Taoiseach said that “I’m absolutely conscious of our country’s difficult, unique history, the fact that over 3,000 people lost their lives . . .”.“I’m doing my best as Taoiseach to make sure that we never return to any bloodshed on the island and that means standing by and defending the Good Friday Agreement which brought peace to Britain and Ireland.”Earlier, Mr Varadkar and Mr Tusk called for an acceleration of the Brexit talks as the key summit looms in less than a fortnight. Mr Varadkar said they were entering what will be a critical phase of the negotiations and called on the parties to “get down to business” if they were to get an agreement “by November if at all possible”. His reference to November suggests that the Taoiseach may believe there are opportunities to bridge the gap between the EU and the UK in the next couple of weeks ahead of the October summit – November’s meeting will only be called if there is substantial progress. The Taoiseach again emphasised Ireland’s four key objectives in the talks: the survival of the Common Travel Area with the UK, the retention of a frictionless border on the island, the protection of citizens’ rights in Northern Ireland – he emphasised that Northern Ireland citizens will retain their right to be EU citizens – and ensuring as close a trading relationship with the UK as possible in the long term.With the British prime minister Theresa May having successfully come through her party conference yesterday, officials and politicians believe that long-awaited British proposals on the border backstop – which guarantees an open border in Ireland – will be made in the coming days.There is a growing sense that the gap between the British and Irish governments over the border could be closing, with Mrs May prepared to accept some checks on goods travelling between Britain and Ireland, but away from the border.While the EU will await the detail of the British proposals before evaluating whether they match expectations, there is a belief Ms May is preparing to make concessions which will arouse opposition among Brexiteers and in the DUP, according to four senior sources with involvement in the process in Dublin.The DUP has threatened to pull the plug on Mrs May and vote against any deal that would place a border in the Irish Sea, but sources say all efforts are being concentrated on persuading opponents that these checks would not be in the “Irish Sea”.“A lot of this is about language: if the checks are not being done, for example, in transit, on vessels, this is not the border,” said a Dublin source.The taoiseach can expect a show of support from EU politicians, who have long insisted there will be no Brexit orce deal without agreement on the Irish border.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe Government is set to cede power to local authorities by allowing them to build more council houses without having to go through lengthy approval processes.It effectively means local authorities will be given greater freedom to build more council houses without going through a process which can take more than 18 months.At present, councils must go through a four-stage approval process with the Department of Housing if they want to build developments over €2 million. Anything below that has to go through only one phase of approval.Informed sources said the latest move would push that threshold for one-stage approval towards €7 million. This is likely to benefit, in particular, urban local authorities attempting to build social housing in infill sites.The €2 million limit was seen as restricting the capacity of the Dublin local authorities to build social housing schemes. It is estimated that €20 million provides 50 social housing units, so a new level of €7 million would allow councils to fast-track developments of 15-20 units across the country.It follows Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy criticising local authorities for not doing enough to solve the housing and homelessness crisis.Fianna Fáil has described the €2 million threshold as “farcical” and has called for it to be changed. It made such a demand as part of the budget negotiations, along with other housing initiatives, such as an affordable housing scheme.Party leader Micheál Martin raised the €2 million threshold in the Dáil as recently as Wednesday, the same day as thousands protested outside Leinster House about the housing crisis.“The idea that a council that wants to build 10 houses at a cost of anything more than €2 million has to submit those plans to the department, go through a four-stage process and a 59-week timetable is ridiculous,” he said.Mr Murphy told the Dáil he had tried to cut down on procurement times, and said the “one-stage process local authorities can go through . . . is a much quicker process”.However, he maintains that about 200 projects that went through the longer process did not submit plans to the shorter system, even though they were eligible.Meanwhile, the Independent Alliance met Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe last night and is understood to have secured the full restoration of the social welfare Christmas bonus.Sources also said the Alliance was now likely to accept significant changes to the special hospitality VAT rate which is expected to rise from 9 per cent to 13.5 per cent for at least some sectors.The Alliance was told it faced a choice of VAT rises or increases in excise duty on diesel to fund other tax cuts and spending increases. There have been tensions between the Alliance and Fine Gael this week.Government sources have expressed exasperation that the Independent Alliance continually raises issues of concern to the elderly.Proposals to help older people who want to convert family homes into sub-units they could then let out are also still under consideration.Deputy Sean Canney, who left the Alliance but still supports the Government, has also been holding meetings with Mr Donohoe."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3652017.1538677760!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey america is the key to ireland s success","story":"Peter Casey has certainly added colour to the presidential campaign. The Derry-born businessman has given what might have been a pallid election an injection of Trumpean confrontation. He has been more upfront with his criticisms of, and less deferential, to the incumbent Michael D Higgins. Of the six, he is the outlier, with an unusual approach, with unusual ideas, and with unusual observations.Casey is a tall and imposing man with spiked grey hair but with the softest imaginable speaking voice, and a Derry accent that has remained undiluted despite decades living abroad.We meet in the Clayton Hotel on the eve of the launch of his election. The delivery might be soft but no other candidate can pump up the volume quite like he can when it comes to rhetoric, or be so candid and mischievous (including his contention, which he subsequently withdrew, that the Áras intruder last month might have been a “stunt”).Or, for that matter, produce yet another surprising dimension to his character – he is the author of a soon-to-be-published book about the enormously powerful Tata family dynasty in India.The other candidates have tended to genuflect to the incumbent but Casey dispenses with the niceties. Asked if he has a realistic prospect, he says anything can happen in politics before launching a critique.“Michael D has made some significant mis-steps which surprised me for a seasoned politician. When de Valera went for his last term he could have used self nomination but he did not. He went and got his 20 Oireachtas votes. Michael D could have done that but did not . . .Casey is also unhappy with what he saw as delaying tactics by the President who delayed announcing he would stand for re-election until the very end. “Then the summer vacation came in and councillors were away. We had the ridiculous situation where 10 or 11 councils were meeting on the same day. You could not get around them.“He did it deliberately so that it would be very difficult for anyone to be on the ballot.”He says that he first expressed his ambition to be president as far back as 1981, when he emigrated to Australia. But first he made his fortune. He started off doing sales for Rank Xerox and was clearly good at it. He then set up his own companies and made a lot of money. Then he lost it all. Then he made a lot of money again. Then he lost it all.The first time he got scorched it was with the property market in Australia. There was a bubble which burst. “I made long-term strategic bets that turned out to be strategically disastrous.That was a return to zero.”The second time was when he became involved in a tubular lighting product that made a lot of money but required huge investment a subsequent patent dispute ended up disastrously for him.“I was sitting in Atlanta with a minus €50,000 on my credit cards, I had maxed out the American Express,” he says.He went back to first principles and set up his company, Claddagh. Through his contacts he got a small contract with SAP, the German business software company, and grew his company into a substantial undertaking bringing him back into the millionaire category, or “the helicopter candidate” as one of his presidential rivals has described him.“As a company or inidual I have zero debt, probably because of my previous history. My books are squeaky clean and there is absolutely nothing to hide. I have instructed my accountants on both sides of the Atlantic to open up my books if others do it.”And so he had financial independence. His first foray was into the Seanad election two years ago. He said he must have driven 10,000 miles and met hundreds of councillors. It got him nowhere but he appreciates the kind of work councillors do. That partly explains, he says, why he will donate his salary to councils for charitable purposes and invite a different council to the Áras each month for information sharing.His dominant theme is about Irish Americans. “America is the key to Ireland’s success and 28 per cent of our exports go there. We have 40 million people. They are our greatest but under-utilised asset.”As president he said he would tap into that asset in a way that has not been done before, and bring the kind of coherence of purpose that has been achieved by the Jewish community.He has some other controversial views: he believes Ireland should have a closer alignment with Nato and reconsider the long-standing policy of neutrality, for instance. On the TV show Dragon’s Den he has an unfiltered view, believing it is fun and that most who come before the “dragons” no longer need an investment and are more motivated by publicity. His best-known investment from the programme was in the Starcamp kids’ camps which are now run in centres throughout the State.The TV series gave him some recognition but he’s not a household name. He accepts that, saying it is obviously a problem and the presidential campaign is “bizarrely short”.He then discloses the reasons he was delayed in starting his campaign. He got an E.coli infection earlier this summer that developed into a more serious condition and left him in an intensive care unit in Atlanta for eight days. He lost well over 6kg in weight.“I got out of hospital on a Thursday, flew back to Ireland on a Tuesday and launched on Thursday.”Nowadays he ides his time 70:30 between Donegal and Atlanta. He had a 1,115sq m home over there but has sold it and now rents a smaller property. All of his four children are at university stage, or are working.He says his strongest suits are business and the North.“I think I know more about it than anybody else including Michael D. He can out-recite me in poetry but when it comes to understanding macro economics and political economics, I’m way ahead of the rest of the team.”Casey was involved in the peace process after the Good Friday Agreement and has some very interesting views on how Brexit will play out in the North, including the possibility of an independent Ulster.“In the meantime Theresa May will be voted out of office and they are hoping for another referendum to stay in. That’s probably the more likely scenario.“The only challenge is that you might have Scotland wanting an independent Scotland.”But that might cause civil war?“A hard border could start a war. If you put a border in you have to put in the mechanism to enforce it, if you start putting in cameras and electronic surveillance.”Would that mean the North would be an autonomous region or full independent?“Independent Northern Ireland would be manna from heaven for Britain if they could get away with it,” he said, adding that the Unionists would only accept it as a last resort.”Is is fanciful? Is a Peter Casey presidency fanciful?

Video: EU Council\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach  Leo Varadkar and  EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels,  October 4th. Photograph: ReutersYves HermanDonald Tusk, Michel Barnier and Leo Varadkar presented a united front in Brussels on Thursday, sounding frosty as they called for an acceleration of Brexit negotiations. After an initially warm response from Dublin to hints about Britain’s forthcoming proposal on the backstop, the Taoiseach struck a more sceptical tone in Brussels.The British proposal, which will be presented to the EU in the next week or so, accepts that Northern Ireland should remain in regulatory alignment with the EU for goods. It will include a modified version of the temporary customs arrangement it proposed for the whole of the UK last June.\u0026nbspThis envisaged that the\u0026nbspterritory of the UK would form part of the EU’s customs territory after the end of the post-Brexit transition in December 2020.“The temporary customs arrangement would eliminate tariffs, quotas, rules of origin and customs processes including declarations on all UK-EU trade. To operate effectively, the temporary customs arrangement would need to provide for the UK’s application of the EU customs legislation,” it said.Keeping the entire UK in the customs union would eliminate the need for customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, although the EU has concerns about how it would operate. But the British proposal on the regulation of goods moves London close to the EU’s “de-dramatised” backstop plan.Under Barnier’s latest proposal, which he outlined to EU leaders at Salzburg last month, the regulatory control of goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland would take the form of market surveillance rather than checks at ports or on vessels. This means that products are monitored in the market to ensure they are safe and manufactured in accordance with EU harmonisation requirements.British negotiators accept the need for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on agricultural products, which Barnier says would be conducted at ports and vessels as they are now. Currently, just 10 per cent of such products are checked and Britain wants the EU to drop its demand that 100 per cent should be checked after Brexit.The EU wants a permanent “all-weather” backstop to be included in the legally-binding text of the withdrawal agreement. But British negotiators want the withdrawal agreement to include only a temporary version of the backstop, which could be superseded by another version negotiated as part of the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.Britain also envisages a role for Stormont in authorising continued regulatory alignment with the EU, citing a paragraph in last December’s joint report approved by Britain and the EU.“The United Kingdom will ensure that no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, unless, consistent with the 1998 Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree that distinct arrangements are appropriate for Northern Ireland,” it says.EU and Irish negotiators interpret the paragraph as a unilateral British commitment and argue that it would give the DUP a veto through the use of a “petition of concern”. They also point out that the British government is negotiating the withdrawal agreement on behalf of the British state and that the Northern institutions have no standing to negotiate that binding agreement.The most difficult issues between London and Brussels are likely to focus on what elements of the backstop are included in the withdrawal agreement and what should be in the political declaration about the future relationship between Britain and the EU. British negotiators complain that the EU wants to put all the European demands into the legally binding withdrawal agreement and all the British ones into the more aspirational, political declaration.But the EU and Ireland will insist that for the backstop to have any force, its hardest elements must be locked down in the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspDuring the Conservative party conference in Birmingham this week, the DUP strutted around the convention centre warning that they would vote down any backstop deal that violated their demand that there should be no new customs or regulatory barriers in the Irish Sea. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds added new conditions on Wednesday night, insisting that the backstop must be temporary and that it could not lead over time to greater ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The DUP has no objection to SPS checks being conducted at ports as they are now. So the future of the British backstop proposal will partly depend on whether checks on goods in the market can reasonably be construed as a new barrier in the Irish Sea.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The footballer, 33, has angrily denied Ms Mayorga’s claim.Nike called the allegations disturbing and said it would “continue to monitor the situation closely”. EA Sports, which also has a contract with the player, made similar comments. Earlier on Thursday the Portugal national football team’s announced it was leaving its captain out of its next two games came after police in Las Vegas announced they were re-opening their investigation into Ms Mayorga\u0027s claim.The footballer has said he is keen to clear his name but added his clear conscience allows him to calmly await the results of any and all investigations.Ronaldo will miss Portugal’s second game in the Uefa Nations League in Poland next Thursday and a friendly match in Glasgow against Scotland three days later.Fernando Santos, Portugal\u0027s coach, said Ronaldo would also not be called up for the next round of international games in November. Mr Santos said the decision was taken after a discussion between himself, Ronaldo and the head of the Portuguese football federation.“We agreed the player wouldn’t be available, wouldn’t be an option for selection,” Mr Santos said. “For the next two squad selections, this one and the one next month, Ronaldo won’t be with us.”He added he expected Ronaldo, who with 154 caps is his country\u0027s most experienced player, will return to playing for Portugal eventually.Ronaldo has already missed Portugal\u0027s first two post-World Cup games as he completed an £88.7m move to Italian club Juventus. He was spotted arriving at the club\u0027s practice session on Thursday.Juventus\u0026#39 Cristiano Ronaldo drives his car as he leaves after completing a training sessionJuventus released a statement on Thursday evening supporting their player.Ms Mayorga has filed a lawsuit against Ronaldo seeking to void a $375,000 non-disclosure agreement she alleges she was coerced into signing.She claims the footballer raped her in a Las Vegas hotel penthouse suite in June 2009 and is now seeking more than $200,000 in damages.The player has vehemently denied the accusation, saying rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in.The Las Vegas politan Police Department said it had responded to a call alleging a sexual assault on June 13, 2009 and confirmed it has now reopened the case. Palms was the location of the now-closed Rain Nightclub, where soccer star Ronaldo Cristiano and Kathryn Mayorga met on June 13, 2009In a statement to The , the police department stated: The Las Vegas politan Police Department responded to a call of a sexual assault on June 13, 2009.  At the time the report was taken, the victim did not provide detectives with the location of the incident or suspect description.  A medical exam was conducted.As of September 2018, the case has been reopened and our detectives are following up on information being provided by the victim.Police have refused to say whether the footballer is the subject of an investigation.Yazidi activist and Congolese gynecologist awarded Nobel Peace Prize#MeToo one year on, has it made a real impact?Royal family tree: Where Princess Eugenie fits into the line of succession to the British throneA Brexit deal can be done in two weeks, Leo Varadkar says, as crunch talks on the Irish backstop intensifyDonald Tusk offers up Canada +++, but it\u0026#39s not the deal Brexiteers think it isZimbabwe launches vaccine drive in bid to bring cholera outbreak under controlAmy Schumer and Emily Ratajkowski among 300 arrested in Kavanaugh protests British man killed by sea snake while working on trawler in AustraliaBrett Kavanaugh claims he is \u0026#39independent, impartial\u0026#39 but \u0026#39emotional\u0026#39 in highly unusual op-edComment: Chequers is a ploy to keep the UK in the EU and would lead to a deeper constitutional crisisJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39I want to impress my grandparents this week\u0026#39Dog hide tax starting to bite for North KoreansComment: Free speech is crumbling under the weight of the young’s easy outrageChina hits back after Mike Pence claims Beijing wants to kick Trump out of White HouseHigh street retailers are damaging the environment with \u0026#39fast fashion\u0026#39, MPs warnWaitrose drivers to unpack shopping in customers\u0026#39 homes when they are outPeople Like Us review, Union Theatre: Julie Burchill\u0026#39s Brexit play offers a close union with boredom  Lager-primed laughing stock: how elite Russian hackers got caught red-handed by Dutch surveillanceWomen have wrongly been told they are pregnant as thousands of tests recalled We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/01/TELEMMGLPICT000171262693_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeK8ehqBZJSTiVTgumtathbH8AD1LYTdJsoz8pklmEgw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parents send older siblings sit childs 11 plus breathtakingly","story":"This isn’t just mad.

A further four came from Thailand, two infections were from the Philippines, a similar number originated in Malaysia and single cases were reported from Indonesia, Singapore, St Lucia, the United States and Angola, according to CDC statistics.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityYazidi activist and Congolese gynecologist awarded Nobel Peace Prize#MeToo one year on, has it made a real impact?Royal family tree: Where Princess Eugenie fits into the line of succession to the British throneCristiano Ronaldo\u0026#39s Nike contract at risk following \u0026#39disturbing\u0026#39 rape allegationA Brexit deal can be done in two weeks, Leo Varadkar says, as crunch talks on the Irish backstop intensifyDonald Tusk offers up Canada +++, but it\u0026#39s not the deal Brexiteers think it isZimbabwe launches vaccine drive in bid to bring cholera outbreak under controlAmy Schumer and Emily Ratajkowski among 300 arrested in Kavanaugh protests British man killed by sea snake while working on trawler in AustraliaBrett Kavanaugh claims he is \u0026#39independent, impartial\u0026#39 but \u0026#39emotional\u0026#39 in highly unusual op-edJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39I want to impress my grandparents this week\u0026#39Comment: Chequers is a ploy to keep the UK in the EU and would lead to a deeper constitutional crisisDog hide tax starting to bite for North KoreansComment: Free speech is crumbling under the weight of the young’s easy outrageChina hits back after Mike Pence claims Beijing wants to kick Trump out of White HouseHigh street retailers are damaging the environment with \u0026#39fast fashion\u0026#39, MPs warnWaitrose drivers to unpack shopping in customers\u0026#39 homes when they are outPeople Like Us review, Union Theatre: Julie Burchill\u0026#39s Brexit play offers a close union with boredom  Lager-primed laughing stock: how elite Russian hackers got caught red-handed by Dutch surveillanceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000176574683_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYWNJspVvOUVBAuV2D2wK5tXshSCEjiFHc5qxWUFxtts.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"brett kavanaugh pens highly unusual op edi independent impartial","story":"Judge Brett Kavanaugh testifies during his US Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearingBrett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump\u0027s controversial pick for the US Supreme Court, declared himself independent, impartial on Thursday in a highly unusual plea following criticism of his performance at a Senate committee hearing on sexual assault allegations against him.I am an independent, impartial judge, said the headline of an opinion piece he wrote in The Wall Street Journal as the Senate moves towards a weekend confirmation vote.Mr Kavanaugh penned the defence of his performance during last week\u0027s Judiciary Committee hearing at which he denied the allegations, made by a California university professor.Christine Blasey Ford said he drunkenly groped her and attempted to take her clothes off in what she believed was a rape attempt when they were teenagers decades ago.The 53-year-old judge made what were in effect closing arguments by acknowledging that he became very emotional when forcefully denying the allegations.Christine Blasey Ford is sworn in before testifying the Senate Judiciary Committee, September 27 2018I said a few things I should not have said, he wrote in an op-ed published Thursday evening. More than 650 law professors signed a letter to the Senate, published in The New York Times on Wednesday, saying that at the hearing Mr Kavanaugh did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament required for the Supreme Court, and urged that he not be confirmed.Thousands of  protesters rallied outside the Supreme Court and entered a Senate office building on Thursday.  Hundreds of demonstrators were arrested, including actress Amy Schumer.My hearing testimony was forceful and passionate. That is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me, Mr Kavanaugh wrote in the Journal.I do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defence judge. I am a pro-law judge.He added that the country\u0027s top court must never be viewed as a partisan institution.In his testimony last week, Mr Kavanaugh complained about a calculated and orchestrated political hit fuelled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.He called the campaign against his nomination a circus and spoke of a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything, to block my confirmation.US President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, MinnesotaOn the same evening as the op-ed was published Mr Trump accused Democrats of rage-fuelled resistance in the battle over his Supreme Court nominee at a packed election rally in Minnesota.Speaking to crowds at a civic centre in Rochester, Mr Trump praised Mr Kavanaugh.Of Democrats, he said: Their rage-fueled resistance is starting to backfire at a level nobody has ever seen before, adding Do we love it?

Dieter Zetsche, outgoing head of the brand, told Paris Motor Show attendees that he had begun negotiations with Nissan regarding potentially using its Sunderland plant to build Mercedes-Benz cars. “Before Brexit there was one project where we were looking at an option of producing cars in Sunderland together,” he said. Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler formed an alliance with Nissan and Renault in 2010. Earlier this year, Nissan announced that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at the Sunderland operation, due to falling demand for diesel vehicles. Mr Zetsche shared no further details about the now-abandoned plan, The Times reported. A number of other carmakers issued warnings at the Paris event, with Toyota stating that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a temporary stoppage in UK production, primarily at its Burnaston plant. Toyota warns no-deal Brexit would stop UK productionAston Martin cuts target share price for stock market listingUK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardUK car sales plunged 20 per cent in SeptemberJohan van Zyl, the Japanese company’s Europe president, said it was difficult to predict how long the stoppage period would last. Meanwhile, Maxime Picat, executive vice president for Europe at Vauxhall owner PSA, said leaving the EU with no deal would disrupt production. “We’ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites’ competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future,” he said. “But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures.“If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.”Several carmakers have called for Brexit negotiators to avoid a no-deal scenario, warning that such a departure would hit production and investment in the market. BMW recently said it would bring a planned shutdown of its Oxford plant forward to begin on the same day the UK leaves the EU, in a bid to minimise the potential disruption a no-deal Brexit would create.Meanwhile, Honda has said that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, has previously warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour.

Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Dieter Zetsche, outgoing head of the brand, told Paris Motor Show attendees that he had begun negotiations with Nissan regarding potentially using its Sunderland plant to build Mercedes-Benz cars. “Before Brexit there was one project where we were looking at an option of producing cars in Sunderland together,” he said. Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler formed an alliance with Nissan and Renault in 2010. Earlier this year, Nissan announced that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at the Sunderland operation, due to falling demand for diesel vehicles. Mr Zetsche shared no further details about the now-abandoned plan, The Times reported. A number of other carmakers issued warnings at the Paris event, with Toyota stating that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a temporary stoppage in UK production, primarily at its Burnaston plant. Toyota warns no-deal Brexit would stop UK productionAston Martin cuts target share price for stock market listingUK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardUK car sales plunged 20 per cent in SeptemberJohan van Zyl, the Japanese company’s Europe president, said it was difficult to predict how long the stoppage period would last. Meanwhile, Maxime Picat, executive vice president for Europe at Vauxhall owner PSA, said leaving the EU with no deal would disrupt production. “We’ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites’ competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future,” he said. “But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures.“If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.”Several carmakers have called for Brexit negotiators to avoid a no-deal scenario, warning that such a departure would hit production and investment in the market. BMW recently said it would bring a planned shutdown of its Oxford plant forward to begin on the same day the UK leaves the EU, in a bid to minimise the potential disruption a no-deal Brexit would create.Meanwhile, Honda has said that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, has previously warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But\u0026nbspnow, once the Tory conference is over, we should get down to business.”Speaking alongside\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, the Irish president, Mr Tusk made clear the EU remained “united behind Ireland” in its determination to prevent a return to border posts and checks.But he also made clear his anger at the delay to Theresa May’s promised fresh border proposals – linking it to a reluctance to risk a backlash at the Tory conference.In Birmingham, Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, triggered fury across the EU by accusing it of trying to keep the UK in a “prison” with behaviour similar to the Soviet Union.After the Salzburg summit, the prime minister accused Mr Tusk of showing disrespect, but he tuned that accusation on the UK, saying: “In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return.“Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The one known as\u0026nbsp802.11ac is WiFi 5, and\u0026nbsp802.11n is WiFi\u0026nbsp4.“For nearly two decades, WiFi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest WiFi,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “WiFi Alliance is excited to introduce WiFi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and WiFi users easily understand the WiFi generation supported by their device or connection.”As well as being easier for people to understand, the new name will be able to fit into screens on phones and computers. That will let people know how they are connected to WiFi, for instance, and tell them whether they should expect faster or slower speeds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I think when she has worn 50s style dresses if you look back, I think she wore one for the races. They are the sort of styling that really suits her figure.She added: \u0026ldquoI think 50s is quite fashionable right now if I am perfectly honest with you.

She might well be in strapless. But I think she will be much more floaty, much more romantic. Just much more of that softness and of that young girl romance.Eugenie and her sister Beatrice are well known for their eclectic style. But the wedding dress designer said Eugenie is likely to follow royal tradition with her gown with an added modern twist.Ms Castigliano said: \u0026ldquoIt seems that everybody just falls into the line of protocol.\u0026ldquoSo it is highly likely she will wear a sleeve. And I can only imagine that she maybe will wear a sleeve and if she does change or maybe she\u0026rsquoll have a dress that can be adapted so that she maybe will be able to take the sleeves off so that she has a strapless dress in the evening.\u0026ldquoAnd she has got lovely skin and a beautiful bust line. She\u0026rsquod look beautiful in a strapless dress that would cut well.The ceremony will take place at St George\u0026rsquos Chapel in Windsor Castle, the same venue that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said their vows in May.Over 850 guests have allegedly been invited \u0026ndash more than St George\u0026rsquos chapel 800 person capacity allows.The celebration will last for two days, with the second day more casual and a high celebrity turn-out expected.The wedding will be broadcast as part of a special edition of ITV\u0026rsquos This Morning show.The lavish nuptials are set to cost the British taxpayer an eye-watering \u0026pound2.7million, according to Royal expert Hamish Shephard.He said security will cost \u0026pound2million, floristry \u0026pound100,000, music \u0026pound25,000 and the dress \u0026pound200,000.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But wait till it comes out of wage packets. Skint workers won’t thank the Tories for bailing out the health ­service.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whoever convinced her it would be dead cool to walk on stage at the party conference and jig about to an Abba song needs a bit of invasive brain surgery, right now.It was like a remake of Re-Animator, or Night Of The Living Dead.There’s no point in Theresa trying to tell us she’s the le and soul of the party and actually a bloody good laugh.We know she isn’t. She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose. And you’ll wake up to find John McDonnell is in charge of your finances and Diane Abbott is Home Secretary.Come on — surely that should concentrate the mind a little Hero of the week is Jane Lunnon, head of a girls’ school in South London.She has stuck the boot into “image-obsessed” reality TV – especially that coven of gurning and pouting imbeciles in Love Island, such as Megan Barton Hanson.Such programmes are “incredibly damaging” to young people, she reckons, calling them “trivial nonsense”.I think Jane is right. And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers. She says they didn’t give spectators enough protection.This is ludicrous. What were they supposed to do And what will happen is that in future crowds will be kept even further back from the action. Just because of one horrible accident.Wait until the same thing happens in cricket...The uni magazine said: “It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues. BSL clapping – or, jazz hands – would be a more inclusive form of expression.”With anxiety or sensory issues  What is wrong with these people They are “triggered” by almost everything.

Problem is, I can’t stand them, the middle class.And the thought of nearly four billion people eating avocado on toast while doing Pilates then listening to Coldplay in their Volvo XCs makes me feel terribly queasy.The human race is being taken over by the legions of the smug.

It is dirty and unhygienic — a report out this week said it is a breeding ground for bugs.There is even a version of Monopoly with debit cards instead of notes. And last month we told you of the  century The Boot pub in Freston, Suffolk, the first boozer in the country to go cashless.This looming death has been around for a while. In August, the Bank of England said it was considering phasing out p and p coins. And ATMs are closing at a rate of  a month.Just  per cent of payments are cash, down from  per cent in . And those payments only account for three per cent in terms of the value of how much is spent.Paying on card has been on the rise ever since Barclaycard launched in , but cards too face being eclipsed by payments on mobile phones. Either way, both mean we need cash less. And that is not a bad thing, right Getting rid of cash would hit criminals and tax evaders hard as they do business in cash to make it harder for authorities to track the movement of money.Businesses would rejoice because they would not have to pay security guards to transport money and would not have to spend ages counting and bagging it.Some also reckon it is easier to keep a tab on finances when spending on cards or apps. You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that. Like many, I prefer to give my tips in cash so I know the waiter or waitress gets it all.Charity collectors often have card machines now but collections for most churches, schools and small local good causes still rely on tins and the rattle of coins.Cash may well be dying out, but I still make sure I always keep some coins in my pocket just in case. And I have older relatives who still feel most comfortable with coins and notes.So until we have a population where everyone feels happy when using a card or phone, I will be rooting against a completely cashless Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The venom is not particularly potent.“The schools are being treated and fumigated and we are working with the schools to ensure that children can continue to receive an education whilst their school is closed.Pupils are being set work via the schools and will remain in contact with schools.“We are asking all our schools and nurseries to proactively check their premises carefully for these spiders andthey see any signs, then contact environmental health or pest control.”False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.Millions of  widows, Britains most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about mm in size.Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000439038144-e1538602636221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may dancing abba trolled guy verhofstadt","story":"Brussels’ chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas was asked about the Prime Minister’s on-stage antics yesterday, when she walked out to “Dancing Queen”.He responded with the names of several other of the Swedish band’s songs – adding that “breaking up is never easy, I know”.It came after Mrs May was last night trolled by EU Parliament boss Guy Verhofstadt, who evidently missed the funny side of her light-hearted move at the Tory conference in Birmingham.On Twitter last night he sneered: While dancing to ABBA today, PM May overlooked the fact that Bjorn from ABBA called Brexit a disaster.He shared a link to the singer discussing why he wanted Britain to stay in the bloc, which was filmed before the referendum in  where most Brits opted to leave.But Winston Churchills grandson Nicholas Soames was quick to hit back with a tweet saying: #ohbuggeroff!Today Mr Schinas was asked by a reporter an Abba-themed question, whether he would: “Take a chance on May or is Britain facing its Waterloo ”And he replied in kind, saying: My my, how can I resist you.

But this could hamper Britains ability to do trade deals with other countries outside the bloc.Currently the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is open with no checks on goods or people.Ireland and the UK are in a common travel area of passport-free movement.And as they are both in the EU single market, there is no restriction on goods and no tarfs.Leaders in London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels are keen to avoid a hard border after Brexit — when the UK has vowed to leave the single market and customs union.This would mean border checks being reintroduced to monitor movement between jurisdictions operating under the two dferent regulatory systems.There were fears this could have jeopardised the Good Friday Agreement peace deal.Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he could block Brexit talks unless the UK signed a formal agreement not to have a hard border.If this happened Ireland’s businesses could be left paying tarfs on imports and exports with its biggest single trading partner, Britain.Some had suggested moving border checks across the Irish Sea — but Unionists and Brexiteers rejected that, saying it undermines the integrity of the UK.Northern Ireland parties including representatives from Sinn Fein and Alliance will meet Mr Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt today for talks in Brussels, and the DUP and UUP will have similar talks next week.But no new checks will be accepted by Theresa Mays DUP allies, Nigel Dodds says today.Its important ... that there are no economic barriers put up, tarfs, checks or anything  between one part of the United Kingdom and the other.And Irish Foreign Minister Simon COveney said that any agreement cant rely on the devolved Government because they are not currently sitting.Any agreements that are made and signed off on are between the British government and the European Union and that will be a legal text of a treaty that has to be fully legally operable, whether or not there is devolved government in Northern Ireland, he said this morning.TODAY: Talks between the EU negotiator Michel Barnier and Northern Ireland parties Sinn Fein and Alliance get underway in Brussels.MONDAY: Mr Barnier meets with DUP politicians over the Northern Irish border. British officials work on the wording of their new offer to avoid a hard border.OCTOBER: Theresa May attends an EU Council summit where a Brexit deal is hoped to be thrashed out. Officials are still working towards this deadline.NOVEMBER: If no deal is reached in October, an emergency summit has been pencilled in for a weeks later. Both sides say this is the last chance to secure an agreement.DECEMBER: The PM will take her deal back to MPs to vote on in the House of Commons. Its expected to be a vote between her deal and no deal at all, but some MPs want to force her to renegotiate, and others are demanding another referendum.MARCH: Britain formally leaves the European Union, anda deal is done, the -month transition period will begin.This morning the Irish European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee said the will was there between both sides and she was confident that new plans to deal with the thorny issue of the Irish border would soon be revealed.She told Radio s Today programme: We have less than two weeks before the next European Council meeting, whatever the deal is, should be brought forward to Michel Barnier so we have time to look at it.I have confidence on the basis I think the Prime Minister wants to reach agreement.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The  EU leaders are set to discuss Brexit over dinner on October th, and Britain has been told the pieces of a orce deal must be in place by the start of that week. The “Canada+++” deal suggested by the EU would keep Britain out of the Single Market and Customs Union, but would guarantee a free trade deal and cooperation on security matters. But Mr Tusk’s plan would keep Northern Ireland inside EU economic rules, something Mrs May has strongly rejected. In her speech on Wednesday, Mrs May repeated her call for the EU to show Britain “respect in the negotiations.  But Mr Tusk hit back, tweeting: “From the very Beginning, the EU offer has been a Canada+++ deal. Much further-reaching on trade, internal security and foreign policy cooperation. This is a true measure of respect. And this offer remains in place.” Speaking at Tory conference this week, Jacob Rees-Mogg referred to such a deal, also referred to as Super Canada - as Canada Supercalragilistiexpialidocious - which as you all know is a word developed by a nanny and nannies are jolly good things. Mr Tusk also hit back at Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who compared the EU to the Soviet Union in his speech to Tory conference on Tuesday, saying it was as “unwise as it is insulting. Asked whether Mr Hunt should resign over his comments, made during his speech to Tory Conference in Birmingham, Mr Tusk replied: “Thats not my problem.” At a press briefing in Brussels, Mr Tusk said: In respecting our partners, we expect the same in .  “Comparing the EU to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours. “The European Union is about freedom and human rights, prosperity and peace, le without fear, it is about democracy and pluralism - a continent without internal borders and walls.  “As the President of the European Council and someone who spent half his le in the Soviet bloc, I know what I am talking about. Standing beside Irish premier Leo Varadkar he slammed British politicians for rejecting EU proposals to keep Northern Ireland inside EU economic rules. He said: Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound attractive but they do not facilitate agreement.  “Every actor in this process has their dignity and confrontation in this field will not lead to anything good. “No one can expect that because of Brexit, the EU will give up its fundamental values and key interests. Meanwhile, the boss of RBS bank warned a no-deal Brexit could plunge the UK economy into recession. Ross McEwan, chief executive of the majority taxpayer-owned bank, told the BBC a “bad Brexit” could result in “zero or negative” economic growth. He said such poor growth would hit RBS’ share price. He also said the bank was becoming careful about lending to certain sectors of the economy - particularly retail and construction. RBS is still % owned by the taxpayer following its bailout  years ago.

Brits are now being advised they should renew their passports as soon as possibletheyre in their last year - or risk being barred from entering Europe in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government warned on September . Ministers published documents confirming we will need to have passports that are valid for AT LEAST six monthswe want guaranteed entry into countries in the EU. That means some valid British passports will be completely useless in our neighbouring countrieswe leave without striking a deal.  Basically, the documents say that without a deal, British citizens risk being treated the same as those from outside the EU in the borderless Schengen zone. The documents state: If you plan to travel to the Schengen area after  March , to avoid any possibility of your adult British passport not complying with the Schengen Border Code we suggest that you check the issue date and make sure your passport is no older than  years and  months on the day of travel. For example,you’re planning to travel to the Schengen area on  March , your passport should have an issue date on or after  October . If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel. These same rules apply to both adult and childrens passports - and the government recommends renewing as soon as possible as the passport issuing service can get busy.

Worryingly, this  belief may be the reason why only  per cent of Brits are planning to be vaccinated against the virus this year. Ten per cent ly think going outside in the cold, especially with wet hair, can make you vulnerable to illness. Jane Devenish, pharmacist at Well Pharmacy, which commissioned the research, said: “Being cold or having wet hair doesn’t give you flu. “The only way to catch flu is by being exposed to the flu virus, and the virus peaks in winter. “However, there is some evidence that having a lower body temperature can lower your ability to fight off viruses, so listen to your grandmother’s advice and wrap up warm.”  The study also revealed the two most common methods used by Brits to try to ward off flu are dosing up on Vitamin C, and drinking a ‘hot toddy’ – a warm whiskey drink with honey and lemon. And people were equally confused about what to do when they were unlucky enough to get a bout of flu. One in four think you should sweat out the fever, nearly a fth believe you should starve it, and  per cent think the illness can be ‘cured’ by chicken soup. Jane Devenish added: “There is no evidence that vitamin C prevents flu, and alcohol actually lowers your immune system, lowering your body’s ability to ward off viruses like flu. “Sweating is the body’s natural way of lowering its temperature, and it’s important to reduce a fever by keeping cool and taking paracetamol.” “I would never recommend starving yourself. Chicken soup, like any fluids, is great for staying hydrated and nourishing your body which definitely helps recovery, but unfortunately nothing can really ‘cure’ flu.”It also emerged despite the fact that  per cent of Brits surveyed via OnePoll had experienced flu,  per cent have no intention of getting the flu jab this year."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who only went toilet","story":"NewsWoman who only went to the toilet ONCE a week was so bloated by mystery illness that people thought she was pregnantEXCLUSIVE: Kayleigh Henning suffered from bloating, constipation and abdominal cramps for more than  yearsShareCommentsByLiz Dunphy:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsKayleigh Henning suffered from bloating, constipation and abdominal cramps for more than  years, pictured here with husband Robert \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who was so bloated by a mystery illness that people thought she was pregnant is now expecting her first child after beating illness by avoiding six common foods . Kayleigh Henning suffered from bloating, constipation and agonising abdominal cramps for more than  years. Her condition was so bad she could only go to the toilet once a week. Sleepless nights were spent curled up on the bathroom floor in agony while multiple doctors failed to correctly diagnose her problem. Kayleigh said: It was so annoying because everyone just assumed I was pregnant and wouldnt leave that alone - I was definitely not pregnant! Id wear tights or anything like that which normally fit me for the whole day. By the end of the day, Id be very uncomfortable and Id have pressure marks from my trousers or tights imprinted on my skin.  “It was pretty painful, which affects you mentally. You feel like you just dont want to go out anywhere. Id often find Id experience diarrhoea on nights out and that is obviously pretty embarrassing. So many times I wouldnt feel like going out. Because I was constipated, Id be going to the toilet only once a week. That in itself is disconcerting because youre thinking in the back of your head why havent I been to the toilet . I probably endured the problems all through my s, even at university. Id been to see my GP mainly because of constipation problems and Id get given fibre gel drinks, she says. Kayleighs situation came to a head when she graduated from Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, and moved from Scotland to Northern Ireland that week.  “The stress of that culminated in my first visit to AE. I was really worried I wouldnt be able to fly back for the graduation ceremony because I was in so much pain. I was just curled up on the bathroom floor, because it was cold and the best place to be.” Tiredness and depression, caused by her painful and irritable symptoms, had became part of daily le for the then -year-old.  Doctors put the symptoms down to Irritable Bowel Syndromeand prescribed a drug they thought would help. Kayleigh went home and had her first nights sleep in - days, but she developed an allergic reaction to the drug and had to rush back to AE. On most occasions [at the GP] I dont know whether it was ignorance or easiness, I always got these fibre gel drinks which I used for quite a while until another GP told me to come off them because they were not a long-term solution. But then Kayleighs personal trainer mentioned food intolerances and said she could fast-track an elimination diet with a test which analyses IgG antibody reactionsto up to  food and drink ingredients provided by the company YorkTest . Kayleigh said: My trainer was intolerant to a few things and didnt know until she took the test. Since she has eliminated those things from her diet, she has felt so much better.” Kayleighs husband, Robert, has ME [chronic fatigue syndrome] and was also going through a rough time but couldnt understand why. Kayleigh says: Hes had a few allergy tests, but never any intolerance tests. He had already eliminated gluten and cows milk from his diet. His lunch consisted of a chicken breast, potatoes and an egg every day.  “Interestingly when he took the intolerance test, which I got for him as a Christmas present, he found he was intolerant to eggs! So as soon as he eliminated the eggs he felt better as well.” Although Robert had around  intolerances, from eggs to raspberries, the message from specialists was not to panic - and even that some intolerances can be reintroduced six months after eliminating them from a diet. Kayleighs test - the YorkTest FoodDrink Scan programme - also threw up several surprises, revealing she had reactions to cow’s milk, egg white, lentils, yeast, buckwheat and gluten. “I’m not surprised by cow’s milk or gluten and avoided them as much as possible, because I knew that they didnt agree with me. I was surprised by lentils - I loved making lentil soup and sweet potato and lentil stew - and of course lentils are seen as healthy,” she says. My borderline list had things like walnut, rhubarb and avocado, which I ate all the time as well. What the experts advise is to eliminate everything over a period of six months then you can start to reintroduce things. We dont necessarily do that, but we can enjoy things on occasions and not suffer because were not eating them every day. The test involves sending a finger-prick blood sample to a laboratory for analysis followed by up to two consultations with a nutritional therapist.  Kayleigh says: “I found the nutritional consultation very helpful. Particularly when it came to finding alternatives, especially for garlic! “She was able to provide much more specic information on what to avoid based on food groups and gave some great alternatives and recipes,” she says. As soon as Kayleigh started her elimination diet, she immediately felt better. “As I had already removed gluten, wheat and cow’s milk from my diet, I found it relatively easy to remove the remaining foods. The one I found most dficult was yeast. “I definitely feel much better, and I know when I have eaten something that I am intolerant to immediately. I havent been constipated since, I bloat much less, and I don’t experience the same stomach cramps, provided I steer clear of my trigger foods. I do eat the odd food I probably shouldnt, but at least I know the reason for any discomfort. I am so much happier, consistently comfortable and have regular bowel movements, too.

If they had known a camera was hidden inside that Bible and that he was taking these incredible pictures of le inside Stalag Luft IVB, Terry would almost certainly have been executed. His ultimate fate is unknown but the images he took survive in an album compiled by fellow PoW David Courtney. In one shot, French prisoners bow their heads in prayer at a church service, while another shows row upon row of tents that were home to many of the , inmates near Muhlberg in Saxony. At the funeral of a British serviceman who was executed, possibly for trying to escape, a dozen German soldiers are pictured firing their rles in a respectful salute over the airman’s coffin – despite being responsible for his death.  On a more light-hearted note, another photo shows a group of men all dressed – convincingly – as women for a theatrical prodshyshyuction staged to keep up morale in the camp.

Terry Hunt had been a film cameraman before the war and went on RAF sorties to make newsreels.

Anatoly Moskvin dug up the mummied the girls who were all aged between three and -years-old. The -year-old even dressed them in knee- boots, stockings and clothes, before putting make-up on their faces. He also wedged music boxes inside their rib cages. Journalist Moskvin was caught some six years ago as he was the main suspect for vandalising Muslim cemeteries in the city of Nizhny Novgorod in western Russia.  But when the cops entered his flat, where he lived with his parents, they were shocked to find  mummied dolls of the dead little girls. He reportedly spent almost a decade living with some of the corpses, with the families of the girls not realising the coffins of their children had been empty for a long time. He has confessed to  counts of digging up the graves and abusing the little girls in them and later told police that he was in fact waiting for science to find ways of resuscitating them. He has spent the last five of years in a mental hospital where he was receiving mandatory treatment but his doctors are now said to believe Moskvin is ready to go home. The medical experts are reportedly convinced he is no longer dangerous. Another medical exam is reportedly due to take place and the next court hearing on Moskvins case is scheduled for October .  Ten-year-old Olga Chardymovas body was one the girls stolen from what was supposed to be her final resting place. Olgas mother, Natalia Chardymova, , is outraged at the official request made to release the evil man from his secure psychiatric hospital. Natalia - who now has a son aged nine - said she was appalled that Moskvin could be freed. “This creature brought fear, terror and panic into my ,” she said. “I shudder to think that he will have freedom to go where he wants.” He had warned the court that ‘I willto my girls’,he was ever freed, she said. But this now seems forgotten. “Neither my family nor the families of the other victims will be able to sleep peacefully. “He needs to be kept under surveillance. “I insist on a le sentence….only under medical supervision, without the right of free movement.  “Years have passed but my attitude to Moskvin has not changed at all - horror, fear and panic. “Hell cause a lot more suffering to someone ….” Natalia said she feels “shock, horror and fear - even my voice trembles now as I speak.” She said: “These are my fears, my worries… I don’t want repetition of what happened in the past. “It was very scary.” However, it is believed the court is unlikely to seek the views of bereaved parents. “He deprived me of the right to visit my daughter, to visit her grave: as it turned out, for years I visited an empty coffin,” she added. Little Olga was murdered in . She had begged her mother to be allowed to walk on her own to her granny’s flat in the next apartment block. Im ten already. I can go myself, she pleaded. Natalia relented and Olga went out with her favourite green bag and blue umbrella, never to be seen alive again. A drug addict waiting in the lobby of her block had forced her back up to the top floor, and robbed her of her earrings, and because she tried to escape, cracked her over the head with a metal bar. Despite searches for her body, Olgas remains with the umbrella and bag were not found for five months wedged behind pipes in the blocks attic. We buried her on  October , Natalia said.  “I could never imagine that almost exactly ten years later, on the  October , I would open her grave with the police, and find her remains had vanished. Her coffin was empty, with a hole at the top from which he had pulled the remains. You cant begin to imagine it, that somebody would touch the grave of your child, the most holy place in this world for you.” She added: My girl had been murdered,anyone deserved to rest in peace, she did, but instead her grave had been robbed.” I still find it hard to grasp the scale of his sickening ‘work’ but for nine years he was living with my mummied daughter in his bedroom. I had her for ten years, he had her for nine.” Moskvin’s mother Elvira, then , told police after he was arrested: We saw these dolls but we did not suspect there were dead bodies inside. We thought it was his hobby to make such big dolls and did not see anything wrong with it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"thai caveman beds dozens attractive","story":"NewsThai Caveman beds dozens of attractive female backpackers on island and boasts of exploitsChatupoom Losiri, , has shared images of women sleeping naked in his cave in the Full Moon Party island of Koh PhanganShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video meet-the-cave-man-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA self-proclaimed caveman has boasted online about his years spent bedding dozens of young attractive backpackers he seduced on a Thai island.Lothario Chatupoom Losiri posted pictures of several young woman sleeping naked on his bed on Facebook , claiming they had spent the night together.The -year-old also claimed to have bedded a young Russian woman he met outside a grocery store. But furious locals have voiced their fury at his antics, calling for him to be evicted and prompting police to search his home in the Full Moon Party island of Koh Phangan. Despite claims that he lacked decency after his online bragging, no evidence of any wrongdoing was uncovered in the search. Chatupoom calls himself the Thai Caveman - a persona he uses to pick up women.  After posting a picture of a group naked women sleeping, he wrote that he was very tired from the previous evening but still woke up to drink coffee and meditate while they slept. The cavemans antics sparked outrage from locals who accused him of showing a lack of decency after dozens more images emerged of women he had taken back to his cave. Police arrived at the cave, a former tin mine, yesterday and searched for anything suspicious but found nothing. They admitted that Chatupoom had not broken the law but said they would monitor the situation.  Koh Phangan Sherf Kairik Kraisong said: Officials on Koh Phangan have investigated the situation and performed a background check on the person, who was originally domiciled in Bangkok. He graduated with a degree from Silpakorn University. Koh Phangan district has made an inquiry to the landowner whether he will continue to let Mr Chatupoom live in the area or ask him to leave. Now there are no complaints. If there is a complaint, the officers can take legal action. This situation is precarious and risky, so I sent the staff to check and talk with Mr Chatupoom. Speaking to reporters, Chatupoom denied that he had done anything wrong and said that all of the women who visited his cave were there of their own choice.  He said: I came to Koh Phangan to play music but shortly after the band broke up. Now I earn a living by painting art and selling it to tourists. The women who sleep here, there is no compulsion in any way. None of the women are forced to do anything, and sometimes we dont have sex. Sometimes we just hug until morning. They are all happy and Im happy, too.

It comes from nowhere,” he added.“I think we started really well. We had a great chance at the beginning and, obviously, we miss it. We concede a stupid goal on a set-piece where we need to be smarter.“We get back into the game with a great goal and, in that moment, I thought we were OK but again we concede a stupid goal again with a cross from the side.“Even then at - it’s bad but I thought ‘look we’ve got  minutes to turn it round’ and then we concede quite early.“The red card for Stewart Murdoch finished it.

I won it first time round at Cove and then again at Formartine.“But we’re not dwelling on the past, it would be good to get this one under the belt this early in the season.“They are happy memories the first time at Cove we beat Buckie and then at Formartine we beat Inverurie.“It’s always good to win cup finals, whoever you are playing for. You want to win every cup you enter and it would be sweet to get something in the trophy cabinet early in the season.“I would love to make it a hat-trick in the cup.“The last couple of years are in our minds. We’ve done well to get to the finals the last two years.“Probably on both occasions we’ve been unlucky not to win then. After losing, it does give us motivation to go and put things right this year.”Park expects a tough game against Dee, with the Junior side eliminating Inverurie Locos, Aberdeen Reserves and Turrf United on route to the final.He also expects to have some banter ahead of the game with former team-mates Dean Lawrie and Jamie Watt – now with Dee.He added: “We played them in the final of the Shield last season and we know they are a good side. They’ve signed Dean Lawrie from ourselves so that will have strengthened them and they’ve started really well again this season.“Jamie Watt is co-manager and we know what type of guy he is.“He’ll have them fit and motivated and we look forward to playing them because it will be a good match.“There will be banter. I’m sure the texts will be flying back and forth before the game.“They will be looking forward to it just as us. It will be a good occasion on a Friday night.”Cove and Banks o’ Dee have met recently in a cup final.In February they faced one another in the final of the Aberdeenshire Shield.After a back and forth affair Cove eventually ran out - winners.Park featured that night, and he believes that John Sheran’s team can take confidence from beating Dee recently in a cup final.He said: “Last season can give us confidence, it was - and it was a good game.“We’re confident going into any game at the moment, having won  out of  in the league.“We’re playing well and we’ve got a strong squad so we are confident, but we know we’re in for a tough game.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.There was some suspicion over the intentions of health and social care managers at the recent meeting of Mid Argyll Health and Care Forum .Members felt their recent behaviour might be a precursor to changing the forum set-up to make it saferand more homogenised across the region.But there was also strong feeling the HCF should be better attended by public representatives such as community councillors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside  minutes after sloppy errors.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net.

Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine. The Duke’s younger brother Lord Richard Wellesley lives on the Knockdolian estate nearby. This was their maternal grandfather Douglas McConnel’s property. South Ayrshire Council will reach a decision later on whether to grant listed consent.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Since then South Ayrshire Council has tried and failed to negotiate with him in an attempt to keep the rat-infested building safe. Two dangerous building notices were issued.

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”.

Cottingley, near Bingley in Yorkshire.The two girls, like so many children then and now, believed in fairies and set out to prove their existence, little knowing that their practical joke would stir such controversy and fool such eminent figures as Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Borrowing Elsiersquos fatherrsquos Midg quarter-plate camera, and with the use of coloured paper

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

In our view, putting this substation on the foreshore will detract from the possibility to fully develop the site.The Reporter will now consider they representations before making a decision on the next stage of her investigation.Local ward Councillor Lachlan Bruce praised the community council representatives for their presentations to the Reporter.He added: ldquoI was very disappointed by the applicantrsquos dismissive views on what has been suggested for by the local communities for the site.ldquoLots of ideas have been put forward that would create jobs and opportunities on the site and they should be given all due considerations and not just knocked to the wayside so that they can build their big shed that will create no real employment opportunities for the local area.ldquoIrsquom still confident that the Reporter will find that this isnrsquot the best location of substation at Cockenzie and I can only hope that Scottish Government Ministers will make the best decision for the people of East Lothian which is for rejection of this application, I have my doubts that they will."},{"url":null,"title":"our-community-kitchen-tackling-social-isolation-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen was formed earlier this year as an intergenerational project, which was developed by Dementia Friendly East Lothian.The group was awarded funds from The Big Lottery, with the project, which meets each Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club, on the townrsquos Wemyss Place, now looking to branch out to become its own organisation.Elaine Gale, from the project, said: ldquoOur Community Kitchen has been incredibly popular since beginning at the bowling club in February this year.ldquoWe have been offered a home within the club including full use of kitchen facilities plus a large area for dining.ldquoWe have developed a wonderful relationship with the committee at the club who are supportive and committed to Our Community Kitchen sharing the space with them.The kitchen currently operates each Tuesday from .pm and plans to expand to three or four days each week from January.Donations of homemade bread, napkins and juice have been made to the group, as well as fruit, which has been turned into jam and pies.Haddingtons community council has helped out, with pound, split between plans toserve a Christmas meal and to purchase a new oven at the bowling club.The group has also been supported by Haddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership .Funding was awarded to enable the group to continue into the New Year.Craig McLachlan, the area partnership chairman, said: ldquoHaddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership are focused on addressing inequalities and poverties across our area and these ambitions are being addressed through the work of our area plan.ldquoOne of the main inequalities that we are seeking to address is around social isolation.ldquoOur area has a growing elderly population, where one in five residents is currently aged  and over and, in addition, there are many new houses being built in and around the town so we need to find ways to help these new residents become involved in, and part of, our community.ldquoOur Community Kitchen are doing excellent work to address this, and other inequalities.ldquoHaddington and Lammermuir Area Partnership are therefore delighted to give them our full support."},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-houses-retiring-ceo-mairi-okeefe-praised-by-politicians","story":"Mrs OrsquoKeefe will stand down from the helm of the national respite centre next month, south of North Berwick,  years after she took on the role.And Iain Gray MSP and his Westminster counterpart Martin Whitfield MP have both praised her work.Mr Gray, East Lothianrsquos representative at Holyrood since , told the Courier: ldquoIt has been a great pleasure to work with Mairi at Leuchie House over the last few years.ldquoFrom campaigning to save Leuchie from closure to securing signicant funding to keep it going, she has been the driving force behind the unique facilityrsquos success.ldquoMairi and her team have also helped put North Berwick and East Lothian on the map, with many hundreds of people from across Scotland and beyond remembering it fondly for the warm welcome and superb care and hospitality they enjoy at Leuchie.ldquoI know that Mairirsquos retirement as CEO will not mean the end of her involvement at Leuchie, but she will certainly be a very hard act to follow and I wish her all the very best for the future.And Mr Whitfield praised Mrs OrsquoKeefe for her ldquopassion, knowledge and commitment to Leuchiersquos success.He told the Courier: ldquoWhat she and her team have achieved in establishing Leuchie as a very well thought of independent charity is remarkable and she fully deserves all of the praise and plaudits she has received over the years.

were taken in July and September  by -year-old Elsie Wright and her nine-year-old cousin Frances Grfiths, in the village of Cottingley, near Bingley in Yorkshire.The two girls, like so many children then and now, believed in fairies and set out to prove their existence, little knowing that their practical joke would stir such controversy and fool such eminent figures as Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Borrowing Elsiersquos fatherrsquos Midg quarter-plate camera, and with the use of coloured paper cut-outs and hat pins, they staged their scenes near the stream at the end of Elsiersquos garden.They first showed Frances with four dancing fairies and two months later photographed Elsie seated with a one-foot tall dancing gnome.While Elsiersquos father, a keen amateur photographer who developed the prints, never doubted they were fakes, his we Polly was a believer, and in  she took prints of the two photographs to show members of the Theosophical Society in Bradford, where they were giving a lecture on fairy le.From there things spiralled out of control, first through the enthusiastic belief of leading society member Edward Gardner, who used photography expert Harold Snelling to produce photographic prints of them to be sold at Gardnerrsquos theosophical lectures in .It was during  that Conan Doyle, a committed and leading spiritualist, became aware of the photographs and wanted to use them for an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for The Strand Magazine.Gardner and Doyle sought further expert opinions from the photographic companies, while Gardner met the Wright family and organised a camera and plates for the girls to try to capture more photographs of the fairies.During the summer of  the youngsters managed to ldquocapture three more images of themselves with fairies.Following the publication of Conan Doylersquos article a great public controversy raged with leading scientists and writers voicing their opinions in support of and against the truthfulness of the photographs.The story has rumbled on intermittently ever since, and is considered one of the most bizarre and successful photographic hoaxes of the last century.Auctioneer and photography specialist Chris Albury said the two pictures were sold to UK-based buyers, with the fairy fetching pound, and gnome going for pound,.ldquoWe had so much interest and a bank of about eight phone lines but it was the internet that carried both away without any of the phone bidders getting their hands in the air, he said.ldquoI thoughtthings went wild we

To tell women that the notion of them being the equal of male physicists is the consequence of ldquocultural Marxism and indoctrination is startlingly aggressive. This was no accidental slip off the straight and narrow path of political correctness. Strumiarsquos remarks were incendiary, intentionally so the response of someone at the end of his rope, knowing he would swing for it.Nor, in the ensuing stramashhas he been remotely apologetic. Suspended from Cern, the European Organization for Nuclear Research where he works, the -year-old lecturer from the University of Pisa took his punishment as further evidence of the fundamental problem.It is his contention that the world of physics is becoming sexist against men, and that women are being promoted to positions ahead of better qualied males. Of his suspension he said: ldquoThis is what happens every time somebody wants to speak about this. All these people have been destroyed. Now, it could be that in some places there has been positive discrimination in appointing women. Given their near invisibility in the higher echelons of science for much of the last century, this might have been deemed necessary, not only to show that women were eminently capable of doing the job but also pour encourager les autres.If that is or has ever been the case, it is obviously a far from perfect solution to a historic imbalance. Yet as the importance of gender equality is finally being recognised across all professions and spheres ndash as is the need to eliminate discrimination of any sort ndash there are situations where employers must work harder to ensure eligible candidates are encouraged to apply.If a female applicant for a physicistrsquos vacancy has a less impressive CV than a man, it might be worth taking into account the insidious, age-long institutional or societal prejudices that explain that discrepancy. Rather than perpetuate the vicious cycle by pushing women always to the margins, a few judicious appointments could help adjust the scales.Is this what has motivated Strumiarsquos torrent of disdain  Possibly. He certainly believes men are being sidelined. Yet, since he holds a personal grievance over having once been beaten to a post by a woman, it suggests his rage comes less from rigorous assessment of the employment record in his specialism, and more from pique, a piece of grit that has produced a gallstone, not a pearl. You can picture him since that blow to his pride, nursing his wrath until finally this week it exploded into flame.There are so many disturbing elements to Strumiarsquos outburst itrsquos hard to know where to begin. The fervour with which he spoke is clearly the product of fury, of one who feels under threat. His language is like that of white supremacists who believe black brains are dferent, and thus inherently inferior to white. Or of fascists and sectarians who look down on those of other ethnicities and beliefs as lesser beings.Even more shocking, though, is that this denouncement of his fellow physicists comes at a time when we thought the battle had long since been won. Women and science is one of the oldest zones of conflict in the gender wars. It took centuries for us to be allowed to study medicine, let alone physics, and even then outstanding doctors like Elsie Inglis were sometimes treated by their superiors asthey were hospital porters rather than highly qualied surgeons. Today, the relatively low number of women in top medical roles reinforces the impression that discrimination in this arena persists.That is the most unsettling aspect of Strumiarsquos anger. His comments suggest that acceptance of women in science is far from universal. Despite swt reprisals by Cern, and widespread condemnation among the physics community, his words hint at pockets of resistance and denial. His nasty little speech has revealed the unsavoury truth that attitudes from the days of Galileo are still alive, in a generation that should know better. Bad enough to encounter ignorant or octogenarian sexists. How much worse when those who discredit women are not only bright, but were born into a world where women are wholly emancipated.

A Very English Scandal, however, about the Thorpe affair, was wonderful, a historical tale of political loyalty ndash but so redolent of the fickleness of modern day politics: Trump- Kavanaugh  Salmond-Sturgeon And allegory, thankfully, is back with a vengeance. The Prisoner once tapped into the counter-culture rebellion of the late s. The Fugitive reflected the American issues of freedom and movement, in an existential framework.Now television is repositioning the dark themes of the day. In recent years, Dexter was an allegory for the crime and punishment debate. Right now, cult drama Killing Eve offers a subtext for relationships between women sometimes compelled to be together, yet in competition, one hoping to emulate the other ndash yet just maybe love to have the other offed. A wee hint of Theresa May and Penny Mordaunt, perhaps Meanwhile, big TV hits such as ITVrsquos Strangers and BBCrsquos Keeping Faith ask how we psychologically profile our partner. They question marriage can we really know the person we pledge our troth to  Television is adding great layers.

Yet it still pulled in nearly nine million, its success predicated on the womenrsquos movement ethos ndash a strong, powerful, educated female rails against the abusive louse of a husband when he leaves her for younger gorgeousness. Yet, the same writer Mike Bartlettrsquos BBC drama Press is tight, reflective and and extremely well acted.Thatrsquos not to say some of the allegory we watch doesnrsquot irritate the eyes worse than a rogue midgie when yoursquore out on your bike. Picnic At Hanging Rock was an attempt to symbolise the power of modern female sexuality ndash but was as convincing as a teacherrsquos attempt to argue algebra will one day be useful.Vanity Fair was poor, despite aspirations to present modern-day dilemma in a th century context should I have sex with him even though I donrsquot fancy him, but he drives a Ferrari  At least both were trying to be socially relevant.Now, you may claim that drama can attract decent figures without clever allegorical intent, such as soaps.

From the s, nutritionists, led by Lord Boyd Orr, argued that people should eat more milk, eggs, butter and meat, and cut down on potatoes and bread in the s, they argued that dairy and other fatty foods were the problem, and that people should eat more grains and cereals nowadays, the primary enemies are sugar, salt and bacon.The reality is that studies that purport to show, for example, that bacon causes cancer, and which lead to hysterical headlines, usually have only very minor indicators. But they are seized upon as ldquotargets for action. Whatrsquos more, the evidence is ignoreditrsquos not helpful: the constantly changing drinking guidelines, for example, are based on data that shows that those who have one or two drinksevery day are healthier than non-drinkers. Yet to acknowledge that would undermine the general message that overall alcohol consumption should be lowered ndash even though it is, in historical terms, at one of its lowest levels ever.Evenscientists could agree on the perfect dietthere remains the problem that it works onlypeople follow it. This is where the activists and politicians, crying with Cicero salus populi suprema lex esto , jump in.They take contradictory and half-understood dietary science and impose it with contradictory and half-understood methods for changing peoplersquos behaviour. The quantity of salt and sugar in todayrsquos processed foods, for example, is in part because of the reduction in their fat content which governments previously imposed on manufacturers. Many of such tactics have been useless or counter-productive. The recent change to the recipe for Coco-Pops, for example, was designed to cut down the sugar content, to fight the ldquoobesity epidemic. The new recipe has  per cent less sugar, but is one calorie lower than the old one, which you may not regard as a stunning victory in the war against fat.Anti-smoking activists, ignoring the fact that vaping is the single biggest contributor to the recent reduction in smoking, want it banned, on no scientic evidence. Meanwhile, they remain convinced of the effectiveness of plain packaging, although smoking increased in Australia after the measure was brought in there.The sugary drinks tax isnrsquot doing any better. James Loker, also from TRDP, said that ldquoessentially sugary drinks are doing as well as they always have, and in some cases actually better. The only drinks where sales were down, he concluded, were those, such as Irn Bru and Ribena, that had changed their recipes to include less sugar.On the whole, people know what they should do: eat a balanced diet, take more exercise , donrsquot smoke and donrsquot drink too much. Butthey wonrsquot, the Government is on a hiding to nothing trying to make them. Evenit improved a few peoplersquos health, it would not justy the imposition on everyone ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-glory-of-english-language-in-all-of-its-foibles","story":"I have many very good examples of the use of conjunctions to begin sentences, and paragraphs too, especially in Walter Bagehotrsquos Literary Studies .He frequently begins a sentence with ldquobutas when he writes of the French coup drsquoetat of , and of the previous system of government. ldquoIt was a system of regulated corruption.

This was the international organisation testing the chemicals used in the Salisbury poisoning and which turned out to be Novichok, a nerve agent created in Russia during the Soviet era.But once exposed, the Kremlinrsquos spies were sent packing back to Moscow by Dutch security services, leaving behind them a treasure trove of intelligence about their covert activities.The Dutch operation followed just weeks after the attempted assassination of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March by two fellow GRU officers.In the days and weeks that followed, British officials said Russia spy teams attempted to hack the computers of the Foreign Office and the science laboratory at Porton Down, which was, of course, investigating the deadly nerve agent used in Salisbury.When the GRUrsquos spear-phishing attempts at the headquarters of the OPCW failed, its chiefs ordered Unit  to go to the Netherlands to seethey could have more luck.Yet right from the start they appear to have made little attempt to hide their presence in the country, arriving together with Russian diplomatic passports at Schiphol Airport, where they were captured on CCTV being met by a Russian embassy official.Once through customs and immigration controls, the Russian team hired a car and headed for The Hague. Three days later, on April , the vehicle parked up close to the OPCW building.It was there the Dutch security service - operating with the assistance of British intelligence - pounced.The GRU men were said to have tried to destroy their equipment but were prevented from doing so.In the back of their car, investigators found - partially hidden under a coat - a computer connected to a G mobile and a Wi-Fi  antenna, as well as other specialist hacking equipment together with maps and , euros and , dollars - in cash.Helpfully for the UK and Dutch investigators, taxi receipts were found showing a journey from a GRU facility in Moscow to the airport.There was more.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4810216.1538673811!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour reshuffle i thought richard was better than this","story":"Richard Leonard has axed two of his most prominent frontbenchers in a shadow cabinet reshuffle that has sparked civil war in the Scottish Labour Party.The Scottish Labour leader was last night condemned by fellow Labour politicians for sacking Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie in a reshuffle described by Mr Leonard’s critics as a “victory for factionalism”.window.twttr Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie are seen as centrist members of a Scottish party that has seen a widening split between Mr Leonard’s left-wing allies and the more moderate parliamentarians.The demotion of Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie, who have been regarded as two of Scottish Labour’s best performing frontbenchers, was described as “sad” by Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray. : Scots Labour spin chief quits after six monthsMr Sarwar, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Leonard for the Scottish Labour leadership just over a year ago, was sacked as shadow health secretary.The Glasgow MSP said he was “very disappointed” to lose his job, adding he was dismayed to learn of his fate via Twitter while representing Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber. His imminent departure from Labour’s frontbench was even referred to by SNP health secretary Jeane Freeman in the debate on “women in sport”.: SNP figures pile Scottish independence pressure on Nicola SturgeonMr Sarwar met Mr Leonard to be told of his demotion – a courtesy that was not extended to Ms Baillie, the Dumbarton MSP who left parliament at pm sharp after several hours of speculation over her position.Ms Baillie, who is the only Labour MSP to have represented the same constituency since the birth of devolution in , was sacked over the phone from her job as shadow economy spokeswoman.Mr Leonard’s reshuffle came on the same day Scottish Labour’s head of communications Charlie Mann quit, saying the job was “not for me”.His departure followed several days of infighting over UK Labour’s controversial decision to halt its funding for former Scottish leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal battle against a pro-independence blogger. A majority of Labour MSPs believe the party should fully fund Ms Dugdale’s legal fees after Stuart Campbell, from the Wings Over Scotland ­website, brought a £, defamation case against her. Left-wing allies of Mr Leonard had claimed Ms Dugdale’s supporters were undermining his leadership. Mr Leonard had been criticised for failing to do enough to get the UK party to over-turn its decision. Mr Leonard claimed his new team would “focus on unity and the public, not ourselves and internal battles”.But hopes of uniting the party were dashed as soon as the shadow cabinet was announced. One Labour source described it as a “victory of factionalism over competence”. “It is like taking your two best players off the pitch when you’re three-nil down,” the source said. “This is straight out of the Corbyn playbook.”Mr Murray was angered by the dismissals. On Mr Sarwar’s sacking, Mr Murray said: “The purge of good, capable and committed people goes on merely for standing up for what they believe in. One of our most effective and likeable MSPs. I don’t know whether to be angry or sad. I thought Richard was better than this.”Moving on to Ms Baillie’s departure, Mr Murray said he was “sad, sad, sad” to see her sacked, describing her as “one of the most effective MSPs in Holyrood and very well liked in her constituency”.Mr Sarwar said: “It’s a shame I came to know about this decision through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber. I am incredibly proud of the work I did on behalf of NHS patients and staff, particularly the creation of a workforce commission, the campaign to end the pay cap and the fight to protect local services from SNP cuts. “For the sake of all the people who need a Labour government, I wish Richard Leonard and his shadow cabinet all the very best. I will continue to serve my constituents tirelessly from the backbenches, campaigning for issues close to my heart.”Monica Lennon is taking on the health post for the party. Mr Leonard will combine his leadership with the economy brief. In another controversial move Alex Rowley, Scottish Labour’s former acting leader who was suspended over harassment claims, was reinstated to the shadow cabinet. Mr Rowley, who rejected the claims, was appointed to the local government brief.Ms Baillie said: “I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve and will continue to be a strong advocate for my constituents – and Labour values.

Gary Kelly, from All Under One Banner, said he was meeting HES, the police and council officials today to discuss final arrangements for tomorrow.And he said he hoped HES would agree a rally could take place after all.“I sent them an email suggesting alternatives, like not putting the stage on the grass but putting it on the sidewalk, that way we’re not going to damage the ground in any way.“We have two plans in place – preferably Holyrood Park, that’s Plan A, but we do have a back-up plan just in case they don’t let us do that.”He said Plan B was to erect the stage on the road in Horse Wynd, outside the Scottish Parliament.Meanwhile, Mr Kelly said a plan for up to , people to hold a sit-down protest in Princes Street had been called off.He said: “It was another organisation within the movement doing that but they have removed that event – it’s the sort of bad publicity we don’t really want.”But he revealed another plan to hold a mass photoshoot at the Castle after the pro-independence  Miles group, who are walking  miles around Scotland, were asked to leave Stirling Castle last weekend by HES, who said they were holding an unauthorised demonstration.Mr Kelly said: “We’re encouraging people to go Edinburgh Castle esplanade and get their photo taken at  o’clock before the actual procession starts. Or are they going to try and remove us from there as well ”People attending the march have already announced plans for a “picnic” in Holyrood Park afterwards – and Mr Kelly says they now plan to turn it into a world record bid. “The record is somewhere in Portugal and it was , people, so we’re well in to try to beat that.

Nicola Sturgeon had been expected to update delegates on her plans for a secondindependence vote. But this now appears unlikely with no clear picture on the final Brexit deal which the UK is expected to strike with Brussels.: Nicola Sturgeon ‘uncomfortable’ about Alex Salmond allegations\u2028But Mr Neil made his comments on Alex Salmonds controversial chat show on Kremlin-backed RT.In his introduction, Mr Salmond said the SNP were grappling with “two referenda... whether to support another one on Europe, while promoting another one on Scottish independence.“All of this while support for independence remains at a very high level and, crucially, the activist base, as measured by the turnout at rallies, seems much more mobilised even than in .”Mr Neil said: \"The quicker we get independence the better, becauseyou look at the condition of the Scottish economy and the challenges coming down the road with articial intelligence and all the rest of it,\" Mr Neil said.: Scots Labour spin chief quits after six months\u2028He added: \"Once we know the deal between the UK and the EU, then I think we need to map out very clearly a way forward as quickly as possible towards achieving independence.\u2028\"We need independence as urgently as possible so we can get Scotland back up to the top echelons of economic performance and realise the benefits of our own resources for our own people.\u2028And irrespective of whether youre for or against Brexit I think the one thing were all agreed upon is that Theresa may and her marry band of men and women in the Tory party have shown how not to run a country - not only could we run out own country better than them, we could actually run England better than them.\"\u2028But the comments came under from Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw who said they dont chime with the concerns of ordinary Scots\u2028“Once again we have been shown just how out of touch the SNP is,\" he said.\u2028“The majority of Scots simply want the SNP to improve health, education and fill in the potholes.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say..."},{"url":null,"title":"hilditch remanded after motoring offences ","story":"A drink driver has been remanded in custody after he admitted a number of serious motoring charges.Nathan Hilditch, , of Ulsta, Yell, admitted failing to stop his car on Saturday after being requested by police.He also pleaded guilty to driving dangerously, swerving across both carriageways and repeatedly driving on the wrong side of the road – including when negotiating bends and dips.Hilditch drove at excessive speed, at one point over mph in a mph area.He crashed into an item of road furniture and drove into a ditch.Police later found Hilditch was almost four times the drink driving limit.Appearing in the dock before Honorary Sherf Willie Shannon, Hilditch also admitted driving with  microgrammes of alcohol in his breath.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27470  ","story":" Michael McMonagleAs a former prisoner who is now an elected representative it is important that I visit these imprisoned Catalan elected representatives and raise their cases on the international stage. - Martina Anderson MEPAll Catalan political prisoners held by the Spanish authorities in relation to the Catalan independence referendum should be released immediately. That was the call made by Sinn Féin MEPs Martina Anderson and Lynn Boylan who visited Catalan political prisoners in three jails today as part of a delegation of MEPs from across Europe. The delegation visited nine political prisoners, including former ministers and elected representatives and well as independence activists.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit.  by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1061936.jpg--.jpg?1538468737000\n","title":"menarys is coming to town","story":"MENARYS is to open a new department store in Ballymena Town Centre.The company recently announced the news via social media stating that it was currently recruiting for ious management and sales positions.Menarys Tempest said on its facebook page: “We are sooo excited to announce that we are opening another new store.... this time its in Ballymena.”Menarys has been trading since  growing from one independent store to a chain of  in .

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice. However, it has been delivered through genuine commitment and a willingness to challenge the deep rooted, often unquestioned, attitudes, values and practices which can and do discriminate against some children and families. “It is not about ‘treating all children the same’. Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      UFU welcomes speed limit at local schools Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"A spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.The church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.   The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church.

We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it.

Minister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd “You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”Of the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm.Sad passing of Molly Lutton Shoppers urged to continue to show support for Belfast city centre retailers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this. This is obviously outsourced and we want to bring it back in house again.”Cllr Corr added: “The matter was only raised with me today and we are already working on getting it dealt with.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We are aware of a number of damaged and fallen trees at City Cemetery, caused by Storm Ali. A specialist company is working to clear these but, because of the amount of damage, this is taking some time. However, our contractor is working as quickly as possible and we hope to have all the debris cleared in the near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"donald tusk says eu united behind ireland and to preserving peace process","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Much further-reaching on trade, internal security and foreign policy cooperation. This is a true measure of respect. And this offer remains in place. #brexit— Donald TuskOctober , His intervention comes after Mrs May told the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham that her Chequers plan was the only proposal which would avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Tory Brexiteers – who say Chequers would keep Britain too closely tied to the EU after it has left the bloc – warmly welcomed Mr Tusk’s comments saying they showed another deal was possible.Mr Tusk said: “Let me make this clear: the EU wants a relationship with the UK that is as close and special as possible.“From the very beginning, the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada+++ deal.My press statement on #Brexit after meeting Taoiseach @campaignforleo https:t.co gamWXEFr pic mTuVlHYm— Donald TuskOctober , “Much further-reaching on trade, on internal security and on foreign policy cooperation.

Tusk ERG agree on Canada+++! Prob with Chequers is it asks too much of EU: needs too many concessions ‘cherries’. But EU must concede that Irish border issue is resolvable via checks away from border, not via backstop which threatens to ide UK. @BrexitCentral https:t.co NZwuUzkgW— Bernard JenkinOctober , In his news conference, Mr Tusk also angrily denounced Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s “insulting” comparison in his conference speech of the EU to the Soviet Union.“The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours,” he said.“The European Union is about freedom and human rights, prosperity and peace, le without fear, it is about democracy and pluralism – a continent without internal borders and walls.“As the President of the European Council and someone who spent half his le in the Soviet bloc, I know what I am talking about.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup would reject new brexit proposal says dodds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

And last Monday the airport blamed equipment failure for long delays though its security.Michael Smyth - a union official for Nautlilus International which represents ferry workers - arrived early at the airport for his flight to Liverpool for his organisations annual conference.He is a regular flyer visiting many of the UKs ious ports. He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said.\"I just couldnt understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates on delays and disruption","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Type  diabetes is more common than Type , with around % of all adults with diabetes in the UK having Type .For their study, researchers characterised Type  diabetes as being the rapid onset of insulin dependence within three years of initial diagnosis, together with a severe deficiency of insulin production by the pancreas.They analysed a population cohort of  iniduals who had insulin-treated diabetes that had been diagnosed after the age of .The characteristics of their disease were compared with other participants who still produced some insulin, as well as with  iniduals with severe insulin deficiency that was diagnosed before the age of .The study found that % of those with insulin-treated diabetes who were diagnosed after the age of  had severe insulin deficiency, confirming Type .Out of this group, % did not receive insulin when they were initially diagnosed, with % of those iniduals self-reporting that they had Type  diabetes.A rapid progression to insulin dependence was highly predictive of late-onset Type  diabetes, with % of those with the disease requiring insulin within just one year.Among participants who became insulin-dependent within three years, % developed a severe deficiency of their body’s own insulin.Clinicians should be aware that the majority of patients needing insulin within three years of diagnosis will have Type  diabetes, eventhey were initially thought to have Type  diabetes and did not need insulin at diagnosisDr Nick Thomas, University of ExeterFacebookTwitterTheir clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics were found to be comparable to those of participants who had been diagnosed before the age of .In contrast, patients who retained some insulin production had substantially lower Type  genetic risk scores, antibody positivity , and a higher body mass index .Where insulin treatment had been delayed, the patients were found to be on average older , and only % had self-reported as having Type  diabetes, compared with % of iniduals who had been given insulin upon initial diagnosis.These patients were also much more likelyto have been given oral hypoglycaemic drugs in an attempt to control their disease.The research is being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetesin Berlin.Dr Nick Thomas said: “Type  diabetes leading to severe insulin deficiency has similar clinical and biological characteristics to that occurring at younger ages, but is frequently not identied.“Clinicians should be aware that the majority of patients needing insulin within three years of diagnosis will have Type  diabetes, eventhey were initially thought to have Type  diabetes and did not need insulin at diagnosis.“Getting the right diagnosis is important for these

diagnosis of diabetes is essential as Type  and Type  diabetes have very dferent treatment strategies.“There’s still more we need to understand about the real le implications of misdiagnosis, but this research reminds us once again that people can develop Type  diabetes at any age.“It’s therefore essential that healthcare professionals don’t rule out Type  in adults presenting with diabetes, and

then and now, believed in fairies and set out to prove their existence, little knowing that their practical joke would stir such controversy and fool such eminent figures as Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.Borrowing Elsie’s father’s Midg quarter-plate camera, and with the use of coloured paper cut-outs and hat pins, they staged their scenes near the stream at the end of Elsie’s

public controversy raged with leading scientists and writers voicing their opinions in support of and against the truthfulness of the photographs.The story has rumbled on intermittently ever since, and is considered one of the most bizarre and successful photographic hoaxes of the last century.Auctioneer and photography specialist Chris Albury said the two pictures were sold to UK-based buyers, with the fairy fetching £, and gnome going for £,.“We had so much interest and a bank of about eight phone lines but it was the internet that carried both away without any of the phone bidders getting

Written by academics Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh, the book asserts how the Conservatives tried to woo the Northern Ireland party as part of efforts by the Prime Minister and her allies to prevent Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn from entering Downing Street.Based on interviews with ious sources, the writers insist signicant legwork - which started the day after the Conservatives dismal performance denied Mrs May a majority - had gone into the offer on a full coalition.However, opposition from some of Mrs Mays own MPs to the DUPs positions on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage led to her deciding to withdraw the offer.But chief whip Gavin Williamson is said to have warned the PM that to withdraw the offer would be counterproductive, as negotiations were at a sensitive stage.\"Youve got to show them that youre serious and not to patronise them,\" one Tory source told the authors.The PMs dilemma was effectively resolved when the DUP made it clear that it would in fact prefer the current \"more relaxed\" arrangement, whereby Mrs Foster would ensure her  MPs would back the Government in key votes - such as Budgets and the Queens speech - infor a £bn cash boost for the province. Ironically, the talks took so long that the Queens speech was delayed.Talks had started after Mr Williamson had boarded a plane to Northern Ireland at RAF Northolt the day after the election, still dressed in the suit he had worn at his election count.He met Sir Jeffrey Donaldson at the Stormont Hotel for talks. But the next day they moved to a hotel in Sir Jeffreys Lagan Valley constituency to avoid prying eyes.Before Mr Williamson left for Belfast, the book reveals that \"there had been a long meeting in the Cabinet room to discuss what could be offered to the DUP\".\"The room was hot, there were too many participants and everyone - including the Prime Minister - was exhausted.\"Eventually, it was agreed that the DUP could be offered a confidence-and-supply arrangement, by which they would support the Government on key votes, or a full coalition, in which they would also sit in the Government as ministers.\"After nearly two weeks, the long-awaited deal was finally signed by Sir Jeffrey and Mr Williamson, in front of Mrs May and Mrs Foster. Both No.  and the DUP remained tight-lipped on the claims yesterday."},{"url":null,"title":"andy murray takes to instagram to stick up for double handers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Its a fully al Wii portable inside an actual Altoids tin. It runs hot, has a  minute battery le, and awful controls, but its a real Wii insideIts the worst thing ever. pic WrqiPmVHJB— ShankSeptember , The remarkable creation can play any Wii game and even wirelessly connect Wii remotes should you wish to use one of the console’s motion-sensor-controlled games – but Aden wouldn’t recommend it as a practical outlet for gamers.“What is it like to play it  Awful,” Aden, a business student from Texas, told the Press Association. “The controls are made to be small, not practical.”Nope. Charge for  hours, play for  minutes.— ShankOctober , Lovingly nicknamed the KillMii, the portable device has a short battery le, dficult controls and struggles with overheating, but Aden made it to prove it could be done rather than practical use.Turning games consoles into portables is Aden’s hobby and one he shares with many on online communities.“When I started making portables about four years ago, there was no documentation on the Wii, and I knew nothing about electronics,” said Aden.“I encourage anyone interested to give it a go. It’s expensive, time consuming, and dficult, but you will learn so much along the way.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Many of Aden’s fellow hobbyists helped in the device’s creation, such as Aurelio Mannara, who built the device’s miniature control pad.It’s such a satisfying hobby with a great community,” said Aden. “I’d like to give a thanks to Gman for helping me finish it, as well as Aurelio, ShockSlayer, and the BitBuilt community for all their support along the way.“The Bitbuilt community spent years reverse engineering the Wii in order for us to trim down the motherboard and rewire many of the parts, as well as writing software to allow it to work without some components.“That’s how we were able to get it so small.”Aden posted a video of the KillMii in action on his YouTube channel, which you can watch below.So, next time you go to throw away an empty tin of mints, just remember the potential it holds."},{"url":null,"title":"nobel peace prize winner for 2018 to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

There are also proposals to build on Strangford Loughrsquos tourism potential.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin said the local authority was delighted to have reached a key milestone in the development of the Belfast Region City Deal.ldquoWe have in place an investment proposal that focuses on key investment initiatives within our infrastructure, our tourism, our digital connectivity, the skills and education of our people and innovation and digital capability of our businesses, he said.ldquoAs we move through the next stage of negotiations, we will continue to work closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure that the city deal we secure will deliver on our ambition of a step change in economic performance and more and better jobs for our people.Cllr Murnin said the city deal process had helped to establish what he described as a ldquogenuinely collaborative working relationship across the region and is spearheading a new way of working for councils, the broader public sector, education and business.The local authority and its partners anticipate that an announcement will be made in the forthcoming autumn budget statement, paving the way for them to work up the respective proposals further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ash shortlisted for music prize  ","story":"THE new album from Ash has been shortlisted for this yearrsquos Northern Ireland Music Prize.Islands was released by Downpatrickrsquos Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray in May.The event, which will take place on November  at the Ulster Hall, is now in its sixth year and includes theof three categories that formed part of the very first NI Music Awards back in .Over  industry and media cast their vote for the best album of the last  months.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Police and demonstrators at Duke Street in Londonderrys Waterside on October ,  On that day, a few hundred civil rights protestors demanding electoral, housing and employment reforms assembled at Duke Street in Londonderry’s Waterside. The protestors intended to walk to the Diamond in the city centre, in defiance of a banning order issued by Northern Ireland’s minister of home affairs William Craig.They were met with a baton charge by RUC officers, and the violent clashes were captured by television cameras and broadcast around the world.Further demonstrations and counter demonstrations followed in the weeks and months ahead, and the security situation in Northern Ireland began to slip out of control as the conflict known as the Troubles took hold.Eamonn McCann was a leading member of the Derry Housing Action Committee who had invited the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to Londonderry for the protest.   A young Eamonn McCann addresses crowds in Londonderrys Waterloo Place in the late s “I think the civil rights movement had a huge effect,” he said. “Many of the civil rights demands – for a fair voting system, the abolition of the Special Powers Act, laws against discrimination in jobs, laws to ensure houses were allocated fairly – these things were achieved in short order. They were achieved in the midst of tumult and so forth, but there is no doubt that these advances were achieved by the strategy of the civil rights movement, of people power.”Mr McCann described a planned march by Sinn Fein tomorrow as “another instance of Sinn Fein trying to hijack history”.The veteran campaigner and former People Before Profit MLA said: “I know that many people who were involved in the civil rights movement  years ago are deeply resentful of the fact that these people can come along, after all this time, and parade through the town as the inheritors of the civil rights tradition.“They are no such thing. It is a march of cynicism – cynicism and dishonesty. We’ve had enough distortion of history in Northern Ireland over the years.“The winning of civil rights and equality in the north was not the aim of the long campaign of armed struggle which took over , lives. The Provos fought to get the Brits out of Ireland. That’s just a fact. The idea that the IRA was fighting for equality is just nonsense. “Trying to reshape their history now to pretend that they were just a civil rights party forced to adopt violent means to achieve the demands of the civil rights movement – this is a nonsense.”Mr McCann added: “The truth is not one party’s truth, it is not one person’s truth, and the truth in all its complexity should be told. Bryson ‘corruption’ blog went straight to DUP finance ministerGregory Campbell: Working-class Protestants feared what civil rights movement would become Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“But the one thing we can say absolutely clearly is that Sinn Fein’s claim on the civil rights movement and the civil rights demands is absolutely without foundation.”He also reflected on the failure of the civil rights movement to attract broad support from working-class Protestants and unionists.“On a daily basis, the leaders of unionism were telling their own followers that the civil rights movement was an IRA plot.“That’s absolutely untrue, but the Protestant people were invited by their leaders to believe that to give an inch to the civil rights movement was to compromise their own beliefs.“That was a big factor. But it was also true that people involved in the civil rights movement back then did not give enough thought to a whole series of questions. You have to admit where you got it wrong. One of the things we got wrong is that we didn’t campaign hard enough to disassociate the socialist view from the nationalist view. We should have fought harder to make it more of a matter of class than of community.”Responding to Mr McCann’s comments, a Sinn Féin spokesperson said: “Sinn Féin have organised this march to commemorate the work of the Civil Rights movement and to mark the th anniversary of the th October march in Derry along the original route. “Key to this march is carrying on the march for Civil Rights today. People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fty years ago and we would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us on Saturday at Duke Street.”try catch     .               ..

However, he said that MLAs had been given hints which might have at least prompted questions.   Patsy McGlone at the inquiry The committee’s former chairman, SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone, yesterday defended its work. He was asked about Arlene Foster’s officials describing cost controls “minor administrative amendments”.He said that was “a signicant development that’s being described to us as minor”.David Scoffield QC put it to him: “We haven’t seen any evidence of anyone in the committee picking up the reference to the cost control mechanism ... and realising it was something potentially signicant.” Mr McGlone said: “That’s a fair point, yes.”The MLA said the scheme was consistently “being presented to us in a positive light”. The inquiry’s technical expert, Keith MacLean, said that “even a mild sceptic” might take the view that “it’s easy to get high uptake ratesyou just chuck money at it”.Sir Patrick put it to Mr McGlone that the committee had been told that there were ious risks, adding: “You may well need more information. Why not ask for it ” The MLA said that the department was saying “this is successful”.But Sir Patrick said: “You’re also being given information which – let’s be open about this – I feel should have alerted you to at least asking ‘what do you mean by success here ’ This has got to be value for money. You are the representatives of the public who are responsible for ensuring that the money is properly spent ... did you have sufficient information ... to raise questions ”Pressed again by Sir Patrick, Mr McGlone ultimately accepted that the committee should have asked questions.Gregory Campbell: Working-class Protestants feared what civil rights movement would becomeDubkin urges May to publish plan to break border deadlock Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Timothy Johnston giving evidence to the RHI Inquiry on Thursday Mr Johnston rejected that and told the inquiry that he had no interest in relation to RHI or role in cost controls.But an email which Mr Cairns gave to the inquiry on Wednesday night shows that he was in contact with Mr Johnston about RHI. On August , Mr Cairns emailed him in relation to another renewable energy issue on which they were jointly working, the NIRO electricity subsidy.Mr Cairns went on to say: “We also need to get a catch up on renewable heat. If we are to deviate from GB policy, it will require a ministerial direction [the nuclear option for a minister].”Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said it seemed “a pretty clear suggestion that somebody somewhere was saying ‘don’t put [cost controls] in’.Mr Johnston faced sustained questioning about the topic, with barrister Donal Lunny saying that it “seems to assume a degree of knowledge” about the issue, with the language being “cryptic” to the uninitiated. Mr Johnston said Mr Cairns may have assumed he had more knowledge than he had.When askedhe read the email, Mr Johnston initially said that he “probably skimmed it”. Sir Patrick put it to him that “it’s not a long email ... so skimming it means you probably read it ”Mr Johnston said: “Yes, I thinkyou’re pushing me – I can’t be absolutely % certain.”Sir Patrick asked why Mr Johnston had not instantly phoned or gone down the corridor to ask “what on earth are you telling me about ‘deviation’ for  I haven’t said anything about this. You must have got the wrong person”.Mr Johnston said: “I certainly ... have no sense that I did do that ... I have no sense that at the time I paid a lot of attention to it.”Sir Patrick said the “probable” explanation was that Mr Cairns referred to RHI as he did because there had been an exchange with Mr Johnston on the issue such as the one where he is alleged to have said no to cost controls. Mr Johnston said that he had denied that. But Sir Patrick said: “On this evidence, that [Mr Cairns’ account] fits.”Mr Johnston was asked “had you forgotten about that communication until you saw that email today ” He said: “Yes. Absolutely. And not only that, but I mean it doesn’t massively jog my memory ... I take that email to be ‘Tim, you’ve been away on your holidays, you’ve come back, you’ve a lot of other stuff on we need to talk about RHI’.”Gregory Campbell: Working-class Protestants feared what civil rights movement would becomeDubkin urges May to publish plan to break border deadlock Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dame Una O’Brien said: “But Mr Johnston, it doesn’t actually say that ... If Mr Cairns’s sentence said as you’ve described, I could get that. But it actually doesn’t say that, does it “On any common sense reading, it implies some degree of previous engagement on it – ‘ we are going to deviate’. There’s a gap between what you’re saying it seems to be saying and what it is actually saying.”Mr Johnston said: “I can see that. All I can set out for you is as I both recall it and believe it to be the case that it wasn’t a case that I had ever suggested at any [time] let’s not have tarf controls, or let’s delay them ...”Mr Lunny put it to him that – given that he now accepts he had forgotten about that exchange – there may have been other occasions where RHI was mentioned.Mr Johnston said: “I can’t rule that out. I can’t rule that out. All I can say to you very definitively is that I’m absolutely clear – because it would stick in my memory –I had given the guys to believe, or pushed the notion, or encouraged them down the route of saying ‘there’s not going to be cost controls’ I’m absolutely clear that wasn’t the case.”try catch     .               ..

Irsquom not going to beat around the bush, itrsquos hell on earth.ldquoThe voice in my head has been so unbearably loud I havenrsquot been able to cope with it and when I go to the doctors Irsquom told that Irsquoll be at the top of the waiting list soon. This is where the work of Beat comes in, she said.ldquoI donrsquot want to be the girl that is scared of Tesco Meal Deals, that cries at her thighs or canrsquot go out for meals with friends because itrsquos too anxiety-inducing. I donrsquot want to be so depressed I canrsquot get out of bed and I donrsquot want to feel suicidal and like my le isnrsquot worth living because of my mental health problems.ldquoSo obviously my way of combatting this is jumping out of an aeroplane.An estimated . million people in the UK suffer from an eating disorder, serious mental illnesses that include binge eating disorder, anorexia, bulimia and other types.Beatrsquos Community Fundraising Officer Andrea Auburn said, ldquoGrace is making a huge step in raising awareness and money to help ensure that eating disorder sufferers get support.ldquoGrace is joining dozens of other brave volunteers who are skying to beat eating disorders.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join. There are no auditions and no previous choir experience is needed.The concert saw many people turn up to enjoy the music alongside a iety of refreshments.Dafydd Jones, administrator of the Parish of All Saints Church and organiser of the Music at Lunchtime programme of concerts, said the concert was a great way to start the season.He said: \"An enjoyable time was had by all - audience and performers who have, by the way, expressed a willingness, nay an enthusiasm, to come back for amatch next year.\"After welcoming the audience and thanking them for their attendance, I introduced the Town Mayor, Cllr Jon Luxton who spoke briefly about Music at Lunchtime, the Barry Community Choir and All Saints Church also expressed a desire to come back for other concerts in the future.\"The choir performed a most enjoyable pot-pourri of songs from the shows amongst many others and ended up with a foot-tapping medley of World War One favourites. All in all, a heart-warming programme of music, appreciated by everyone.\"This yearrsquos autumn programme of recitals at All Saints Church continues throughout October and November with an exciting mix of vocal and instrumental soloists and ensembles.All Saints Church is accessible to the disabled and the elderly and also boasts creche facilities.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

misdiagnosed","story":"Scientists at the University of Exeter saidPrime Minister Theresa May is a high-profile example of someone who was initially diagnosed with Type  diabetes, only to laterto her doctors when her treatment did not work and find she had Type .Type  diabetes is characterised by the rapid and severe loss of insulin production due to the cells in the pancreas which produce the hormone being attacked and destroyed by the bodyrsquos own immune system.Iniduals with the disease lose the ability to make their own insulin and therefore require regular doses of insulin to control their blood glucose, either in the form of injections or via a pump, and, unlike many people with Type  diabetes, cannot manage their condition through diet, exercise and blood sugar monitoring alone.Type  diabetes is more common than Type , with around % of all adultswith diabetes in the UK having Type .For their study, researchers characterised Type  diabetes as being the rapid onset of insulin dependence within three years of initial diagnosis, together with a severe deficiency of insulin production by the pancreas.They analysed a population cohort of  iniduals who had insulin-treated diabetes that had been diagnosed after the age of .The characteristics of their disease were compared with other participants who still produced some insulin, as well as with  iniduals with severe insulin deficiency that was diagnosed before the age of .The study found that % of those with insulin-treated diabetes who were diagnosed after the age of  had severe insulin deficiency, confirming Type .Out of this group, % did not receive insulin when they were initially diagnosed, with % of those iniduals self-reporting that they had Type  diabetes.A rapid progression to insulin dependence was highly predictive of late-onset Type  diabetes, with % of those with the disease requiring insulin within just one year.Among participants who became insulin-dependent within three years, % developed a severe deficiency of their bodyrsquos own insulin.Their clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics were found to be comparable to those of participants who had been diagnosed before the age of .In contrast, patients who retained some insulin production had substantially lower Type  genetic risk scores, antibody positivity , and a higher body mass index .Where insulin treatment had been delayed, the patients were found to be on average older , and only % had self-reported as having Type  diabetes, compared with % of iniduals who had been given insulin upon initial diagnosis.These patients were also much more likelyto have been given oral hypoglycaemic drugs in an attempt to control their disease.The research is being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetesin Berlin.Dr Nick Thomas said: ldquoType  diabetes leading to severe insulin deficiency has similar clinical and biological characteristics to that occurring at younger ages, but is frequently not identied.ldquoClinicians should be aware that the majority of patients needing insulin within three years of diagnosis will have Type  diabetes, eventhey were initially thought to have Type  diabetes and did not need insulin at diagnosis.ldquoGetting the right diagnosis is important for these patients to receive the right education and treatment.Lucy Trelfa, of the charity Diabetes UK, said: ldquoDiabetes is a very complex condition, with many dferent types, and as such can sometimes be dficult to diagnose.ldquoGetting the right diagnosis of diabetes is essential as Type  and Type  diabetes have very dferent treatment strategies.ldquoTherersquos still more we need to understand about the real le implications of misdiagnosis, but this research reminds us once again that people can develop Type  diabetes at any age.ldquoItrsquos therefore essential that healthcare professionals donrsquot rule out Type  in adults presenting with diabetes, and consider specialist referral where necessary, to help them make what can often be a tricky diagnosis..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Cases of

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

Alan was a little out, but not by much, writes Justin Rush.  The automation of processes has been one of the hottest discussion topics in . Given that recruitment of staff is a tremendously time intensive process, and one which requires consistency it must surely be a perfect candidate for automation  Well yes… and no. Automation can assist a great deal, but it can’t do everything, not yet anyway.  It is important to know, candidates that are active in today’s employment market are more and more accustomed to using automated chatbots as part of the recruitment process. Non-human involvement equates to zero bias, and therefore reinforces fairness. This is a massive plus point. In a survey by Allegis, % of candidates stated they were comfortable interacting with AI and recruitment chatbots in the early stages of the application process. An even larger proportion - % - were comfortable with chatbots taking care of interview scheduling and preparation.  So what benefits can your business gain from appointing a Recruit-bot Streamlining the applicant journey, by ensuring consistency in the recruitment process and asking screening questions and answering FAQs.Ranking applications, this can be undertaken fairly and quickly based upon candidate submissions. As a result shortlisting is quick and clean.Scheduling assessments and tests, this can be straightforward and without human involvement.   responses, your bot will can exist across your website and all social channels simultaneously.  Your recruitment is now ‘always on’ engaging with potential hires.Repetitive tasks eliminated, creating reports, sending on-line forms or adding candidates to a management system can be a thing of the past.  So automation can really help, especially when volume of applications is a potential issue and you need consistency, or when you are recruiting globally across time zones and don’t want to miss out on a potential inquiry.  Some issues do still remain, despite the efforts of articial intelligence to do it all. In the main, these are the human factors, for example, the assessment of certain competencies that are essential for a job such as team-working.   At present, bots aren’t quite ready to handle the intricate aspects of the recruitment process that require patience and finesse. Answering more specic questions that more specialist professionals may want to ask about a job opportunity, selling the career opportunity or negotiation of salary and terms. These aspects are not part of any readily available algorithm… yet.
