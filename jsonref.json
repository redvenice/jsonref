If a person gives up their former nationality it may suggest a change of domicile.\u0027Status is not given automatically because an inidual must apply for the exemption in their tax status when filling out their UK tax return.According to the Government, a person\u0027s domicile is usually the country where their father considered his permanent home when the inidual was born.Others can also inherit their domicile from their parents, meaning they can still be born in the UK but have non-dom status.When evaluating someone\u0027s domicile, the taxman will consider a number of factors, including permanent country of residence and how long an inidual intends to stay in the UK.When it comes to tax, the rules state that you do not pay UK tax on foreign income or gains if they are less than £2,000 a year and you do not bring them into the UK.If you earn more than £2,000 from overseas or bring any money into the UK you must pay UK tax on it - although this may be claimed back.Or you can pay an annual charge, depending on how long you have been in the UK.The charges are £30,000 if you have been in the UK for at least seven of the last nine tax years, or £60,000 for at least 12 of the previous 14 tax years.Therefore, if you are resident in the UK but a citizen of another country, you must still pay a fee.For high net-worth iniduals, many will opt for the yearly charge because the income received from foreign businesses and investments is likely to lead to a far higher tax bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1c3039b2626447b3c832b9f0cc0e15ebff39ac/0_102_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9143f7806891ab0b45f22d76b3e485f7","title":"norwich v burnley premier league live","story":"“God speaks,” says Mary Waltz. “I will claim ine intervention on that Cornet miss.”“Take it from this Norwich fan and veteran of many village discos Tim,” says Rod Wooden, “Gilmour’s absence from our line up is a real positive. I have no idea why Smith keeps playing him. He’s very lightweight and I can’t see him getting into the team once he goes back to Chesea. Strange thing is, he seems to play well for Scotland, but for us he’s a dead loss.”We’ve had 16 shots (10-6 to Burnley), nine corners (5-4 to Burnley), no clear-cut chances and one goal (1-0 to Norwich). Time for a cup of tea.“Speaking of kits and designs,” says Ezra Finkelstein, “I wonder what you think is the best effort in the Premier League this year? In my humble opinion Crystal Palace have a lovely shirt.” Personally I like it when the designers get away from the colour scheme of the soft-play area, while still showing some awareness of the club’s traditions. The slate is never blank.“Rooting for the Canaries,” says Joe Pearson, our person in Indianapolis. “And not just because I put money on Burnley getting relegated all the way back in August. OK, maybe that is the reason.”I wasn’t saying 538 were wrong! Just thought it was interesting.A pretty wise group: that’s how Dyche does it.Burnley badly need three points to keep up with Everton, who sprang a surprise by actually winning a game yesterday. Norwich need three points even more than that: they’re going down unless they go on a glorious run right now, and although they have a winnable game next week – against Ralf Rangnick’s Also-Rans – that one is away, while this is at home. Both these clubs have spent the past eight months collecting just four league wins. The difference between them is all in the draws: six to Norwich so far, 12 to Burnley. Dean Smith could reasonably claim that his side play the better football, but Sean Dyche has the edge on experience and pragmatism. The other night, against Everton, the football was suddenly decent too, with Maxwel Cornet finding his silver hammer. It could be a cracker.

A low turnout is widely believed to be bad news for the far-right leader, because it could be a sign that her supporters, who often fail to show up on voting day in the kind of numbers that the polls predicted, may again be staying away.  On the other hand, some of the detail in those midday turnout figures could be ringing a few alarm bells in the president’s camp: abstention looks to be higher in the Paris region, which was heavily pro-Macron in the last elections in 2017, whereas turnout in some areas that voted predminantly for Le Pen five years ago seems to be significantly higher. The next turnout figures are expected at 5pm local time, so we may get a clearer idea then. But there will be no certainty about what it all means until the first projections when polls close at 8pm - these are not, by the way, exit polls, but estimations based on actual votes cast in a representative selection of polling stations nationwide. They are usually very accurate. It looks like being a nail-bitingly close-run thing, with opinion polls showing the gap between Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) and the outgoing president, centrist Emmanuel Macron, steadily narrowing over the past few weeks. Those two candidates remain favourites to advance to the 24 April run-off that will determine who occupies the Elysée palace for the next five years, although support for the radical left-winger Jean-Luc Mélenchon has also been climbing and the level of abstention could play havoc with all pre-election forecasts. It’s been a strange, muted campaign that in many ways never really got off the ground, hijacked first by the pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine. But its consequences could well prove far-reaching, not just for the future direction of France but for Europe as a whole. We’ll be bringing you news, comment and analysis from me, the ’s Paris bureau chief Angelique Chrisafis and correspondent Kim Willsher, with usually accurate projections of the first round results expected when polling stations close at 8pm local time.

Britain’s gardens.Sales of home-grown rose plants are estimated to have declined from 65 million a year in the 1960s to just five million last year as young people consider the bloom to be “old-fashioned and twee”.Now, in a desperate bid to revive the rose, a new campaign has been launched to convince the new generation of lockdown gardeners that the flower does not require months of toil but can actually create “instant gardens”.Experts are also eager to debunk the myth that roses need intensive pruning and constant spraying to keep pests at bay.The campaign, which is being championed by TV\u0027s David Domoney, will use the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show in May for a formal “call to arms” for consumers, growers and breeders to champion the beleaguered rose.The message will be that modern hybrids are easy to grow, resistant to diseases like black spot and mildew, do not require harmful fungicide sprays and can be planted in hedging, borders, beds, on patios, balconies, as climbers or in a vegetable plot.And while bright reds and pinks have been traditional favourite colours, nowadays glorious apricots, yellows and golds are increasingly popular.Mr Domoney, from ITV’s Love Your Weekend, said: “I’m passionate about roses and there has been a massive love of roses in Britain throughout our history, but roses are vanishing from our public parks and gardens and people are taking roses for granted.“Young people see them as old-fashioned and rather twee and what their grandparents grew.“So it’s time we stood up for the rose and appreciate its versatility - its beauty, use in perfumes, health treatments and even in food.”A social media campaign will showcase roses in all forms and spaces with Mr Domoney offering growing tips.Video footage will also show how he transforms a 20mx20m plot at his home to create a traditional Regency style tea garden with a fountain, parterre and pergola.Some 5,000 rose plants have already been sent out to community gardens across the country and images are also to be posted as part of the campaign. The plan is to give away a further 100,000 over the next 10 years.Among the rose varieties being featured in the campaign are the Chandos Beauty, Lady Marmalade, Sweet Syrie, Easy Does It and Raspberry Royale.David White, the managing director of Harkness Roses which is also supporting the campaign, said: “When I was a boy, roses were seen in public parks and gardens everywhere, but over the years their reputation has gone down as people think they are too difficult to grow and you have to go on a three-day pruning course to look after them.“But the new varieties are so easy to grow. Young gardeners don’t want to spend months tending their garden, they just want an instant garden that can be an outdoor room to their home and roses are ideal and great value. A typical plant costs £15 that will give 100 flowers a year for 15 years which works out at 1p a flower.“We want to galvanise all growers and breeders to revive the rose.”Chris Warner, of Warner’s Roses and Rose Society, added: “For too long roses have been perceived as a problem and this campaign is just what we need to inform people that roses have changed.“Old varieties requiring fungicide sprays gave roses a bad name. Now we need to show off our roses in railway stations, airports, everywhere so people can see the beauty, colour, drama and impact of roses.”More from NewsWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Thieves posing as government officials dismantle 60ft bridge in \u0026#39brazen\u0026#39 heistRussia-Ukraine latest news: Rocket attack destroys major airport in DniproGermany ‘refused’ arms’ company’s offer to refurbish tanks to send to UkraineAre Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s policies enough to overcome his far-Right rival?French election 2022 poll tracker: Race to become France\u0026#39s next president tightensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive full scale nato military force defend borders","story":"Nato is drawing up plans to deploy a full-scale military force on its border in an effort to combat future Russian aggression following the invasion of Ukraine, the alliance’s secretary general has revealed.In an interview with The ­, Jens Stoltenberg said Nato was “in the midst of a very fundamental transformation” that will reflect “the long-term consequences” of Vladimir Putin’s actions.As part of a major “reset”, the relatively small “tripwire” presence on the alliance’s eastern flank will be replaced with sufficient forces to repel an attempted invasion of member states such as Estonia and Latvia. Options for the reset are being developed by Nato military commanders.The disclosure came as Boris Johnson made an unexpected visit to Kyiv to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. The Prime Minister used the visit, which was planned in secrecy, to announce that Britain was sending anti-ship missiles and 120 armoured vehicles in the latest batch of military assistance.On Saturday night, Mr Johnson said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.”In a joint television appearance with Mr Zelensky, he added: “I think that the Ukrainians have shown the courage of a lion, and you Volodymyr have given the roar of that lion. “Having been here in Kyiv for just a few hours, I have no doubt at all that an independent sovereign Ukraine will rise again thanks above all to the heroism, the courage of the people of Ukraine.”Only half a dozen Downing Street staff are understood to have known about Mr Johnson’s visit before the Ukrainian embassy tweeted a picture of the Prime Minister holding talks with Mr Zelensky – such was the level of secrecy adopted for security reasons.Mr Stoltenberg urged other countries to emulate Britain’s support for Ukraine, as he signalled agreement with Mr Zelensky’s view that nations such as Germany were making a false distinction between “defensive” weapons they were willing to supply to Kyiv, and “offensive” weapons that they see as a red line.He also revealed that the threat from China would be enshrined into Nato’s “strategic concept”, its formal strategy document, for the first time, as Beijing and Moscow appeared to be “working more and more closely together”.Amid pressure by some Conservative MPs and ministers for increased defence spending in the UK, Mr Stoltenberg said that he would “welcome” more military expenditure from Britain. But his focus was on ensuring other Nato allies met the alliance’s minimum requirement of 2 per cent expenditure as a share of their GDP.Setting out plans for the “reset” of Nato, Mr Stoltenberg pointed out that it now already had 40,000 troops under its direct command in the eastern part of the alliance – nearly 10 times the number it had a few months before the invasion. But he added: “What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a longer-term adaptation of Nato. I expect that Nato leaders will make decisions on this when they meet in Madrid at the Nato summit in June.”Before Feb 24, Nato’s presence on its eastern border with Russia amounted to a so-called “tripwire” force, which was intended to signal the alliance’s intent to defend itself from an attack.In the event of an attack on countries such as Latvia and Estonia, which border Russia, reinforcements would have been called in from across the alliance. But now Nato is preparing to have a presence on its eastern flank of a scale that could itself defend the alliance against a Russian attack. Last month Britain said it would double its troops in Eastern Europe and send a new deployment to Bulgaria, when Nato leaders agreed to further strengthen the alliance’s eastern flank against Russian aggression. But Mr Stoltenberg’s remarks reveal that the alliance is preparing to go further still.Appearing to reject the claim by some countries that “offensive” weapons should not be provided to Ukraine for fear of provoking Russia, Mr Stoltenberg said: “Everything Ukraine does with different types of weapons is defensive, it is about defending themselves against the atrocities, against the invasion, against a brutal use of military force against their own country.”As well as the additional military ­support for Ukraine, Mr Johnson said the UK would guarantee an additional $500 million (£385 million) in World Bank lending to the country, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee to $1 billion.More from NewsWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Thieves posing as government officials dismantle 60ft bridge in \u0026#39brazen\u0026#39 heistRussia-Ukraine latest news: Rocket attack destroys major airport in DniproGermany ‘refused’ arms’ company’s offer to refurbish tanks to send to UkraineAre Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s policies enough to overcome his far-Right rival?French election 2022 poll tracker: Race to become France\u0026#39s next president tightensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"foreign countries should adopt british rules keep children safe","story":"Children will only be safe in a borderless digital world if other countries adopt the UK\u0027s children\u0027s code, the information watchdog has warned.John Edwards, the information commissioner, will use a global summit this week to urge international watchdogs and social media firms to adopt the code as a worldwide model for regulation.Setting out his vision exclusively in The  ahead of the summit, Mr Edwards said it was only through other countries toughening their laws that British children would be protected when they used online services based outside the UK.The code would place a legal duty of care on companies in whatever jurisdiction they operate to protect children online with default settings and safety measures designed to guarantee privacy.Firms failing to comply with the code would face heavy fines and blocks on their services. It would be modelled on internationally agreed data protection laws where financial penalties are generally set at four per cent of global turnover, equivalent to more than £3 billion for a firm such as Facebook.Mr Edwards said California, which hosts the HQs of some of the biggest tech firms in the world, was already introducing a UK-style children’s code, with the bill\u0027s first reading in the state’s assembly on April 19. The Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Canada and Australia are bringing in similar measures.“We’re calling for our code to be used as a worldwide model for regulation,” said Mr Edwards, who will set out his proposals at the International Association of Privacy Professionals summit in Washington.“We knew from the moment we started drafting our code that its value in keeping children safe would depend on how the code was received internationally.“The digital world is borderless, and so many of the online services children access are based outside of the UK. The more other countries require companies to protect children’s data, the more children in the UK are protected.“And the UK has an opportunity to influence real change based on the world-leading code we developed. We’ve seen rapid changes in how UK children are protected online following the expectations set in our code.“Targeted and personalised ads are being blocked for children children’s accounts set to private by default, plus location history turned off by default.

All political parties now, quite rightly, champion equality. But as far back as 1882 Gladstone’s second administration passed the Married Women’s Property Act, undoing centuries of English common law and a husband controlling the assets of his wife. Now, 140 years later, so-called progressives are attacking the Chancellor for not playing the mid-Victorian paterfamilias, and keeping his wife’s finances under control.The absurdity of attacking Mr Sunak for how his wife, who is not even a British subject, manages her considerable wealth only emphasises the cowardice and stupidity of using her to undermine him: for it should be obvious that he had dug his own political grave quite deeply enough without his enemies weaponising her.Much is awry not just with British economic management, but with the presentation of economic policy, and the buck stops with him. He has helped other parties to challenge the Conservatives’ economic record. More pointedly, he has made it easy for those of his colleagues who wish to stop him from succeeding Boris Johnson to do so. It is seldom wise, if one has prime ministerial ambitions, to be the heir apparent, as any number of beached ex-cabinet ministers will confirm. Mr Sunak, sadly for him, has become the latest.It is not advisable to be Second Lord of the Treasury in an avowedly tax-cutting party at a time when the tax burden is at its highest since the days of Mr Attlee, when we had the Second World War to pay for. It is not good to preside over apparently uncontrollable public spending – pandemic or not – to the point where your colleague, the fraud minister, resigns because you are showing no inclination to tackle £4.3 billion of fraud against the Exchequer caused by Covid loan schemes: never mind £9 billion written off for useless personal protective equipment.But perhaps worst of all – and this seems to have become the main card to be played against the Chancellor – it appears not to be a good idea to be a very rich man with an even richer wife at a time when, it is reported, some people are feeling forced to choose between eating and turning their heating on, and you have just made many of them pay more National Insurance.Being extremely rich should not be a disqualification from holding high political office. However, the Chancellor’s public relations of late have been abominable, especially for one who was formerly so assiduous (perhaps too assiduous) at projecting an attractive public image. If he understands what life is really like for many whom he helps govern then he makes a poor show of communicating that fact. Notably, a photo opportunity he staged when cutting fuel duty last month served to suggest only his inexperience at filling a car up, leaving others to assume that he has a forelock-tugging man who does that for him.Mrs Sunak’s agreement to pay tax on her overseas earnings in Britain has been reported as a ploy to save her husband’s career. It is probably too late. The Prime Minister, having seen the failure of many ministerial colleagues and backbenchers to support Mr Sunak, may conclude that he could reshuffle him without much harm. With all the talk of the Sunaks’ global property portfolio, and of Mrs Sunak being richer than the Queen, Tory MPs are now openly saying he is too rich to be prime minister. Given what Labour calls “the cost of living crisis” and Mr Sunak’s tactlessness in managing his public image and his policies, they may, regrettably, be right.In a meritocratic party a leader should be chosen according to his or her abilities. Unfortunately for Mr Sunak, however, what has really undone him is that his talents are now being seriously called into question. His family’s fortune, compared with that failing, is a secondary matter.More from NewsLondon local elections 2022: When are they, why is this year significant and how to vote?Local Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to voteRussia-Ukraine latest news: Rocket attack destroys major airport in DniproWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Thieves posing as government officials dismantle 60ft bridge in \u0026#39brazen\u0026#39 heistGermany ‘refused’ arms’ company’s offer to refurbish tanks to send to UkraineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stuck macron le pen frances political system disintegrating","story":"Whatever the outcome of France’s presidential vote – and President Macron will probably be reelected – I fear it marks another stage in the dissolution of a political system. Of course, this could be beneficial: we are supposed to welcome change and renewal. It will certainly be interesting: France has often been a political laboratory for Europe, and its people are quite proud of this. But life in a laboratory is not comfortable.The familiar political landmarks that democratic systems depend on have gone. It is astonishing that the candidates of what were until recently modern France’s two ruling parties, the Socialists and (under a variety of names) the Gaullists, have been reduced to insignificance, with their presidential candidates polling at under 10 per cent. Yet France’s previous president was a Socialist, François Hollande, and the Gaullist François Fillon would probably have beaten Macron in 2017 had he not been caught up in a corruption scandal. Now these political pillars of the Fifth Republic system, parties that provided essential popular representation, have almost completely disintegrated. This election could be their coup de grace.Now France is faced solely with alternatives that repel or alarm a large part of its people: Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. Even at the last election, Macron was the first choice of only a quarter of the electorate. Then he seemed an unobjectionable centrist. Now he is regarded with visceral dislike by a remarkable range of people. Le Pen represents a far-Right tradition that until recently most voters considered beyond the pale: reactionary, racist, and undemocratic. But it has increased its appeal, especially among the young.Whoever becomes the next president will face a discontented and alienated country, and it is unclear how effective government can be possible. A President Le Pen would mean violence in the streets and political and economic crisis. Would she be capable of forming a credible government? Many of those voting for her are so discontented that they are willing to risk pulling the house down. But if he is re-elected Macron might also be faced with popular rebellion, and with a slim prospect of a parliamentary majority to support him.France’s predicament is an extreme form of the political malady rife across the democratic world: rejection of conventional politics, reduced party loyalty and membership, low turnout in elections, unpredictable and volatile voting choices. This has given politicians standing in opposition to “mainstream politics” – or claiming that they were – an opportunity in several countries.They are conventionally dismissed as “populists”. Le Pen of course is one of these. So is her far-Left equivalent, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But Macron himself was the arch-populist, campaigning in 2017 against conventional politics, rejecting existing parties and creating his own movement drawn from civil society bodies and non-politicians. This respectable bourgeois populism has a label: “technopopulism”. It claims legitimacy from a superior ability to manage the system, in Macron’s case as would-be leader of a more powerful technocratic EU. His victory sounded the death knell of the old party system.Does this matter? Yes, if nothing replaces it which can perform the minimum functions of democratic parties: to assemble majorities, or at least large coherent minorities, to bring forward (and get rid of) political leaders, to formulate programmes and try to carry them out if elected, to give people a means of participating and being represented, and to maintain a sense of legitimacy. No system does this perfectly indeed, looking round the world we can see how poorly many democracies are working, including the most established. But in a system stuck between Macron and Le Pen, the problem is acute.Does history explain this? Clearly yes. Political systems are invariably created in times of crisis, and are very difficult to change thereafter. France’s present 1958 constitution, which its drafter aptly called a “republican monarchy”, was adopted to enable Charles de Gaulle to master the incipient civil war over Algeria, and to establish a powerful and even authoritarian government as the Fifth Republic.This was the latest variant of the regular fluctuations between authority and democracy that France has experienced since the 1789 revolution. The most recent had been the ultra-reactionary Vichy regime of Marshal Pétain (1940-44), followed by the ultra-parliamentary system of the Fourth Republic (1946-58), criticised as impotent and chaotic. De Gaulle’s system has been plausibly called Bonapartist, which is an attempt to combine both authority and democracy – “active authority, passive democracy”, as one historian has defined it.The Fifth Republic is paradoxical. It has been the most widely accepted and arguably the most successful of the 15 constitutional systems France has had since 1789. Yet it has always been criticised in principle, and has regularly given rise to problems. A cynic might say that it is principles that are France’s problem. Unlike Britain – which, said Disraeli, was not governed by principles but by parliament – the French have regularly chosen, or been forced, to try to design perfect systems. This, Edmund Burke thought, was the original sin of the Revolution, the “fairy land of philosophy”. De Gaulle’s republic deliberately weakened political parties and parliament by concentrating power in the presidency.After 64 years it has succeeded rather too well. Parties are largely the supporters’ clubs of iniduals, based on patronage and personal ties. Le Pen’s party, now called the Rassemblement National, is a 50-year-old family business. Macron started his own from scratch – La République en Marche (now simply EM! complete with exclamation mark). But then de Gaulle, the godfather of the system, also had his own tame party.The overriding aim of the party is to install a president, who is practically irremovable, and whose powers of government and patronage are immense. As a sceptical commentator, Jean-François Revel, wrote some years ago, this was an instrument so open to abuse that it was “criminal to put it even into the hands of a saint”. It was absolutism”, but “ineffective absolutism”. And indeed Macron’s high-handed plans for sweeping reform had to be watered down or dropped after the gilets jaunes revolted and workers came out on strike. But Macron remained. And is likely to remain for another term. To do what?The last two parties standing will be Macron’s EM! and Le Pen’s RN. Their changing and abbreviated titles show how little they exist apart from their leaders. The great mass parties that once bestrode French political life have almost vanished. Yet they possessed not only vast organisations, but whole cultures: there was a “peuple de gauche” with its own sociability, rituals and even tastes (the Left, one survey showed, preferred Camembert).But it is the far Right that is still alive and kicking. It too has its historic cultural core: a mixture of traditional Catholic patriotism, once royalist of French nationalism, resistant to Macron’s flamboyant Europeanism and of suspicion of immigrants. This attracted many former Communists, and now many young voters, embittered by poor job prospects and a system that seems unheeding.It is precisely this Right-wing tradition – long embodied by Jean-Marie Le Pen and tainted by anti-Semitism, anti-republicanism, Algérie Française nostalgia, and a lingering association with Pétainism – which made Le Pen father and daughter unelectable. Most French citizens, whether Socialist or Gaullist, would under no circumstances vote “lepeniste”.This political conundrum – a hard-core tradition that kept lepenism going despite all the reverses, but which at the same time made it unelectable – may be unravelling as the historical burden of the 1940s and 1950s is shrugged off by new generations. I still think that the weight of history means that Le Pen will be beaten even by Macron. But no longer by a landslide.  Then there is likely to be some sort of political turmoil that may bring new alliances and perhaps more ephemeral parties into existence. But the wish expressed by generations of French politicians since the early 19th century that France might develop a stable system of respectable moderate parties like the American and the British that could offer credible alternatives seems less than ever likely, not least because the Anglo-Saxon model is now uninspiring.So whoever becomes the next President, the likelihood is of a remote and unpopular incumbent, unable to unite the country, unable to carry out a programme, but solidly ensconced in the Elysée Palace. Whether Macron or Le Pen, the dangerous instrument will not be in the hands of a saint.  Robert Tombs is professor emeritus of French history at the University of CambridgeMore from NewsWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Thieves posing as government officials dismantle 60ft bridge in \u0026#39brazen\u0026#39 heistRussia-Ukraine latest news: Rocket attack destroys major airport in DniproGermany ‘refused’ arms’ company’s offer to refurbish tanks to send to UkraineAre Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s policies enough to overcome his far-Right rival?French election 2022 poll tracker: Race to become France\u0026#39s next president tightensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"xi jinping dare not climb zero covid tiger","story":"Since late January 2020, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) finally admitted that the Covid-19 outbreak had become an epidemic and locked Wuhan down, it has bombarded the world with claims about the success of its draconian containment policy known as Zero Covid. These claims have been widely accepted at face value. Not only People’s Republic of China (PRC) officials but bien-pensant Western commentators decry demands for hard data about the origins of the virus and the realities behind the CCP’s response. The experiences of Chinese citizens have remained largely unheard.This wall of silence is beginning to crumble. For more than a month the PRC has been hit by wave after wave of omicron outbreaks. It is clear that Zero Covid cannot keep more transmissible strains of the virus under control. Public opinion in the widening areas of China once more in the grip of a brutal lockdown has turned against Zero Covid – most notably in Shanghai, where 26 million people are now subject to a grimmer lockdown regime than Wuhan endured two years ago.Xi Jinping continues to force hard lockdowns onto increasingly desperate Chinese citizens in the apparent belief that the health benefits will outweigh the serious economic and social risks. But is this questionable judgment the real reason for his unwillingness to take a different path? It’s worth revisiting the background to Xi’s identification with Zero Covid from its inception.Xi kept a low profile in the early days of Covid-19. But a CCP journal later quoted him describing an extraordinary meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee he summoned on 7 January 2020 at which he gave instructions on how to deal with the outbreak. But nothing was done to stop the virus spreading until a fortnight later, by which time millions of Spring Festival travellers had passed into or out of Wuhan, the centre of an epidemic which then spread across the world.Yet the CCP claims the 23 January lockdown largely confined Covid within Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei Province. Subsequent outbreaks have mainly been blamed on returning visitors infected overseas. China’s official Covid deathtoll now stands at 4,638. Around 95 per cent of this strangely low number of deaths reportedly took place in locked-down Wuhan and Hubei in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown. This questionable assertion underlies CCP claims that Zero Covid “succeeded”.Two years on, key engines of the PRC economy are grinding to a halt as cities and regions which generate a quarter of China’s GDP go into lockdown. Maintaining growth is crucial for the otherwise unaccountable regime to maintain social order, but prospects look bleak for the economy meeting even this year’s modest targets. In urban centres, dystopian repression imposed on millions of hungry and frightened middle class citizens is becoming intolerable. Less is known of conditions in more remote regions, but repressive zeal there tends to be manifested more brutally still.Xi hopes to extend his tenure as supreme leader of the CCP at its 20th Party Congress later this year. His explicit backing for Zero Covid seems to be influenced by his interest in claiming victory over the virus to support his ambitions at home and his struggle with democratic critics abroad. Those who seek to share in his dictatorship will not venture to derail Zero Covid now. Nor will Xi tolerate any exposure of its flaws.Xi seeks to outdo Mao as an undisputed Chinese dictator as in Mao’s case the greatest risks, if he succeeds, will be to the Chinese people. So far, he seems indifferent to their plight, and that for the present the Roman tag apparently fits: “Let them hate, as long as they fear”. But a Chinese proverb bears repeating too “if you ride a tiger, it’s hard to dismount”. Zero Covid is the tiger that Xi dares not climb off.More from NewsWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Thieves posing as government officials dismantle 60ft bridge in \u0026#39brazen\u0026#39 heistRussia-Ukraine latest news: Rocket attack destroys major airport in DniproGermany ‘refused’ arms’ company’s offer to refurbish tanks to send to UkraineAre Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s policies enough to overcome his far-Right rival?French election 2022 poll tracker: Race to become France\u0026#39s next president tightensMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner tories blame frightening","story":"Tories are to blame for frightening cost of living crisis, not RussiaAngela Rayner, Labour deputy leader, has criticised the Governments decision to hike National Insurance at a time when families are already under strainRenewable energy sources are more self-reliant - but have been too neglected by the Tories, says Angela Rayner Image: Martin Burton SussexLiveopinionByAngela Rayner:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsThe Government’s introduction of a National Insurance hike at a time when families are already struggling to make ends meet is genuinely frightening. We are facing an extraordinary rise in the cost of food and fuel, which is affecting just about everybody – not just people who are on low incomes. To see this steep surge in prices has been devastating... and it’s only going to get worse. We have said time and time again that it is absolutely not the right time to be increasing National Insurance. And it goes directly against promises the Tories made to voters. They are trying to link the energy crisis to the war in Ukraine. But they knew the supply of oil and gas was a problem before. They have tried to blame the National Insurance hike on Covid. But  years of Tory austerity has made things even worse for the health and social care sector and put huge pressure on hospitals and the NHS.  The Tories have created this crisis and to break their promises when they knew this was coming just shows we cannot trust a word they say. They are so out of touch, they don’t even realise that this is the biggest cost-of-living crisis in generations. All the while, we learn that Rishi Sunak’s we uses a loophole scheme to avoid UK tax. I have had so many people contacting me who are absolutely petried that they are not going to be able to afford to live over the next few months. I grew up in poverty and saw the devastating effects this can have first-hand. The shocking thing now compared to when I was growing up, however, is that these are often people in decent jobs who are being forced to go to food banks in order to support themselves. So many of these people suffering, such as nurses and care workers, were told they were lockdown heroes  months ago. Now they feel like they’re being punished and are completely demoralised.  What’s particularly frustrating for me is that the North and the Midlands were promised so-called “levelling up”. But these are the places that are going to be the hardest hit by the crisis. People in constituencies like mine in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester were promised their bills would go downwe left the European Union – but the opposite has happened. Labour would impose a windfall tax on gas and energy companies. We have done this in the past and we can do it again. There is no reason why we cannot pass this money on to the people who need it the most to ease the cost of living squeeze. This would reduce the average household energy bill by up to £, and we would target support to low earners, pensioners and squeezed families. We also need to ensure a more secure workforce, with a decent living wage and proper employment rights.  The PO scandal has shown us that anyone is vulnerablewe let this stand – and this Government cannot be trusted to step in and stand up for workers. We would also invest in renewable energy, like wind farms, to make us more self-reliant and more secure as a country. It would also bring in skilled workers to areas such as the North and Scotland, where people can get decent jobs to last them a letime. The Government’s response has been woeful and last week’s tax hike is only going to plunge more people into more devastation and debt.

On the international stage, Mr Johnson has shown Britain to be Ukraine’s staunchest ally, committed to Ukrainian independence and standing by the Ukrainian people in their hour of need. But that story is disturbingly dferent closer to home. What Ukrainian people fleeing war need most is sanctuary, and , big-hearted British families are ready to open their homes to provide it. Yet only , Ukrainian refugees have arrived here so far under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  That is because Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enough. The Home Secretary promised Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko she would ensure visas were processed in three days. That was three weeks ago. Ms Vasylenko is an impressive MP. And she is not impressed by Ms Patel’s dilly-dallying. In Kyiv today, Mr Johnson showed President Zelensky the firm hand of friendship. Now the PM needs to take a firm hand with Ms Patel – and tell her thatshe cannot sort out this mess, he will find someone who can.  Grant us a plan There was something depressingly inevitable about Brits who’d been looking forward to their first proper holiday for years spending much of it stuck in traffic jams and airport lounges. Today, chaos reigned on the ground and in the air as people tried to get away for a much-needed Easter break. The port of Dover blamed its delays on the suspension of PO Ferries. Airports said they were plagued by Covid staff absences. And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrung his hands and expressed concern, which was about as much use as a flat tyre on the M. PO bosses are to blame for some of this by their summary sacking of  seafarers. We must spare a thought for them and their families. But Mr Shapps knew PO would present a problem this weekend. And Covid should have come as no surprise to him. Labour says better planning could have alleviated some of these delays. And when it comes to travel, Mr Shapps is planner-in-chief.

And he got the snap he wanted. A handshake and grin before getting back on the plane. Job done. Kind of. After all, that’s the optics sorted, PM, now it’s time for action. During his brief stay Mr Johnson pledged, as is his wont, everything that Ukraine needs to survive as a sovereign nation. And he’s promised missiles, rockets, armoured vehicles and new anti-ship weapons systems. That’s a start – these weapons are much needed. They are up against one of the world’s largest and most ruthless armies.  But the battlefield is not the only place where the PM needs to deliver. He also promised visas. He promised that the UK would make the process as easy as possible for desperate refugees. That’s a promise he’s failed to deliver. More accurately, his Home Secretary has failed. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP who took up arms against the Russians, said she was promised visas in three days by Priti Patel – three weeks ago. We’re used to this Government breaking promises. But to renege on a deal made to such desperate people is unforgivable. The joke in the Ukraine is that the visas will land when the war is over. Dark humour but frighteningly close to the bone. Mr Johnson needs to act with the same urgency on this as he did when he sped off to Kyiv. This is not a photo op, not a headline grabber, not an opportunity to spin. It’s about people’s lives. People we promised to help. Time to deliver.  Prove your honour Speaking of promises - it’s time for Prince Andrew to step up. He’s had plenty of chances to prove he remains capable of doing the right thing. He pledged to help victims of sex trafficking as he paid out to his accuser Virginia Giuffre, saying he would atone for his association with Jeffrey Epstein by supporting the fight. Now, victims want him to act.

Removals vans were seen lining up to take furniture and personal items from the flat shared by Mr Sunak and we Akshata Murthy and move them to their newly-refurbished, luxury West London pad. A red velvet armchair, a shelving unit and several bags and boxes were loaded onto two trucks, which arrived at Downing Street’s back gate early on Saturday morning. But the Sunday Mirror understands the move was planned before Mr Sunak’s popularity noseed this week. The family are making the move because their eldest daughter is about to go into her final term of primary school, the Mirror understands. They want to be nearer to her school for the last few months before she goes to boarding school.  Mr Sunak is expected to split his evenings between the Downing Street flat and their Kensington home, but continue to work from Number .Previously a shoe-in to replace Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister, Mr Sunak’s fortunes have been on the wane since last month’s disastrous Spring Statement failed to provide help for families facing a cost of living crisis. This week it was revealed Mrs Murthy enjoyed non-dom tax status - and Mr Sunak had held on to his Green Card as a ‘resident’ of the United Sates for more than a year after becoming Chancellor. It comes amid calls for partners and spouses of ministers to be banned from being non-doms - and avoiding paying tax on money made outside the UK. Labour said Mr Sunak and his family potentially saved tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his weaposs non-dom status. And Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh blasted the chancellor for not being transparent about his family’s tax status. “He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate, she said. Mrs Murty announced on Friday that she would voluntarily pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her financial arrangements to be a distraction for her husband. But she will keep her non-dom status, which allows her to take advantage of India’s zero rate of inheritance tax on her family’s multi-million pound business empire. And the SNP called on Mr Sunak to publish his tax s.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the scandal showed the Chancellor and his we lived in a completely dferent universe in financial terms from ordinary people left struggling by the cost-of-living crisis. The Lib Dems have called on the PM to ban the wives and partners of ministers from using the non-dom “loophole”. Lib Dem Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine said: “Government ministers have a duty to do what’s morally right. When they change peoples’ taxes, they and their immediate families should play by the same rules as everybody .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Rishi SunakBoris JohnsonConservative Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I tend to agree, having lived a semi-itinerant lestyle in the early part of my career.So, pity poor Rishi Sunak, who is shting furniture this weekend.I’m not entirely sure how useful he’ll be – given that he’s a short bloke . Maybe he’ll help pack a side table or two, chest of drawers maybe. But I can’t see him on the other end of a piano, ­especiallythey’re aiming to sht it upstairs.Stressful as relocation is, though, it will be the least of his worries this weekend. Pals are saying that, ­politically, he’s going through a bad time. The worst time, they say – and it’s going to get worse. Earlier this week, the Chancellor lashed out at the political storm around him. It was a hit-job, he said. No need to bring my we into it, he said, I haven’t done anything wrong, he said. Meh. I kind of agree with the first part. There’s a game going on in Westminster at the moment, trying to work out who has put the hex on Mr Sunak. To recap, he’s in some political ­trouble because it has emerged that his we, Akshata Murty, has, to put it mildly, a convoluted tax set-up. The point being, it’s not a massively good look for the Chancellor’s we to have been a non-dom when she’s quite clearly living here. In Downing Street. With the Chancellor. But, you know, I guess that’s just optics. Who’s behind it, how did this news leak out, everyone wants to know  Some people are pointing the finger of blame at Number . Mr Sunak has been billed as a future Prime Minister, a serious leadership rival, and this could well be “the ­machine” taking him out.  There are still some elements in there who are angry with the Chancellor for not backing the PM over Partygate. But that’s probably not right here. Nor is the rumour that the story was whipped up by Labour, although it has not done them any harm at all. In fact, as it rumbles on, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Mr Sunak is an electoral weak spot and a nice target to apply some pressure on. Open goal, really, a millionaire Chancellor married to a woman who had non-dom status, while the rest of us are skint. Open goal, and gives Labour some purchase in an area where they have been outclassed by the Tories over the past decade. Even at the height of austerity, the Tories still managed to frame Labour as weak on the economy. Not this time, not with an easy narrative, and an easy target like this. Anyway. It was probably neither of them. Just some fine journalism that sparked this whole thing. But it’s been seized on, naturally, and the level of mud-slinging will step up over the coming weeks. Mr Sunak is not happy, neither is his inner circle, andhe thinks Number  is behind the briefings, he’ll continue to lash out. Nothing to lose now, I suppose, as it looks like the Chancellor’s leadership hopes are over for now. Isn’t that the Tories all over  There’s already a war raging , miles away. Trust them to start another one.

Amid an ongoing row over Rishi Sunakaposs weaposs non-dom status, the Health Secretary came clean about his own use of the scheme before entering Parliament in . Mr Javid also admitted to benefitting from an offshore trust when he worked for Deutsche Bank but said he voluntarily collapsed the trust when he became a minister in . Labour blasted him for hypocrisy over the revelations, which came after the Tories hiked national insurance contributions for millions of Brits last week.Non-dom status is a legal scheme that allows people domiciled abroad to avoid paying UK tax on their overseas income.  The arrangement has come under scrutiny after it emerged that Mr Sunakaposs we Akshata Murty held non-dom status, which could have spared her paying millions of pounds in UK tax.Ms Murty bowed to intense political pressure on Friday and said she will now pay UK tax on her overseas income, which includes an estimated £. million a year in idends from her billionaire fatheraposs IT firm Infosys.In a statement first reported by the Sunday Times, Mr Javid said: I have been domiciled in the UK for tax purposes throughout my entire public le. Given heightened public interest in these issues, I want to be open about my past tax statuses. After a posting in New York between  and , where he paid US taxes, Mr Javid ed to the UK where he was a tax resident.He said: “For some of those years I was non-domiciled for tax purposes, but I paid all UK taxes due on my income and have always done so. It is unclear where he was domiciled during this period but it is understood not to have been Pakistan, where his father was born. Mr Javid went on: “In  I moved to Singapore with my family and was therefore no longer a UK tax resident. In , upon myto the UK, I became tax-resident in the UK again and also proactively chose to give up my non-domiciled status by making the UK my ‘domicile of choice’. He became an MP in  and went on to hold a number of Cabinet jobs, including Chancellor from  to . Mr Javid also admitted to having some financial investments based in an offshore trust before he ed to the UK and entered Parliament.  He said: While this was an entirely legitimate arrangement, on becoming a minister in  I decided to voluntarily collapse that trust, repatriate all assets to the UK and pay  per cent income tax on those assets. “This approach deliberately incurred the heaviest possible tax burden, and offset any accrued benefits from the previous trust arrangement, but I believed it was the right thing to do.”Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: Last week Sajid Javid was lecturing struggling taxpayers about their duty to pay higher taxes, but this is the guy who spent six years as a non-dom and had an offshore trust to avoid paying his fair share of tax in Britain.Even now, he refuses to sayhe was using a tax haven. The hypocrisy stinks. The luxury of being able to choose how much tax you pay, where you pay it, and when you pay it, is not one that is enjoyed by most people in this country.

But critics fear the posts will be offered to ex-town hall officials in a revolving door of failure. The successful candidates – who will receive almost five times the salary of the average council worker – are expected to “live, breathe and champion” the places they represent. But it remains unclear what the roles will actually involve. The Levelling Up department was created to “drive prosperity” across the whole of the UK, not just London.  Wolverhampton, Truro in Cornwall and Hastings in East Sussex are among the areas looking for directors. But John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “These pricey pen-pushers will end up costing the very people they’re trying to help a fortune in taxes. The best way to level up is by allowing families and firms to keep more of their own money and giving them more say over how taxes are spent.” The job news comes after it emerged some , council fatcats pocketed more than £, last year. Lisa Nandy, Shadow Levelling Up Secretary, said: “It is vital these directors provide value for money for the taxpayer and understand the communities they are serving. “Levelling Up can’t be about rearranging the deckchairs or more bureaucracy – it’s about good jobs for everyone, money in people’s pockets, and empowering people to make the decisions that affect communities.”Harry Quilter-Pinner, director of the IPPR think-tank, warned against recruiting from the “old guard” oflocal politics and said the Government must instead “reach out to women, people of colour and people from working-class backgrounds”.A government spokesman said: “Directors will be working collaboratively with local leaders across all sectors to drive innovative proposals.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sunday MirrorLevelling Up Watch,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But after contacting the Deva office and receiving no answer, he sent a text message explaining the situation he was facing. The message said: Mate can you call me, am getting chest pains and keep going dizzy am gonna have to go and get checked out.  I started getting pains in my chest, feeling dizzy and I was getting sweaty. I ignored it for a minute or two but I started thinking no, this does not feel right. So I pulled over and phoned the office, but it rang out, so I texted the work mobile number that I was getting chest pains and the manager rang me back. I askedsomeone could come and get my packages because I wanted to go to the hospital. They told me someone could come and take half my route off me but that they couldnapost do any more than that. A spokesman for Deva said the company sent a driver to assist and believed Neil had been relieved of all his packages - a claim which Neil strongly refutes. Instead said he felt he had no option but to carry on with the route. Neil said: I didnapost realise how serious it was at the time. But it went on right through the afternoon, just getting worse and worse.  The dizzy spells were so bad I kept having to pull over because I couldnapost see anything. Despite his worrying symptoms Neil ploughed on with his sht and dropped the van back at the depot at around .pm, hours after the symptoms began. He said: When I got back to the depot my manager asked meI was alright to work tomorrow and said he had a smaller route over the water I can go on. I said I need to go to hospital first before I start thinking about packages. He ed home and went straight to AE at Whiston Hospital with his we, Susan Martin. Doctors quickly established something was seriously wrong, and Neil says his heart rate was around  beats per minute rather than the usual . Neil was kept in as an inpatient for the next  days, where he underwent extensive testing including an angiogram and was given medication to keep his heart rate under control. After being stabilised he was transferred to Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital for an MRI scan before being allowed home to recuperate. Neil said: The doctors told me I had already had a heart attack and asked me why I had waited so long before coming in. I was disgusted. It made me feel like delivering packages was more important than my health. I am not blaming them for me having a heart attack, but I feel like I could have died on that road and they didnapost care. A spokesman for Deva said: We take the safety of the independent, self-employed contractors we engage with, very seriously, and we are still investigating how the incident was handled. As soon as we learned Neil was unwell, one of our four standby contractors was sent to relieve him of the load and as far as we were concerned Neil had received the support that he had requested. We were not aware that Neil had been left with packages. Had we been aware we would have immediately sent another driver to relieve him. We have people on standby specically to cover routes which need support at short notice, including a driver needing to finish early, illness or in the case of traffic issues or vehicle breakdown. A couple of days later our site manager texted Neil to see how he was. Neil explained what was happening, thanked the manager and a thumbs up emoji for getting in touch and would keep him informed on his progress. A spokesman for Amazon said: “Safety is a top priority and we wish the delivery driver a speedy recovery.

However the name caused a massive row in the royal family and was even raised in the Houses of Parliament, resulting in a rt between the Queen and her husband.  It didnapost appear on an official document until , but the complicated story behind the name dates all the way back to .Before marrying The Queen and becoming the Duke of Edinburgh, Philipaposs official title was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.However, his name wasnapost considered to be neutral enough so he adopted the name Mountbatten after his grandparents. When the then Princess Elizabeth had the coupleaposs first child, Prince Charles, in , he assumed, due to tradition, that their little one would take his name.  However, when Elizabeth went on to become Queen in , she had to confirm the official surname of the Royal Family and many wanted her to continue using Windsor, instead of changing it to Mountbatten. Winston Churchill is said to have been an advocate for the Royals using the name Windsor and The Queenaposs grandmother, Queen Mary, agreed.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here. It is said to have caused such an issue that the matter was even discussed in Parliament. In the end, the Queen decided to support her familyaposs views and the name Windsor was used.At the time, Philip reportedly said: I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.The topic continued to bother him for years to come, but it wasnapost until  that Elizabeth decided to do something more about it. When the couple fell pregnant with their third child, Elizabeth was Queen and Philip was still keen for his children to have his surname. So in , Her Majesty is said to have gone to see Harold Macmillan, who had then taken over as PM. She said she absolutely needed to revisit the issue and admitted it had been irritating her husband since . Finally, a comprise was met, and on February ,  -  days before Prince Andrew was born - the Queen declared that she had adopted the name Mountbatten-Windsor. She announced that it would be used by all her descendants who do not enjoy the title of His or Her Royal Highness. And as we have seen, itaposs still used today. A statement on the Royal website explains: The Royal Family name of Windsor was confirmed by The Queen after her accession in . However, in , The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh decided that they would like their own direct descendants to be distinguished from the rest of the Royal Family , as Windsor is the surname used by all the male and unmarried female descendants of George V. It was therefore declared in the Privy Council that The Queenaposs descendants, other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince Princess, or female descendants who marry, would carry the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.

Trafficked into the UK, she was tasered and forced to have threesomes, gang bangs, and sleep with  men a night. “It was the most traumatic time of my le, she says. Her horric ordeal left her with addictions to drugs and sex after she was farmed around dferent cities as her home was turned into a drugs hub.Natalie, who is going under a dferent name, said she would be lucky to get two hours’ sleep a night and wouldn’t see a penny from her sex work that she carried out over  months in dferent cities across the UK, reports WalesOnline. I had tasers to me, she says, At the time I did not realise how bad it actually was. It was a gang who kidnapped me and held me captive. I was stuck in my bedroom with a lock on the door and they took over my house. I was not there for  months and it was like a drugs hub, I was not sure what was going on.”  A victim of child abuse had made her vulnerable and she says she was naive as to how the gang had operated, who had been operating in Wales for two decades, Natalie says. She adds: “I was taken to Liverpool, that was probably the scariest time. That was the first time I was tied up. If I had spoken out I would have been killed and I thought my daughter would have it, it was mad.” At the time, Natalie admits she was a cocaine addict which left her in their debt and under their control. She continues: “They had seen the amount of money I was spending on cocaine - I was a coke addict. I was buying coke off them. It’s how I became involved in all of it.. I was sold to the sex trade.... I needed someone to find me.” As she was trafficked across Britain she barely slept to keep up with the demands of her kidnappers. The horror of being raped and abused is one she was familiar with. “Sometimes I would have sex  or  times a day all day,” she says. “I would only have two hours’ sleep a day and not even that. Me and my associate would be made to do stuff together and made more money. I would have to have threesomes and gang bangs. It was terrying, especially the trauma.”  She adds: “I was there for  months, that was not just in that one city it was everywhere. It was not in one place. I was in Liverpool for six weeks, I was not allowed out, I was in a room. I think I went to the south of the country after that - it was not as bad. “Obviously, it’s bad but I didn’t have tasers to me - it wasn’t as damaging there. I was there .for about four months, it was a normal house. London and Liverpool was the scariest one. London was bad - it was worst than the city in the south. I was in London for about six months, all I would do is work. In the whole time I didn’t sleep in any way and I couldn’t really sleep. After I had been gone for four months I never thought anyone would find me. Natalie has since been able to turn her le around, but the emotional scars remain and she still lives in fear. It was only on herto Wales that the brutal reality of her existence was finally uncovered but it was a struggle to speak out and reveal what had happened to her. The challenge now is living with the fear the crime gang remain at large. Natalie, now , said she was worried she would be discovered. “They didn’t jail them they are still out there,” she says. “They have been arrested but no jail sentence has been given for it. I get scared they may find me, I am petried. Now I just feelthey wanted to find me they probably would. I think I have moved on even to do with sex work, all that has all stopped. It’s because I had a sex addiction and I have seen love as through sex. aposFor me to be proud of myself is a thingapos Her le since her abduction has not been easy. She has endured spells of homelessness and drug abuse and found it dficult to maintain relationships. She ed to sex work on the streets when she did not know what  to do, although she says she has not done sex work for two years now. She has had four children, none of whom are in her care. Yet she says she has beaten her addictions to cocaine and crack cocaine and now only smokes weed. Her addiction to sex has been tougher to break and is something she still wrestles with.Natalie says: “My sex addiction was hard to overcome, I was working with BAWSO [an organisation that provides emotional support to black minority ethnic and migrant victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, human trafficking]- I had  sessions and four extra sessions so I had a total of  hours support to help me,” she says. “I had to retrain my brain.I was working with a support group and I ended up working with one of the workers. She helped me a lot with my sex addiction -I do not have sex for two weeks I am fine. It’s breaking the cycle of not wanting it all of the time. She says she is now focused on her children and has been through three years of intensive support thanks to Safer Wales, which offers support to those who are invisible in society and work to protect victims of sexual exploitation from danger. Without them the woman would not have been able to move on into a dferent le and have a roof over her head. Her plan is to build a brighter future for not just herself but others who have struggled through their teens. “My Safer Wales worker has been there for tears and laughter, she has been through my three-year journey,” she said. “For me to be proud of myself is a thing - I was never proud before, now I could not be happier. “Two weeks ago I was given my flat - it’s all guns going with all the decorating. I think of the now, I try to bury everything - I shouldn’t but I do. I want to go to uni and do health and social care and open a rehab from  to -year-olds, I want to help people who have gone through dficult times when they are going through adolescence and offer a better start in the care system.” Natalie adds: “If I had a better start in le I would not have got into a situation of drugs and the trafficking. I never thought I was going to survive - it was like my world had ended and I was a no one.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON ProstitutionCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Have you experienced any issues  Email webnews@mirror  Ours has never worked since we moved into our new home in September , he told The Mirror. Their actual meters have been faulty and my husband and I were successful in an ombudsman complaint for service failures during the meter issue. However, one thing BG have not got right is the internal smart meter that remains unfixed. Since September we are on our th smart meter. That is a low conservative guess.The smart meter fails to demonstrate correct usage.  One model said I was using £, per day in electric. The app only has electric data for February  and  now and I genuinely do not know how they intend to recty.As a result of a faulty meter we have been unable to adjust any of our energy habits since moving into our new property. He shared a photo of a day he said the meter showed £. Another customer, who wished to stay anonymous, told The Mirror: Both my gas and electric are supplied by British Gas. My smart meter stopped working as of the March . Unfortunately no engineer available until the July .  Not a happy customer, the worst is trying to speak to anyone. He added: The smart meter is showing all zeros and not actually recording any details whatsoever, a spokesman from British Gas acknowledged they are not receiving any information either. I am aged  and am down as urgent on receiving help under British Gas terms and conditions. I find  weeks too long to resolve the situation. Charlotte, who described herself as a disgruntled customer, told us: I too have experienced this issue since February. I have tried to speak to BG with no success, finally resulting to an online chat that was a waste of time. Like your other readers suggest something fishy is going on and as a customer that used the BG app daily to check consumption I am concerned that my current direct payment will be incorrect.

I hope my inidual story will help with highlighting the underhand actions of one of our fuel giants and the way that they are treating their loyal customers at a time of increased anxiety. A mum said: Our smart meter now by am reads over £. and we haven’t even used any electric or gas yet today- well be it minimal as we have actually got up.By the end of today it will show nearly £. - this is minimal use and no use of a washing machine or tumble drier.It’s shocking I have no idea how we will afford to keep our children warm by this winter at the price we seem to be being charged.

And Brits have been united in their despair, reports NorthWalesLive. National Insurance, council tax, and food and fuel prices have all increased due to the crisis, and experts have warned that the spikes wonapost start slowing anytime soon. Those that use smart meters were all under the impression that this would help keep cost down and also under control, as it helps monitor the bills. Unfortunately, customers of British Gas have come out in their droves complaining about something fishy going on.Love was certainly not lost on aposThe British Gas complaints pageapos Facebook page.

She posted: Finally spoke to BG re my Warm Home Discount. I was informed that everyone should receive their payments by th April. If nothing has been received by then, to call back  only then, can they make payment, directly to the meter...! Nicky Hitchcock was equally outraged about the apparent overcharging.

Martin Lewis and his Money Saving Expertteam asked social media followers for their best tips to help people who are suffering amid the c ost-of-living crisis. The team has compiled the Cost of Living Survival Guide to help Brits weather the price hikes, Hull Live reports.Families are expected to feel the sting this month as energy bills and National Insurance are increased. Council tax, fuel prices and food are also going up, leading to more people feeling the pinch. Introducing his teamaposs tips, Martin Lewis wrote: For some there is sadly no route to cut expenditure below income that fix will need political intervention.  For others, we need a collective endeavour, to work together to take financial pressures off where we can. And that is partly behind this guide. He explained the team had received thousands of replies from people with clever ideas about how to cut household expenditure. Martin described the response - which included more than , replies to his tweet alone - as overwhelming and uplting. One of the tips was to invest in a slow cooker to batch cook meals for all the family. They are available from Asda for as little as £. The Money Saving Expert team said batch cooking creates less food waste and reduces the likelihood of spending extra cash on takeaways.  One follower said they are apossaving a fortuneapos by using theirs more and more. Sharron Quaile wrote: A chef was on TV recently telling us all to get a slow cooker, as it costs p to cook a meal overnight. Made a cracking chilli the other night, gave my neighbour a portionand thereaposs one portion in the freezer. A user under the name of Living in Hope wrote: Iaposm using my slow cooker more and more these days to batch cook delicious soups, curries, stews etc then I freeze it in recycled takeaway containers. Saves a fortune all round. They added it did not cost much to invest in. It’s a standard sized one, only cost me about £ - very simple, no whistles or bells, but does the job, they wrote. The MSE guide also says that using a microwave is generally cheaper than an oven. It states a jacket potato would be more than  per cent cheaper to cook in the microwave rather than the oven.

Indre Razutyte, , was found unresponsive in her kitchen by her ex-partner on March .CPR was performed at the home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, but Indre was declared dead. Suicide notes were found in the kitchen, Yorkshire Live reports.Indre leaves behind a two-year-old daughter. Wakefield Coroneraposs Court heard on Friday that Indre was much loved by her colleagues at small transport firm Centika Logistics. The mother was a transport manager there, and made such an impression on me immediately. Colleague Wayne Kearns, who joined the company in September last year, said: Weaposre a small company, more like a family. Because of that I worked closely with Indre and we became good friends. She was like a little sister to me.  She did used to sometimes talk about the issues she was facing, but it was such a shock to hear about her death and so heartbreaking. Weaposd spoken the day before when she was working from home. That day me and the manager had been messaging her because she hadnapost come in. Losing Indre has felt like losing a member of the family. She was one of the nicest and kindest people I have ever met, she would help anybody. She was so nice, and I donapost think she realised how lovely a person she was and how loved she was. I think she was worried about being left on her own. Indreaposs heartbroken family live in Lithuania, and are hoping to repatriate her home for a funeral there.Wayne and some of Indreaposs other colleagues have set up a GoFundMe page to help them pay for the costs of getting Indre home.As of April , the page is at £,. Any money left over from the fundraising will be put into a trust fund for Indreaposs two-year-old daughter. When we had drivers at the company who were having a bad day and would snap at anyone , Indre was the only one who could calm them down. Customers would ask for her specically. She could relate to anybody and I donapost think she realised how great she was, Wayne added. She was really good at her job and just at talking to people. We always had a laugh in the office together. If she was feeling down Iaposd go to Morrisons and get us cake. Indre made such a big impact on me straight away. I wish I couldaposve had the time to get to know her even better. The full inquest has been adjourned to a later date. Assistant coroner John Hobson did recount in brief the events that preceded Indreaposs death being recorded.The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

Mick lost his job and then his home before ending up on the streets of London with his Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Benson, in . He told MyLondon : “Without him, I think I would have gone under.And he wouldn’t be able to survive without me, simply because of our bond. We’re together  . He understands me, I understand him. He’s the only thing I put my trust into and he’s never let me down.” But because of his beloved -year-old pooch, the Londoner has struggled for seven years to get housing. Their bond has only grown stronger over the years since Mick, who asked to only be called his first name, adopted Benson from his previous owner, who couldnapost take care of him anymore, at -months-old.  “How could I say no to him ” said the Londoner lovingly. “When he was three, I lost my job, then couldn’t afford my rent so lost my property, and ended up on the streets. I wrestled with my conscience over whether it was right to keep him - but he’s been through so much upheaval, I couldn’t not.”The duo appeared on the hit ITV show Paul OaposGrady: For the Love of Dogs and are known in their local area, around Liverpool Street and Hackney, with people like the shop owners, taxi drivers and station owners all keeping an eye on Benson.“I’m always conscious of him - that people might try and take him, said the -year-old, Rest and sleep is the hardest thing on the streets - you’re sleeping with one eye open.” He said: “Everything has to be centred around him and I have to worry about what’s going to happen to him. And then you can’t take him to certain services.”This includes many accommodation options for those who are experiencing homelessness. In fact, only around  percent of hostels in the UK are pet friendly, according toStreetVet , a charity working to increase this statistic and delivering free veterinary care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness around the country. According to StreetVet, to apply for housing benefits, some form of address is required. A hostel address is usually used for this, but as Mick said he struggles to get into hostels with Benson, he is unable to even get started with the benefits process. He also noted that many housing associations will not accept dogs. “You get accused of making yourself intentionally homeless so they don’t take any responsibility,” he said. “I’ve been trying to get housed for seven years. You get the choice between your room and your pet - that’s not a choice. They’re not acknowledging the support of Benson as important in my le, despite my health conditions.” Mick suffers with anxiety and depression, which he said contributed to losing his job. He believes he would have turned to drink and drugsit had not been for Benson. He said: “He’s my escape and gives me something to focus on. He’s a mainstay in my le and keeps me grounded. If he’s not around me, I feel lost - I feel secure when I’m with him. He’s not so much for protection as he is for comfort. You look at him and think, ‘It ain’t all bad - Iaposve got him. As long as I’ve got him, I’m okayapos. He added: “When you’re on the street, so many things can happen. If I start getting heated with someone, he can bring me back down. He reminds me that there are more important things. If anything would happen to me, then what would happen to him  If anything happened to him, then that would kill me, andanything happened to me then that would kill him - that’s it.” Mick claims that Bensonaposs role in apossaving his leapos has not been taken into consideration in his attempts to find a home for the both of them. Even during the pandemic, he claims he was not offered a room with his dog. He added: “I’d sooner take the risk on the street with my boy than be separated from him - simple. He also says knows some people have only just had their pets ed to them.He said: “The authorities didn’t grasp the bond between man and dog.” Founder of StreetVet Jade Statt explained that some places in the UK were better than others at housing owners with their pets - but the resounding feedback from her clients was that a poor effort was made in London. “They didn’t realise that people who have pets and are homeless are much less likely to engage in antisocial behaviour because that would end up in them being separated from their dog. You have a reason, a role, a responsibility,” said Jade. She added: “Because that dog was everything to them”. Summing up his dreams for the future, Mick said: “My dream is to have somewhere to call home - a self-contained property where me and Benson can live out our days.

However many churches have now realised their leather muffles are rotten as they have not been used since King George VIaposs death  years ago.As a result, leatherworkers have been inundated with orders as churches rush to ensure theyaposre ready for the sad day, reports the Mail on Sunday. Sales have reportedly doubled in the past few months. Vicki Chapman, from the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, told the newspaper that adding the muffle turns the bellsapos normal dong, dong, dong into more of a thudding sound. She said: We have spent a lot of time talking to the Royal Household and Lambeth Palace about the day the monarch passes, which we hope will not be any time soon. It is important as it is about paying due reverence to the service of the monarch and commemorating her le.”  Last year full details of Operation London Bridge were leaked, giving a full day-to-day run down of what will happen when the Queen passes away. The day will be known as D Day, with the days following called D Day plus the number of days that have passed. For example the second day will be D Day Plus One. Prince Charles - who will become King upon his motheraposs passing - will address the nation on the day of her death, while the Prime Minister will be the first government member to issue a statement. Government departments have been instructed to have flags at half mast within  minutes of the announcement, with Cabinet members set to be called with the sad news and urged to show discretion.  The Queen will be buried  days after she dies, it is expected, and Charles will embark on a tour of the UK before the burial is held. The sovereignaposs coffin will lie in state for three days at the Houses of Parliament, with authorities anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to descend on London - sparking fears over gridlock, policing and even food shortages. Any other Parliamentary business is set to be suspended for  days, it is reported. The day of the funeral will be a Day of National Mourning, but employers will not be compelled to give staff a day off. The service will take place at Westminster Abbey, and a two minute silence will be held across the UK at noon. A committal service will be held at St Georgeaposs Chapel, which is at Windsor Castle, where the Queen will be buried at King George VI Memorial Chapel.

The tornado was confirmed as there was plenty of evidence of objects being airborne and spinning around the circulation before falling to the ground, he said.  He added that he believed it had a strength of between mph-mph. Deilwen Breese, owner of Gogarth Hall Farm, said she was away from the farm when she received a phone call telling her to come home. Ms Breese told the PA news agency she did not realise the scale of the damage until she got back. I thought it was just that part of the roof had gone, she said. But oh my god, when I came home I could not believe it. Ms Breese said she was still in shock from the incident. The devastation, it was heartbreaking, she said. I am still in shock, really. Ms Breese added: Trees had been lted from their roots. If they hadnapost been lted they had just been tarnished. We have lost hundreds of trees. The winds were so strong that a ewe and its lambs were lted into the air. Ms Breese said: It took a ewe out through the bay of a shed, and it picked up the little lambs. She said the lambs were fine, but the ewe was gone. Ms Breese said that the damage to the roof was about £,. When I got to the farm I could see the damage to the roof, itaposs about £, worth of damage on the roof. She said a group of  local volunteers were now helping her clear the devastation. However, Ms Breese feels that the farm will not be the same. She said: Itaposs going to take months, it will never get back, not in my letime. It will never come back to what it was.

Sixteen members of the Radford clan reached Florida despite previous worries of getting the brood through the long delays. Mum Sue and dad Noel successfully left their Morecambe home to jet off to a sunnier Florida where the kids can be seen having a blast as Disney World.Posting on Instagram Sue provided snippets of the journey including some brief shots in the airport, Lancashire Live reports.Clips show the kids running along the airport travellators, looking out at the window to the their plane and then finally, seated and on their way to the Easter holiday. But it wasnapost smooth sailing getting there. In a recent vlog, Sue spoke from the families home in Morecambe about the checklist of things needed to be done before getting on the plane. One of those tasks included getting a Covid test for everyone.  Speaking to fans in their aposmost tense vlog everapos, Sue explained that the day before they left for the airport they would have to take  Covid tests in appointment slots with an online witness. The four appointments included four family members at a time and just one negative test could write off the highly anticipated holiday for the entire family. Sue said: Iaposm hoping, fingers crossed, that everybody is negative. I canapost even begin to tell you how nervous I am about these tests. I did not sleep very well last night because obviouslysomeone is positive, we canapost go and weaposll have to rearrange it.I keep thinking it wonapost be the end of the worldwe do have to rearrange it, I think the situation with Manchester Airport at the minute is an absolute nightmare andIaposm honest, Iaposm not keen on doing that because I think itaposs taking two and a half, three hours, to get through security, checking-in as well is taking about an hour. Obviously when youaposve got sixteen of us, you can well double that, so probably about five hours for us by that time we probably would have missed our flight.  She continued: Iaposm not wanting to go through that, I must admit. So Iaposm thinking, it wonapost be the end of the worldone of us does test positive, we can just rearrange it for later in the year but obviously the kids will be absolutely devastated. But no signs of those fears affecting the trip were shown in the short but sweet video she posted. The only mention of the airport madness was in the comments as one person said: Oh Iaposm over the moon you are there and safe! The news is horrible re Manchester airport. Sue replied: It really is itaposs awful for all the staff on the frontline getting all the abuse. The Radfords continue to document their Easter break on Instagram with talk of a Disneyland vlog coming up too.

Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t disapprove of her at all, that’s her business. She’s great. But my family is staunchly religious. So much that my mom said thatthe wedding was not held in a chapel she would not be attending. I know it’s ridiculous but it’s my family. And it’s not just her, it’s that entire side with the exception of a few cousins and my siblings. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. This is a problem because of how recognisable she is. I’ll fully admit that prior to meeting her, I had watched a few of her videos just because of how viral they are. I’m sure other guys there will have seen her videos too, andsomething gets mentioned or pointed out it could cause so much drama that I really don’t want to deal with on the wedding day. He continued by saying he doesnapost want the attention to be taken off the woman heaposs marrying because half the people there have seen one of the bridesmaids getting intimate online. But when he brought up his concerns with the bride, she wasnapost happy. She told me that she is one of her closest friends and that she’s not moving her out of our wedding just to appease my mother, he adds.She told me that the way I was behaving was gross and I was being an a**hole. Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on the situation, and the majority said that he was in the wrong. One person said: If your family is oh-so-righteously religious, how is it possible any of them know what her work is  Another wrote: Tell your family to not be so prejudiced. A third commented: I believe this wholeheartedly: You cannot judge someone for what they do for a livingyou engage in their labour. If you and your family watch adult videos, you have contributed to creating the demand for her work. It’s pretty audacious for you and your family to sit on your high horse and judge her for doing sex work when you’ve actively contributed to the market that requires it. Someone  put: If you donapost grow a set and stick up for your we your marriage is doomed.

But thanks to YouTube she has completely transformed her place on a budgetCarrie Kline with husband Adam and sons Rolly, three, Ruben, two, and Odie, six months. Image: Jam PressByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  Apr |commentsA mum transformed her family home for less than £ – learning DIY skills from YouTube videos. Carrie Kline, , a stay-at-home mum from Minnesota, US, and husband, Adam, , purchased a four-bed, detached home for ,in June . It was love at first sight for Carrie, who recalls the house feeling like home. The open layout and the space were a blank canvas, which gave her the opportunity to turn the house into a happy, airy and colourful place. But having no DIY experience, she enlisted the help of YouTube and got to work learning the fundamentals needed to transform the space. Firstly, she started by working on the living room, where she spent on shiplap boards for wall decoration and on pieces of pine wood to build a picture frame and floating shelves. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I purchased a giant canvas from a thrt store and made my own art over it by mixing paint and spackle together, Carrie said. I built my own frame using pine and hung this on the wall as a statement piece. The shiplap was pre-primed MDF and I attached this using a nail gun, followed by painting it white.[Finally] I built my own floating shelves which hold my cookbooks and cutting boards.” In total, she spent on transforming her living space into a cosy area. In the master bedroom, she spent three days revamping the space with a few simple steps. She said: I primed and painted the entire room, with white on the top half and tan on the bottom.  I bought some lattice strips to do picture moulding around the bottom of my walls, which I cut to size using a mitre saw. I nailed these on and painted them tan to match the wall. Using a pine board, I built a trim piece that went around the room and served as a ider between the tan and white. On the wall behind our bed, I used faux brick ling and screwed these onto the wall, before painting them white.  I built a very simple shelf out of poplar wood with some brackets and all of this completely transformed the room. In our powder room, it felt dark and small, so I painted this white and added a colourful floral mural on the wall. I built some more floating shelves and kept the existing vanity mirror, but changed the look by covering it in cement, using lattice strips and painting it pink. I painted [the kids’ bathroom] and added faux herringbone tile backsplash by using paint.  I used a Sharpie pen to draw out the grout line so that people think it’s real tiling. For the mirror, I used lattice strips again and painted them black, as well as the light fixture and water faucet. I made a gallery wall using thrted picture frames and painted another floral mural on the other wall.” In total, she spent turning the bathroom into a light, fresh space.Carrie’s favourite area is her front porch, as she always wanted somewhere to relax and watch her kids play on a summer evening. She painted and stencilled the area with a floral design and refinished second-hand furniture, as well as hanging some lights and baskets to make the space feel homely. She juggled her projects while her sons, Rolly, three, Ruben, two, and Odie, six months, were sleeping she said, and managed to turn around the final product within a few days.  She said: I really value my time with the kids, as I know how quickly time can pass. I started DIY as a creative outlet for myself, so I made a goal to work on projects while they’re sleeping. They’ve learned to sleep through most noises really well, so I don’t need to try and work quietly. There has been plenty of times when they’ve woken up mid-project, but I’ve learned to accept that things don’t always go according to plan.  I’ve transformed my laundry room into a mini-workshop, where I created storage space for all my tools and paints. Having my tools accessible means I can get started much quicker as soon as they fall asleep, as well as making clean up time easy. In total, Carrie estimates that she’s spent transforming the property into her perfect family home. As she’s worked on a budget, she has many tips which help to keep costs low without having to sacrice quality.  Carrie added: I don’t let any material go to waste as I’m always saving every bit of wood I have and finding ways to use the scrap for my next project. I often purchase paint from the aposoopsapos section in stores or even mix my own colours using paint I have on hand. Always shop thrt stores or build yourself before buying anything new. I’ll always choose the route of saving money, evenit takes more time. We’ve added so much moreto the house, so I definitely feel we’ve added lots of value in appeal.I have zero plans for slowing down and I’m participating in an online event where I have eight weeks to complete my bathroom on a budget. For me, DIY is so much more than the finished product and there’s not much I’d rather do than build and create something. I share my projects online because I hope to inspire and give courage to other women who also want to learn because it’s been so le-changing for me. You don’t have to wait for a full remodel before you can make a signicant impact. Start small and learn to enjoy the process.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The two-year-old Jack Russell Terrier is the star landmine finder and mascot of the Chernihiv bomb disposal squad. The squad confirmed that Patron is its top landmine tracker and has been regularly earning his tasty treat at the end of each day tracking down the explosive devices.  The State Emergency Serviceof Ukraine humorously said Who is a good boy  before adding that Patron continues to help pyrotechnicians in the Chernihiv region to clean the land of Russian aposgtsapos.

Large protests have been held across the country against the Ukraine bloodshed and horric scenes have emerged which have shocked the world from the east of the country.  But those taking part in anti-government demonstrations risk arrest and draconian prison sentences as the government tries to shield Russians from the truth.

The company executive was humbled to see the end result after arriving in Lutsk - now a ghost town - on Friday evening. Mr Blackmore, who founded commercial intelligence specialists Audere International in , said: To be given this incredible reception by the Deputy Mayor of the Oblast, the region where we were going, where there were speeches, and patriotic songs, and the appreciation, made the journey worthwhile.  When you drive through checkpoints, when you drive through cities in curfew, when  per cent of the city of Lutsk - which is , people - have left the city, youaposre going into a ghost town. And when you see what is happening, to be able to bring the aid to the people was a very important journey. Audere, which provides intelligence to parties wishing to make overseas investments, has already been active in the effort in Ukraine since the start of Russiaaposs invasion, helping with evacuations and conducting five resupply operations.Mr Blackmore said it was important that the company, which did business in Russia and eastern Europe before the invasion back, should put our shoulders to the wheel and assist in Ukraine.We had been involved in evacuating people out of Afghanistan last August, he said. We did not expect some seven months later to be involved in a second evacuation, this time in Europe. But when it happened we decided that we did actually want, and we had the right operating template, to be able to contribute to the humanitarian aid, to the evacuation and to providing support for the Ukrainian people. As part of that effort, the company has delivered two tonnes of food and  litres of liquids, as well as essential items like first aid and clothes, and extensive medical supplies. But Mr Blackmore was moved to do something more personal after speaking to an American friend of his, Herb Holtz.  Mr Blackmore explained: He said, aposI want to do something meaningful. aposMy grandfather was Ukrainian, he left in . I want to do something more than write a checkapos. So I said, aposLetaposs buy a couple of ambulances, one each, and letaposs both first take them down, take them into Ukraine, and see the end resultapos. The ambulances were sourced were sourced via a charity in the UK and filled with two tonnes of medical supplies. And although they were delivered to Lutsk, in western Ukraine, Mr Blackmore said he had been assured the vehicles and supplies would be going right to the front line. Theyaposre going to Bucha, for example, he said. And weaposre very happy that the ambulances were really properly prepped, properly serviced, so that we know theyaposre going to last what was obviously going to be a long journey for them. And they, I suspect, are going to get a lot of usethe situation continues as it is right now.  Mr Blackmore praised the generosity of the British people, saying: Thereaposs so many people doing so much, whether theyaposre working in food kitchens, or whether theyaposre helping refugees or whether theyaposre volunteering to drive ambulances to Poland. He said the Ukrainians really appreciate the help and support coming from the UK. And although he said there was a sense of satisfaction from having done his own bit to help, he stressed there was more to be done. What impressed us most was the cheerfulness and the resolve of the Ukrainian people, he said. And itaposs very important that we stand even closer behind them and give them the more support and weaposre going to look to do that ourselves.

He then brazenly struts off with the stolen goods in his mouth before he chews away at it in the shopaposs entrance before dumping it on the step and walking away. During the first heist, the shop assistant was distracted. When she saw the discarded teddy bear on the floor she initially thought it might belong to a friend who had come into the store. It was only when she checked CCTV footage for the store in Coroados, Sao Paulo, that she realised who the real culprit was.  CCTV images show Thor sneakily walking behind a clothes rail where he grabs the teddy bear in his mouth. He then trots off with the loot in his mouth and skips past the unknowing shop owner and customer. Now knowing who the robber was, shop owner Damaris Rodrigues did not want to get fooled again.  He said: Because I viewed the security footage the first time and saw it was the dog, when it came into the shop this time, I was already prepared.” The little pup ed four days later but this time the vigilant shop owner was able to stop the dog before it left her store with another soft toy.  According to the store owner, the dog is called Thor and is always walking around the area. It is unclearThor has an owner or is a stray. Damaris said that she decided to let the dog keep one of the toys, adding: “I’ve never seen anything like this and I never imagined I would find it so adorable after I went through it the first time, because it is not normal that shoplting can be so cute!” She added: “He is super forgiven.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Dogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now pictures have emerged of inside the plant - the site of the worldaposs worst nuclear disaster in  - showing a floor blanketed with discarded clothes, cups and sleeping bags, with underwear and towels hanging from a line below the ceiling.Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy told CNN it is not known where the Ukrainian guards are, but it is feared they have been taken to Russia through Belarus. They were kept here for  days without sufficient lighting and food, he told the American news outlet. They were not allowed outside. On the last day, they were taken away from here in an unknown direction. Today we know nothing about their fate, unfortunately. The Russian military went through all Ukrainian clothes, personal belongings, like dogs, in search of, probably, money, valuables, laptops. There was looting here. The Russian military stole computers and equipment.  Engineer Valeriy Semonov was one of those trapped inside the site and spoke to the BBC about how they had to steal fuel from the Russians when the power was cut off for three days, which could have caused catastrophic results. Radioactive material could have been released, he said, The scale of it, you can well imagine. He added: I wasnapost scared for my le. I was scared about what would happenI wasnapost there monitoring the plant. I was scared it would be a tragedy for humanity. The Chernobyl nuclear plant is no longer a working power station, but it was never fully abandoned and requires constant monitoring after reactor number four exploded  years ago.

In the video, Ukrainian troops are seen tracking an enemy armoured vehicle as it rolls across a field on the outskirts of the south-eastern coastal city of Mariupol.With a single strike, the vehicle appears to blow up and a large plume of dark smoke fills the air.The footage was shared by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Friday with the message: Azov in Mariupol continues to destroy the enemy.The regiment has gained a fearsome reputation for wiping out Russian armour.  According to Ukrainian reports, the Azov Regiment destroyed two other Russian tanks on April . The day before, Azov troops destroyed equipment of several Russian units and ammunition depots in the defence of Mariupol. The regiment also claimed to have eliminated many enemy infantry troops. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February  in what the Kremlin is calling a special military operation. Today marks the th day of the invasion.  From February  to April , the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at an estimated , personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The Ukrainian military also estimates that Russia has lost  tanks, , armoured combat vehicles,  artillery systems,  MLR systems,  anti-aircraft systems,  aircraft,  helicopters, , vehicles, seven vessels,  fuel tankers,  operational-tactical level UAVs,  units of special equipment and four mobile SRBM systems.The Azov Regiment, formerly known as the Azov Battalion and formally called as the Azov Special Operations Detachment, is a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine - the countryaposs national gendarmerie - and is based in Mariupol.  It is an all-volunteer infantry military unit and has an estimated  members. It has far-right origins and a minority of its members are still said to have far-right tendencies. In latest news, at least  people have been killed and dozens injured after rockets hit a train station in the city of Kramatorsk, in the Donbas region, eastern Ukraine, according to the countryaposs authorities. Donbas is where Russia is believed to be stepping up its offensive as it withdraws from the north of Ukraine. Parts of Donbas have been under pro-Russian separatist occupation since . The so-called Donetsk and Luhansk Peopleaposs Republics were recognised as independent states by Russia just days before the invasion was launched.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Surely the council must accept its plans # even as outline proposals # for school clusters should be reconsidered.Teachers are largely opposed, unions are against it, parent councils are certainly in opposition.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home. Bute pressed to find a winner but the Inveraray backline held firm.In the Women#s Camanachd Association Mowi South Division , Dunadd Camanachd scored three goals in either half to defeat Uddingston - at St Ambrose High School in an excellent advert for women#s shinty # both teams fielding young players with a bright future ahead.Dunadd looked slightly nervy starting their first game of the season but a well-taken goal from Eilidh Cameron settled the team.The next  minutes were end-to-end but the Dunadd defence stayed strong with some excellent saves from stand-in goalie Laurene Cameron.At the other end  Eilidh E Cameronwas tenacious and set up Dunadd#s second as she slotted the ball to Rhian McCuaig, who finished superbly for her first goal for the club.Uddingston, though were not going to give up and, after a spell of pressure, Christie Robertson struck an excellent shot straight in the top corner.Dunadd didn#t let heads go down. After some excellent play on the wing, Alice Adair found striker Eilidh Cameron whose shot was judged to be kicked away by the goalie.Cameron didn#t hesitate from the spot and finished low to the goalie#s left.In the second half Dunadd#s experience started to show as they settled into the game.McCuaig completed her brace, Nicola Smyth finished from close in and Cameron went on to get her hat-trick.That winning feeling # Kilmory#s Sandy Leiper in their match against Oban Celtic juniors.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

With his comments on the power of the RMT union when it comes to pay and the provision of an efficient and effective service and the need for cabins on ferries, I wonderedthe answer would be to negotiate with the RMT on the basis that it be given total responsibility for the management and running of all rail and ferry services in Scotland.With such responsibility comes accountability and they just might acknowledge that they have a duty of care for the proper provision of transport and for paying passengers and goods. It would at least be beneficial to see them put their money where their mouth is. If over a period of time the RMT succeeded in managing our transport infrastructure, praise would be justied. If it failed it would then be found wanting and deserve the same fate as Abellio.Ian Gray, Croftamie.TIME TO END THIS FARES DISCREPANCYBEFORE the pandemic I used to travel monthly by train from Arbroath to Gourock to have lunch with old Clan Line shipmates.

A far more appropriate title would have been The BBC Take On Racism In Scotland.Ever since the ghastly death of George Floyd , the BBC has been following an agenda that England is a similar dystopian racist nightmare which few of us would recognise. It flies in the face of recent worldwide academic research stating England is a tolerant multi-cultural society.Clearly, the BBC, as with a criticised Panorama documentary in January , has decided Scotland will be treated in the same way. I would have expected a highly experienced broadcasterto have presented such a sensitive topic but we got young, Scottish, black, former model Jean Johansson. From the start of the documentary she admitted that she had been unaware of racism in Scotland yet, by the end, concluded that we were becoming much more racist, quite a jump in  minutes. As the we of former Rangers player Jonatan Johansson, it was surprising she struggled to name one of the many current black players in Scotland before settling on Chris Iwelumo,who hung up his boots in . One problem, which undermined her argument throughout, was her reliance on historic evidence. Cue the ghastly  coverage of bananas thrown at Mark Walters or solicitor Aamer Anwars abhorrent story of police abuse in . Similar stories in that period were all too commonplace.Surely the documentary should have focussed on the Scotland of today  In  there were , racial incidents reported to the police. The current figure is ,, a reduction of  per cent. Many pupils are taught Modern Studies where race relations, racism, prejudice, discrimination and stereotypes are covered. I would like to think education is having an effect in stamping out the cancer of racism. Certainly the Census of  showed that many of the top jobs in Scotland have many Scots of Chinese, Indian and Pakistani origin. Professor Nasar Meer was convinced that Scots of ethnic origin do suffer discrimination but do not report it. He offered no evidence.My greatest concern was the willingness of Mr Anwar to refer to the Sheku Bayoh case as more evidence of Police Scotland discrimination but this is still under investigation by the public inquiry of Lord Bracadale. Suffice to say PIRC investigated the case and the Lord Advocate brought no charges.Yet again the BBC has tarnished its historic reputation for impartiality.John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing, Fe.WHY NOT CHOOSE LIVING HERE NOVELIST and separatist mouthpiece Irvine Welsh has criticised the Scottish Tories for adapting words from Trainspotting as a device to highlight past and current SNP failings. Fair enough, I guess. But what does Welsh, from the comfort of his Miami sun-lounger, really have to contribute to any discussion about the reality of le in Scotland today  He hasnt lived in Scotland for many years . If he had, perhaps he could at least contribute to the debate in an informed manner, instead of hurling abuse at us from , miles away.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WEST CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE TOOI WATCHED a movie on Netflix the other night called Official Secrets. It tells the story of whistle-blower Katherine Gunns extraordinary effort to highlight the lies of George W Bush and Tony Blair in the lead-up to the Iraq war. She was an amazing lady and risked her freedom to expose the truth. It is particularly relevant at the moment during the Putin-led invasion of Ukraine.Both wars were are illegal, unprovoked acts of aggression, with enormous civilian death tolls involving the complete destruction of innocent countries. Putins Russia has been quite rightly severely sanctioned and hopefully Putin himself politically damaged and on his way out of power. After watching this movie, Messrs Bush and Blair were no better when it came to Iraq shame on them both. The so-called democrats of the West can be just as destructive when it suits them.Paul Morrison, Glasgow.WE SHOULD STOP FOREIGN AIDTHE latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says what the  countries in the world have to do to tackle climate change, but few are listening.

However, Holyrood and local authorities lack the powers to do this and Anas Sarwar wouldn’t even sign a joint-party letter demanding the devolution of these powers. Also, Labour voted against doubling the Scottish Child Payment to help hard-pressed families.Other than high energy costs, Brexit is the biggest cause of UK austerity and falling exports is causing real problems for our businesses, yet Sir Keir Starmer told LBC on Wednesday that “theres no case for rejoining the EU” and is in favour of the most expensive nuclear energy option which will add hundreds on to household bills for years to come. Scotland can’t afford UK Labour in power.As a leading energy-exporting country Scotland does not need nuclear power stations and should be focusing on the production of hydrogen fuel cells, the clean energy future for gas boilers, cars and ferries.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.* GROWING up in the s, we were informed that Scotland led the world with nuclear power. It was a nonsense of course. Scotland had and has no nuclear industry: we do not design, build or export our nuclear expertise.Nuclear power remains hugely expensive and dficult to build, needs guaranteed access to coolant at a time of increasingly serious climate events requires costly state intervention with subsidies, insurance and security. There is no long-term solution to waste. Scotland should utilise its share of funding to build expertise and an export industry around tidal power and green hydrogen.I actually heard a trade union rep complain that without nuclear power Scotland, as part of the UK grid, would partly rely on England’s gas-powered electricity generator. Was he really unaware that much of that gas originates in Scotland GR Weir, Ochiltree.* I HAVE been following the reaction to the UK Government’s decision to go nuclear and maintain its restrictions on onshore turbines.I wonder thoughyet again Westminster is missing yet another cheaper option.Why are we not placing bladeless turbines up and down our motorways and trunk roads  The turbines, while not quite as efficient as their bladed cousins, are cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain. Further, placing them along the roadways both avoids many planning constraints and provides another source of generation as well as the wind, ie passing vehicles. Just think, all those lampposts powered for free and the excess used to power service stations and homes nearby. Maybe even electric cars no, that would be an imaginative step too far.Perhaps before the A dialling finishes and any other major road project Holyrood might want to take the lead and plan for a bladeless contribution to our power needs.John Davidson, Carnoustie.TORIES RANCID PHILOSOPHYDR RM Morrishits the nail on the head when he characterises the Johnson Government as \"supremely competent\" in pursuing its own narrow interests rather than the interests of all its citizens. Thus the wealthy, oligarchic backers and Brexit-loving xenophobes are appeased by policies and promises that are entirely self-centred and devoid of empathy where the less well-off are concerned.This particular nail would have been obvious to many for some considerable time, but clearly not enough, as the results of the last election show us. Voters should ponder long and hard whether they wish to continue to collude with such a rancid philosophy.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.WE MUST CHANGE THE TAX LAWSAS wein the press re the UK Chancellor’s we avoiding tax , I wonder when we are going to tackle the real issue.The social group that benefits from the current tax laws is the same group that made the tax laws and the business laws that – while intended initially to encourage investment – now just protect business people from the very market forces they are always banging on about. Ditto the same group that made the company laws that saw Sir Philip Green get away with asset-stripping British Home Stores and running up huge pension deficits while buying multi-million-pound yachts for his own pleasure.It was legal. Everyone knows it was wrong but the law protected him.Those same laws mean that those who benefit from government subsidy, post-privatisation of almost everything, are de facto living off massive social handouts – the very sort which is derided when givento poor people.Pinpointing the vile iniduals who have accumulated so much of the world’s wealth while people starve and suffer the effects of climate devastationis no longer a thing.The real thing is, laws need to be updated and made fit for purpose to reflect what actually happens in the st century.Amanda Baker, Edinburgh.WHATS FAIR IS FAIRAMID all the huffing and puffing about Rishi Sunaks Budget and wealth I spotted this on Twitter: \"This fair society thing. I know exactly what it is. Everyone richer than me can pay more in taxes. Preferably a windfall tax too for being richer than me. Everyone whose property is worth more than mine should pay punitive inheritance tax on their death. Everyone who owns a car bigger than mine should pay a much higher road tax. Then my taxes could be lowered and benefits through public services that I personally would use could be raised. That seems fair to me.\"Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.TV TREATS US LIKE CHILDRENI REMEMBER the Vietnam War but have no recollection of TV news reports from the time being prefaced with warnings about distressing content. I’m also pretty sure that in  the BBC didn’t preface Richard Dimbleby’s dispatches from Bergen-Bn with such advisories.Now, however, in the excellent coverage of the Ukraine war, we are endlessly told, as for example in Channel  News on Thursday, five times in  minutes, that \"this report contains distressing images\".We know that these images will be distressing, it’s war, we understand this, we do not need broadcasters treating us like children. For those who don’t want to see reality, they know where the \"off\" switch is.Stuart Neville, Clydebank.WE CANT DECIDE ON PEACENEIL Mackay describes reports of atrocities in Ukraine with Russia as the likely culprit . He writes that evenRussia withdraws from Ukraine \"there can be no peace until both Putin and his regime are destroyed\".So far Ukraine is the only country at war with Russia, not the UK. Commentators from our country cannot decide whether peace terms are acceptable to the countries at war.Allan Mackenzie, Cumbernauld.THE OTHER WH SMITHIAN McConnells article was not just interesting from a business perspective, but also from an educational one. Narrating the le and legacy of John Menzies and the business he founded was very informative.The mention of the takeover by WH Smith in the s reminded me of another WH Smith who has largely been forgotten by history. William Smith opened a foundry in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in  with three men  years later it had grown to a company which employed more than . His \"vision\" was to be able to \"make anything my neighbour might want\".I am not sure when the business closed, but I do know that there are still manholes and drains in Shropshire which bear his name and one of the easiest to find is in the village of Ironbridge near Telford. Behind the village store a drain cover is emblazoned with it.If any of your readers are in the vicinity of Ironbridge, they should go looking for it and be impressed by a piece of social history.I do realise, of course, that I am a bit of a saddo, butits a good enough hobby for Jeremy Corbyn then its good enough for me.Gordon Fisher, Stewarton.LITTER SOLUTION IN OUR OWN HANDSTHE letterfrom George Moore requesting an apology from Glasgow City Council for \"the filthy state of Glasgows litter-strewn pavements\" typies much of what is wrong with todays society. I was reminded of an occasion, years ago, waiting for a train on Queen Street Stations low level . A fellow passenger castigated a railway employee who emerged from an office that the litter-strewn  was a disgrace to which the employee replied : \"I didnt drop the litter there, madam.\"I am sure it is not Glasgow City Council which drops all the litter. A litter-free city, indeed country, lies in our own hands.Bob Byiers, Bearsden.AN OWN GOAL FROM SCOTRAILI AM going to Hampden Park on Tuesday evening to watch the Scotland Women’s National Team play Spain. On checking the train times from Mount Florida after the match, I discover that it is an hourly service. I shall therefore drive to the game, as I am sure many others will do.

For many people, the overall cost of living is simply too high, and incomes are not keeping up.This means having to make dficult choices between – for example – topping up their energy meter and buying that week’s shop.It is dficult decisions like these that culminate in people queuing outside foodbanks.This has been a common story for CAB clients for years.A snapshot of CAB debt management client’s budgets between April  and March  found that more than two in every five did not have enough income to cover their necessary monthly living costs.The maths simply did not add up. For these clients, decisions like the one described above are likely to have been a monthly occurrence.If you have filled your petrol tank recently, received your council tax bill, or submitted a meter reading, you might have noticed that prices are going up. is set to be defined by a very sharp increase in living costs. To top this off, many people have already experienced an income drop - from the £ cut to Universal Credit and end of furlough last Autumn to increases to National Insurance this spring.If the maths didn’t add up in  , things are not set to look any better in  .These factors combined will affect people’s ability to purchase food. Food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe recently demonstrated that current inflation has disproportionately affected low price foods, using the example of pasta in her local supermarket which rose from p to p over the course of a year.Under these metrics, the official estimates of .% inflation don’t come close to reflecting how price rises are actually hitting low income households.The same goes for energy. From the beginning of this month, energy bills will rise by over % -almost ten times the estimated rate of inflation. We are also concerned about housing costs.Social sector rents have been increasing more than twice as fast as inflation. And for some low-income households, private sector rents can be over half of their household income.So, to end the need for foodbanks long-term, we need to make sure that people have enough income to meet ALL their living costs.This means putting more money in people’s pockets and reducing the cost of living so that this money goes further.Our message to anyone worried about the cost of living is to get advice, and we’ll help however we can.However, we also need to see more action from the UK and Scottish Governments to address the rising cost of living. Otherwise foodbanks will be needed for a long time to come.Laura Toffolo is part of the policy team at Citizens Advice Scotland.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Just looking at these images, at the waves thundering around sea stacks, the dizzying clfs, the dark sea caves, is an escape in itself.These are places of desire and longing. Evenwe never reach them, there’s an awe in knowing they exist. Caisteal Abhail, ArranA view from above, of Goatfell, the surrounding Corbetts and the rocky peak of Caisteal Abhail. Peter Irvine describes how Richard Cross captured this image by drone, after a climb from Glen Rosa to the summit of Caisteal Abhail, aka the Sleeping Warrior. \"The Corbetts here,\" he notes, \"Cìr Mhòr, Goatfell and Caisteal Abhail, together with Beinn Tarsuinn , can all be bagged in a twelve-mile ten-hour expedition. You’d want it to be a day like this one.\" Arran, of course, as Irvine observes, is one of the most accessible of the Scottish islands, but for wild, remoteness like this you have to put in a bit of work. Carsaig Arches, MullOne of Mull’s most striking natural phenomena, reached by a four-mile walk from the pier at Carsaig Bay, which is itself five miles off the main A in the southwest of the island. The route is tough and includes very rocky ground, strewn with boulders. \"Carved by erosion,\" Irvine writes, the arches are \"part of a volcanic landscape at times supernatural... As you reach the first arch at the end of the track, descending from the ridge, it looks like an opening into the sea, or ‘into another planet’. Other arches are like tunnels and there are sculpted pillars of basalt.\" Best to visit during low tides, when the arches themselves are more accessible, particularlyyou plan on walking further than the first arch. Fingals Cave, StaffaAn hours boat trip from Mull, on the tiny uninhabited island of Staffa, is a sea cave that has lured countless travellers since it was discovered in . Irvine writes, \"Sir Walter Scott wrote that ‘it exceeded in my mind every description I had ever heard of it’ and the -year-old boy wonder, Mendelssohn was so moved by it when he arrivedin  on the newly introduced paddle steamer service round Mull, that he was inspired to wrote his famed Hebrides Overture. The basalt columns, the huge arched entranceway and the cave’s dimensions –  m deep,  m high – leave a profound impression.\" Boat trips generally allow an hour or two of exploration, and some adventurous swimmers have even braved a dip there. National Geographic photographer Jim Richardson took this shot with added lighting effects, which bring its dark and dramatic architecture to le. The Mangarstadh Sea Stacks, LewisMany come to Uig for the breath-taking white beaches. But this area on the west coast of Lewis, washed by the wild Atlantic, is also an area of such rocky and elemental spectacle that it stirs the soul. \"The drama,\" writes Irvine, \"of the MangarstadhSea Stacks could not be further away from the gentle sandy strand of the same name, though they are only  km further on along the B...You might marvel at the grandeur of these timeless pinnacles, that they are so unknown, or just at the indomitable endurance of Lewisian gneiss.\" This photograph was taken by Michael Stirling-Aird, while on holiday. Irvine also advises that visitors be sure, on the way to visit the stacks, or after, to pop into the \"superlative seafood restaurant with the view to die for\", Uig Sands. Muckle Flugga, Unst A Sheiling, LewisThe sheilings of Lewis are iconic signs of a le that lingered longer here. Effectively summer bothies which were used by people who took their cattle out to the moors in order to preserve the pastures close to the villages for use in the winter months, they are the simplest of dwellings. Its their tin roofs that often stand out in the landscape and seem so distinctive. As Irvine puts it, Mhairi Laws \"photograph of an isolated house over the hill near Acha Mòr reminds us that the Old Ways are still part of the landscape of Lewis visible around the A, which cuts through the island’s heartland. They can seem to merge into the stony land. Sheilings are rough and ready, for animals rather than their keepers, though butter and curd cheese might have been made and shelter taken.\" Clfs of Yesnaby, Orkney\"The red clfs of Yesnaby,\" writes Irvine, \"are to Orkney what the white clfs are to Dover and England. Somehow they’re emblematic folk say, with a wistful sigh, you must at least go there before you leave.\" In this photograph by Ingrid Budge, they glow in the late afternoon sun, the tones of their rock of old red sandstone set on fire. Into this porous stone, the sea has carved blowholes, geos and sea stacks. The clfs can be reached via the West Coast Walk, south of Skara Brae. Climbers are often lured by the challenge of Yesnaby Castle. Neist PointAs far west as you can go on Skye, at the tip of the Duirinish Peninsula is a lighthouse,  metres above the water, that lures walkers towards it, just as it warns boats away. The rocky outcrop juts into the Minch, providing drmatic , as Irvine says, \"from here there are regular sightings of dolphins, porpoises, whales and basking sharks and, of course, seabirds on the clfs.\" Built in  based on a David Stevenson design. \"On the -minute up and down walk, the lighthouse doesn’t come into view immediately, but when it does it’s a stately edice, a worthy destination, as the field of stone cairns built by walkers, attests.\" For the ultimate view, visit at sunset and watch the light dip down in the west. Machair, South UistAs Irvine himself points out, the Machair, of course, is not a place, but a marvellous habitat, one of the rarest in Europe. Its formed by the meeting of low-lying coastline, shell fragments, strong winds, just the right amount of rainfall, and the impact of people and their grazing animals. In these coastal fields, wild flowers mixed with crop grasses like oats and rye. It is also, Irvine notes, home to the great yellow bumblebee and the \"secretive\" corncrake. \"If you are lucky enough to hear the corncrake’s distinctive krek call or see the swallows high in a wide blue sky, and the sea shimmering in the distance as you walk through a rippling field of flowers, and there’s nobody around for miles, you know that…le is good.\" Photograph by Dalziel. Black Cuillin, SkyeSo iconic, it was called simply The Ridge, in the film in which Danny Macaskill tackled it by bike. This is, quite possibly, Britains most dramatic mountain silhouette, and is formed from, notes Irvine, the \"remains of an eroded magma chamber of a giant volcano, its jagged edges sculpted by glacial activity and millennia of weathering\". Its also a challenging mountain climb: eight miles long, with eleven Munros and  other summits. However, though the Cuillin can seem daunting,writes Irvine, \"there are ways of experiencing it without risk or too much effort. Coire Lagan, a five-mile round trip from Glen Brittle, is a beautul mountain loch surrounded by the highest peaks. Also on the four-mile walk around Loch Coruisk , you are in an amphitheatre with one of the world’s most spectacular backdrops.\" Photograph by Richard CrossScotland The Best: The Islands by Peter Irvine is published by CollinsIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraSuspended DUP councillor William Walker in child grooming case has left Northern IrelandMaking waves: £.m coastal property in Portstewart is one in a millionBelfast paedophile brothers Gary and Gregory Rea shocked to be shunned by neighboursTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co.DownPlayVideo: Car overturns on A outside BelfastPlayAnti-protocol rally in Lurgan pleads for #Unionist unity# with #noose# posters of Doug BeattieLatest Northern IrelandBoris Johnson, Micheal Martin and other politicians mark  years since Good Friday AgreementOisin McConville: My guide to the Ulster Championship with Tyrone being the dominant force againCircuit of Ireland chief Nigel Hughes confident new concept will work well over Easter weekendJoe Brolly meets Doug Beattie: ‘To watch a man die at the end of my bayonet has had a huge effect on my mental health’Máiría CahillOpinionIgnore the election slogans, it’s plus ça change for Sinn FéinLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three deaths and  new cases reportedBoris Johnson, Micheal Martin and other politicians mark  years since Good Friday AgreementUkrainian forces dig in ahead of expected Russian onslaughtOisin McConville: My guide to the Ulster Championship with Tyrone being the dominant force againKate Winslet to star opposite her daughter in third series of I Am dramas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

for commission to detoxify trans debate","story":"People take part in a protest over transgender people not being included in plans to ban conversion therapy  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeople take part in a protest over transgender people not being included in plans to ban conversion therapy By Sophie Wingate and Luke O#Reilly, PAApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Prime Minister’s LGBT adviser has said he is “dismayed” by the decision not to include transgender people in a ban on conversion therapy, while describing the cancellation of the Government’s landmark equality conference as an “act of self-harm by the LGBT lobby”.Nick Herbert also called for a royal commission to “detoxy” and take the politics out of the trans debate.It comes after the Government has faced fierce criticism over a series of U-turns last week on promised legislation to outlaw conversion therapy, and its backtracking on commitments to include transgender people in the ban.At least  LGBT+ and HIV organisations pulled out of the UK’s first international conference on LGBT rights, Safe To Be Me, in protest, leading to its cancellation.No-one will win from a culture war on these issues, and those most harmed will be trans people who already feel stigmatisedNick Herbert, PM#s LGBT adviserThe anger has not abated, with hundreds of people protesting against the Government’s decision outside Downing Street on Saturday.Lord Herbert of South Downs, Boris Johnson’s special envoy on LGBT rights, wrote on his website: “The conference’s cancellation is damaging to the Government and to the UK’s global reputation.“But it is also an act of self-harm by the LGBT lobby”.He accused the LGBT+ charity Stonewall of orchestrating the boycott and of shedding “crocodile tears” over the subsequent cancellation.My comment on the Conversion Therapy u-turn, cancellation of the #SafeToBeMe global equality conference, the LGBT lobby, the PM’s comments on trans issues, and why we need a Royal Commission to detoxy the trans debate and find common ground https:t.co lUjOBSbQ— Nick HerbertApril , Lord Herbert, , said: “LGBT groups were understandably dismayed, as was I, when a promised Conversion Therapy ban was suddenly dropped and then only partially reinstated just hours later”.The exclusion of trans people reflected “concern that more time is needed to ensure that legitimate therapies to help young people with gender dysphoria are not inadvertently criminalised,” he said.Such concerns can be allayed, he said, while warning ministers against conflating helping people with “ideology” that can “do irreparable harm”.“We must address the concerns and make the case for change, deploying the evidence and reassuring parliamentarians that a ban which includes trans people is a safe and justiable course to take,” he wrote, while criticising “shouty protests” over the issue.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_e-e-d-bd-cb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_e-e-d-bd-cb_embedded w\"

“biological males” should not compete in women’s sports and that women should have access to single-sex spaces in places such as hospitals and prisons.Calling for a royal commission, Lord Herbert said: “We must not allow a descent into a political mire which is dominated by extremes and which suffocates the reasonable middle ground”.Led by a senior judge and with “truly neutral” members, the inquiry would “examine these issues dispassionately”, he said.“Weighing the evidence on contested areas such as sport, safe spaces for women, and gender identity services for children and young people … would be a better way to detoxy the debate, protect trans people from being caught in the political crossfire, and find the common ground we need.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk

ban, which we will never ever accept.“The only ban worth having is a ban for everyone, including trans people.”Jess, , from Nottingham, told the PA news agency that transgender people’s lives are at risk because of Government policy.“The reason that I am here at the protest today is because Government policy and the transphobic rhetoric we’re seeing around excluding trans people from the conversion therapy ban is a massive threat to trans lives, particularly trans youth, within the UK,” they said.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and fun runs will be staged on Saturday, May , and once again look likely to raise several thousand pounds for charity.In its third year the event has already raised pound, and the organisers are hoping that next monthrsquos event will top the pound total which was raised last year.This yearrsquos beneficiaries will be the Leukaemia Research Fund, the Marie Curie Trust, Beaconsfield, and Lions charities.The event, which is over a proven course and backed by the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletics Federation, has already become established as one of the major events on the athletics calendar and will attract runners from many parts of the province.Once again the run will begin at .pm at the Community Centre in Windmill Street, and part of the route will be through the grounds of the Montalto Estate.Lots of dferent categories have been designated by the Lions and there are prizes on offer for practically everything, from the first k runner home to the best fancy dress team.A new

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday.

There is complaint about lack of infrastructure but that is not so surprising when you consider that it is in fact a small city. Compactness is part of its charm.It has easy access to Donegal and the Antrim coast. Also a road to Belfast that is getting better this very year with the new Dungiven bypass.But Helen’s Bay has a special place in my heart. I grew up on a less fashionable part of the Bangor railway line but had friends who lived in Helen’s Bay, The train station gave me independence from a young age to visit them, and I have been fond of the village since.

Unfortunately this lead to the authorities giving in to their demands, something which is still the case at Drumcree today. I don’t believe that Drumcree is linked to the tragedy of the Quinn children —it was then republicans should take the blame.I’m a member of the Orange Order and I voted for the Good Friday Agreementbecause I accepted the assurances given to David Trimble by London, Dublin and SDLP, assurances which proved to be worthless. How many unionists would’ve voted for the GFAthey had known of the secret deals made between London, Dublin and SF which gave a de facto amnesty to the Provos only  Ever since the GFA was signed all that SF have needed to say, to get their endless demands met, is to say that the GFA is in danger . Every time this has lead London, Dublin, Brussels and Washington giving in to them.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPolicing Minister Kit Malthouse acknowledged the disclosure that Mr Sunak’s we, Akshata Murty, was “non domiciled” in the UK for tax purposes was “not ideal”.However he said the Chancellor was a “smart, clever, committed politician” who had helped steer the economy through the worst of the pandemic.His defence came after it emerged that Mr Sunak had ordered a Whitehall inquiry into who leaked details of Ms Murty’s tax status to the media triggering a furious political outcry. vw,vw,px, px\"Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his we Akshata Murty For Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a matter of “basic fairness” that the Chancellor’s family should pay tax in the same way as everyone  and should not enjoy “special arrangements” to reduce their bills.“I don’t think the Chancellor gets that.“That raises real questions about his judgment,” she told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.Ms Murty, who remains an Indian citizen, dramatically announced on Friday that she would now pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her tax status to be a distraction for her husband.It has been estimated that her non dom status could have saved her £ million in taxes on idends from her shares in Infosys, an Indian IT company founded by her father.Mr Malthouse said it was “not a brilliant time” for the details to come out when the country was struggling with a cost of living crisis, but said she had now “corrected” the situation.With some Tory MPs questioning whether any hopes Mr Sunak harboured of becoming prime minister have been dashed by the disclosures, Mr Malthouse denied that his career was “toast”..remove“Rishi Sunak has been a remarkable force for good in this country over the last two years.“He put in place some incredible support schemes during the pandemic at enormous speed,” he said.Ultimately, however, he said Mr Sunak’s own political future was of “secondary importance” to what happened to the UK economy.“It is not ideal, but we all when we sign up for this job know that there is going to be rough times and smooth times,” he told the BBC.“The key thing is that he remains committed to the job that he is doing which is to steer the British economy and its people through some very, very dficult and challenging moments. vw,vw,px, px\"Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the disclosures raised questions about Mr Sunak’s judgment “What happens to him the future will be of secondary importance to what happens to the country.”There is likely to be relief among Mr Sunak’s allies at the way Mr Malthouse, a longstanding ally of Boris Johnson, spoke out in his support.The Chancellor was reportedly unhappy at the failure of colleagues to come to his defence when the news broke last week.He was already under pressure amid criticism that last month’s spring statement did little for those struggling on low incomes, leading to reports of tensions with No .Meanwhile sources close to Mr Sunak have played down reports that he was moving his we and two daughters out of Downing Street to escape the glare of the media.The Sunday Times reported that removal vans arrived in the street on Saturday to take their belongings away.One source said however they had always intended to spend more time in their west London home as their elder daughter, Krishna, entered her final term of primary school before moving on to secondary school.Mr Sunak is still expected to stay in Downing Street during the week while joining them at weekends..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Rishi Sunak is a  uremarkable force for good u in British politics, says minister article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in . By , its numbers were less than half those recorded in , it came in at  in the rankings this year, seen in just % of gardens.Throughout the first half of the spring term the nation’s school children took part in the RSPB’s Big Schools Birdwatch. The UK-wide survey of birds in school grounds saw amost , school children and their teachers spend an hour in nature counting the birds. Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need.

WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

One of the most successful initiatives we have been involved in has been the local ‘Row on Row’ project, which we run alongside our friends in Dalaradia. The scheme recognises those who perished during the World Wars, sacricing their lives for our freedom.Members of RATH helped to provide festive cheer during the Covid pandemic.“The project provided an opportunity for members of the local community to pay their respects over the last two years, particularly when Royal British Legion Remembrance Services were curtailed during the Coronavirus pandemic.“Rathcoole is the second largest housing estate in Europe and we feel it is a travesty our estate does not have a memorial garden in memory of the great men and women of the World Wars. We hope one can be built in the future.”As well as helping to commemorate Newtownabbey’s veterans and war fallen, members of RATH have been at the forefront of helping to provide a physical outlet for disabled residents.The spokesperson explained: “Another thing which has been successful for us is the establishment of a disability football team, Antrim Newtownabbey Disability FC. It is currently the only such team in the borough, catering for both male and female ambulant players and has around  members ranging in ages from seven to  for the junior sides and  plus for the senior team.Antrim Newtownabbey Disability FC caters for male and female players.“We train on a Wednesday evening and we are always open to welcoming new players, no matter what your ability or playing level is.“When the Irish Football Association Disability League starts back again we hope to be participating in this and other tournaments such as the George Best Community Cup.”Female members of Rath also established the TOM project in a move to tackle sanitary poverty within Rathcoole estate and the surrounding areas. The programme provides free products and advice to those in need.Within a year of the group’s formation, RATH’s  members and associated volunteers found their services in demand due to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, with the community group stepping-up to help support vulnerable residents in the Rathcoole area.Detailimg the impact of the restrictions on the Dunanney Centre group’s activities, the spokesperson added: “During Covid- our group continuously worked through the pandemic collecting prescriptions, delivering food, and making wellbeing packs funded by numerous agencies including Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, as well as a £k investment to our group by Bryson to help people with essestial supplies such as gas, food, electrictricity and brand new white goods and electronic tablets.“We have also helped Rathcoole PS with brand new reading books and stationary to every primary pupil and also provided items to the nursery unit. This was all possible thanks to a Lottery ‘Awards For All’ grant we recieved.”Looking ahead to further successful initiatives, the spokesperson concluded: “Our plans for the next year are to continue to make our estate the best wee place it can and show how great the people of Rathcoole are when we all stick together.”For more information, check out the RATH Community Group Facebook page, Antrim and Newtownabbey Disability FC on social media and the TOM Project on Facebook.----Read More Read MoreEmployment skills boost for Newtownabbey residentsNewtownabbey  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most Popular pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rally...News pictures of young stars on the stage at Portadown Music F...NewsPSNI investigating theft of much-loved working sheepdogs...NewsYoung mum ‘did not intend to stab man in the back at party’...NewsFuel costs: NI’s most expensive and cheapest petrol and dies...NewsMost PopularWeight loss: can a Lumen ‘metabolism reader’ help you lose w...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Hundreds of people young and old filed through the doors all afternoon as the magic ed to Portmagic - and just in time for Easter. The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex.
