I wouldn\u0027t support this deal if the EU were paying us.\u0027    Boris Johnson, pictured left, stunned fellow ministers with a four-letter dismissal of Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan during Friday\u0027s Chequers meeting after Mrs May, right, called for loyaltyToday\u0027s accounts of Friday\u0027s showdown revealed Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson stunned fellow Ministers with his four-letter dismissal of the Prime Minister\u0027s plan at Friday\u0027s special Chequers summit designed to unite the Cabinet. His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/11/4E05CD1600000578-0-image-a-21_1531045041011.jpg","title":"Stunning colourised images bring life bravery British troops 75 years WWII","story":"    During the invasion of Sicily, the Liberty ship Robert Rowan (K-40) has been hit by a German Ju 88 bomber and its cargo of munitions explodes off Gela, Sicily.

The stunning venue has attracted a list guests like Jack Nicholson and Michael DouglasAckergill Tower is believed to date from 1475 and over its 500-year history it was often besieged during feuds between Scottish clans.It was extended in the mid-19th century by Scottish architect David Bryce and was restored in the 1980s to its former grandeur.   Businessman Mike Clare, who founded bed retailer Dreams, bought and converted it in 2009 but he is now selling the impressive property.The property currently operates as a country house hotel but has also been an exclusive wedding, party and conference venue in the past.The five-storey tower is steeped in history but has had 21st century luxuries added and has 32 bedrooms, 31 bathrooms and ten reception rooms including the impressive wood-panelled Great Hall.There is plenty of additional accommodation in the 30 acres of grounds, including the converted stables which sleep ten people and Europe\u0027s largest treehouse, which sleeps two.The treehouse is in a 150-year-old Sycamore tree and has a 7ft round bed and a large circular bath, as well as 360-degree views of the surrounding woodland and a \u0027twilight ceiling\u0027 so guests can gaze up at the stars through the tree\u0027s branches.

The tower has attracted some world famous guests including entrepreneur Richard Bransom, Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas          A treehouse has been built around a 150 year old sycamore tree in the grounds of the luxury tower.

Then the Prime Minister swept in wearing a purple dress trimmed in green. ‘The colour of the suffragettes,’ observed one minister who thought it ‘very significant’ in the 100th anniversary of the first women securing the vote. The topic for discussion was a 120-page document on the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) which most had received only the afternoon before. Questions went back and forth rapidly.Someone asked for clarification of some of the figures and Chancellor Philip Hammond answered. Ten minutes later he was still talking, at which point he was cut off by the PM who chided that it wasn’t the time for speeches.As the temperature steadily rose – there is no air conditioning at Chequers, the weekend retreat of every prime minister since the end of the First World War – most people took off their jackets.Even Britain’s bearded ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow, in his trademark three piece suit, stripped down to his waistcoat.Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...Furious Brexiteer Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence in...Share this articleThen Mrs May asked Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, to speak.‘Oh God,’ said Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. Quick as a flash, the PM retorted: ‘He’ll like that as an introduction.’ Smith’s assessment was crucial to May’s subsequent victory, because he bluntly warned that without the FCA compromise the Government would certainly lose a Commons vote on July 16 and be forced to stay in the Customs Union. His remarks had a sobering effect. They broke for a buffet lunch, on the sun-drenched patio, of barbecue chicken thighs with a selection of salads made using produce from the Chequers estate. For dessert there were scones and cream and sticky tea loaf.Boris Johnson, a Cabinet heavyweight in more ways than one, was seen prodding the loaf with a fork but resisted taking a bite.At 2pm, they reassembled in the Grand Parlour as the thermometer on the wall hit 27.3C. Windows were thrown open and the Chequers team ferried in chilled Diet Coke and elderflower cordial.For those who needed more of a sugar rush, a bag of Haribo sweets also went round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt photographed ing in, although nothing passed his lips apparently. ‘He’s thinking about his public image all the time,’ observed one source drily.The Prime Minister then spoke for six minutes looking down only occasionally at her notes.‘There was a touch of Elizabeth I about her. Haughty, almost regal, she was confident and assured,’ one minister said admiringly.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, went next. A former Europe minister, arch Remainer, and fully paid-up cheerleader for May, he banged the drum for the FCA. No surprise there.    The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove (pictured), who said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work’All eyes, however, were on David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, whom May then called to speak. It was a pivotal moment. Davis had little to do with the FCA, which was drawn up by civil servants who now appear to be leading the negotiations. He made clear he disagreed with the plan and warned the EU would come back for ‘even more concessions’. But it was clear that he would accept the majority view.One senior source said: ‘He is a realist who knows we are leaving the EU albeit not exactly on the terms he wanted, and he also relishes his Cabinet role.’ Boris Johnson appeared surprised to be called next. In a six-minute ‘rant’ or ‘whinge’, depending who you spoke to, he despaired that the customs plan had ‘emerged zombie-like from the coffin’.The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. Stressing that the FCA was not his preferred option and arguing they must make more plans for ‘no deal’, he said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work.’The words had the desired effect. ‘It changed everything,’ said another source.

The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/11/4DF5F8C600000578-5930415-image-a-41_1531044590212.jpg","title":"England fans London think Prince Harry Range Rover driving Putney","story":"Crowds of football fans swarmed a blacked out Range Rover as it drove through Putney, south west London yesterday as they screamed they had spotted Prince Harry inside           Female voices are mistakenly heard shouting the Duke of Sussex\u0027s name (pictured with wife Meghan Markle) and a football chant begins as the driver is forced to come to a standstill          It was actually Simon Cowell (pictured left) with his partner Lauren Silverman (right) and their son Eric (front pictured in Los Angeles) in the black Range Rover in Putney His spokesman said: \u0027The fans were great, it was all very good-natured and a lot of fun.\u0027Simon, Lauren and Eric were on their way home from a children\u0027s birthday party and they thought it was very funny.

The stunning venue has attracted a list guests like Jack Nicholson and Michael DouglasAckergill Tower is believed to date from 1475 and over its 500-year history it was often besieged during feuds between Scottish clans.It was extended in the mid-19th century by Scottish architect David Bryce and was restored in the 1980s to its former grandeur.   Businessman Mike Clare, who founded bed retailer Dreams, bought and converted it in 2009 but he is now selling the impressive property.The property currently operates as a country house hotel but has also been an exclusive wedding, party and conference venue in the past.The five-storey tower is steeped in history but has had 21st century luxuries added and has 32 bedrooms, 31 bathrooms and ten reception rooms including the impressive wood-panelled Great Hall.There is plenty of additional accommodation in the 30 acres of grounds, including the converted stables which sleep ten people and Europe\u0027s largest treehouse, which sleeps two.The treehouse is in a 150-year-old Sycamore tree and has a 7ft round bed and a large circular bath, as well as 360-degree views of the surrounding woodland and a \u0027twilight ceiling\u0027 so guests can gaze up at the stars through the tree\u0027s branches.          Private parties and weddings have been held in the wood panelled dining room. The stunning property is near John O\u0027Groats in Caithness, the most northerly point in Scotland          The tower, complete with a huge tree house and 32 rooms, guest houses and seaside cottages is near John O\u0027Groats in Caithness          The tower has classic, executive and deluxe rooms which guests have been enjoying for decades. The castle itself was built 600 years ago           The striking 15th century Scottish castle stands on the shoreline at Sinclair Bay on the northernmost tip of ScotlandThere is also the Smugglers Inn pub, a beautiful Victorian walled garden, a Bothy and a boathouse.It also has a lease of shooting and fishing rights over a neighbouring 3,000 acres.Michael Jones from Knight Frank said: \u0027It\u0027s a totally unique property, the tower is spectacular in itself and the location is also spectacular right on the sea.\u0027It\u0027s currently running as a hotel but for some wealthy people it would be a great place to have a private residence as well - you could certainly do a fair bit of entertaining.\u0027You could use the main castle as your home and use the other properties on the site as guest accommodation when you need it or as holiday rentals.          The tower has attracted some world famous guests including entrepreneur Richard Bransom, Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas          A treehouse has been built around a 150 year old sycamore tree in the grounds of the luxury tower. The treehouse features a large circular bath, 7ft round bed and use of a microwave and fridge          Fine dining and events have been held at the castle for decades. Weddings and functions are also held at the £3.9m venue            The Ackergill Tower Estate has its own pub called the ‘Smugglers Inn\u0027 which features a log fire and a fully stocked bar for guests to relax in \u0027There\u0027s a whole variety of possible uses and we\u0027ve had a real mix of interest from the commercial sector and private owners.\u0027It looks a long way north, it is at the top of Scotland but there\u0027s an airport nearby and helicopters can land at the castle itself.\u0027It\u0027s got stunning views across the water and it\u0027s a spectacular position on the clifftop.\u0027This is a very rare opportunity. There are one or two Scottish castles that come on the market every year but something in this condition, of this magnitude and location is pretty much a one-off.\u0027I think the last time there were was a property of this calibre on the market was when this was sold ten years ago.\u0027          There is room for ten in the tastefully designed \u0027Smiddy\u0027 with mezzanine level combines traditional architecture with modern equestrian style décor          Ackergill Tower says: \u0027All bedrooms have their own bespoke design and unique character with period details, sumptuous furnishings and all the modern luxuries you need to make the most of your Highland escape\u0027          The tower has numerous bedrooms and self-contained cottages for guests to say in.

The Stables \u0027smiddy\u0027 is a four bedroom Scottish luxury holiday cottage sleeping up to ten people          The lavish tower and surrounding grounds are going on sale for £3.9million. The tower itself has a whopping 32 rooms, but it also has its own pub, ceilidh hall and the impressive treehouse is just one of six self-contained holiday cottages"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/14/4E05618300000578-0-It_didn_t_go_too_well_for_one_man_in_Clapham_Junction_London_who-a-10_1531055187100.jpg","title":"England football heroes enjoy earned day families","story":"Share this articleShare this article   And the Leicester defender joined in the fun on Sunday, tweeting a caption alongside the picture: \u0027Can you ask the neighbours to put the bins out on Monday?

In any event, it could still be rejected by Brussels as being detrimental to the ‘integrity’ of its so-called ‘four single market freedoms’: goods, services, people and capital.Any agreement on a free trade deal for goods could yet see Brussels demanding further concessions from Britain.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 4‘COMMON RULEBOOK’PLEDGE: Britain to have a ‘common rulebook’ for food, farm and manufactured goods, shadowing EU regulations. It would also commit to ‘ongoing harmonisation’ with EU rules.REALITY: The common rulebook effectively means the UK would simply replicate every EU regulation as well as staying up to date with new ones (the process known as ‘ongoing harmonisation’).So if Brussels changed the rules on kettles, then Britain would be expected to follow suit. Critics claim this would hamper the UK’s ability to strike trade deals with other countries such as America, which adopts differing standards on animal welfare, for example.We would be unable to relax or tweak regulations to offer more choice to consumers.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 5THE LAWPLEDGE: Parliament to have the final say on incorporating European rules into UK law - and can reject any they do not like.REALITY: This suggests that MPs would have the power to opt out of any new EU rules they dislike, rather than the rules automatically coming into force as at present.But the Government accepts that not doing so will have ‘consequences’ for market access, security cooperation or the frictionless border – with the EU being able to punish any resistance. This would be a huge disincentive to Parliament to erge from EU rules.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 4    Prime Minister Theresa May leads a meeting with her cabinet at Chequers to discuss BrexitUK SERVICESPLEDGE: Britain will not abide by a ‘common rulebook’ for services, including banking and financing.REALITY: The UK’s world-leading services sector will enjoy ‘regulatory flexibility’. That means it will almost certainly lose its current levels of access to EU markets but companies will be unshackled to strike potentially lucrative agreements around the world.However, the City seems to be relaxed and has broadly welcomed the deal.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 1CUSTOMSPLEDGE: A new Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) will remove the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and EU.REALITY: Designed to help solve the Irish border question, this means that imported goods would be charged a UK-set tariff unless they are to be sent on to the Continent. In these circumstances, the EU tariff would be charged and the money passed to Brussels.This is to maintain a frictionless Irish border but new technology will also be developed to track the movement of goods.Critics – such as Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer who want to stay in a customs union with the EU – say FCA will be an unworkable bureaucratic nightmare that restricts trade growth. Supporters say electronic systems are already used to monitor goods arriving in the UK from outside the EU.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 2Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...A soft Brexit will see an even bigger landslide LABOUR...Share this articleWORLD TRADEPLEDGE: Britain will be able to deliver an independent trade policy, with its own seat at the World Trade Organisation, the ability to set our own tariffs and secure deals with other countries.REALITY: This is clearly intended to placate supporters of Brexit who say that one of the key benefits of quitting the EU is strengthening our links with emerging markets, such as India, South America, China and the rest of the Commonwealth.But if Britain simply aligns its regulations on goods the ability to strike trade deals with the rest of the world, including the US, will be jeopardised.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3FARMS \u0026amp FISHPLEDGE: The UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.REALITY: Britain will be able to strike its own path on farming and the CAP payments system, which Environment Secretary Michael Gove has dismissed as ‘unjust, inefficient and perverse’.Getting back control of our seas should guarantee a greater catch for British trawlermen. At present, around 40 per cent of England’s fishing quota is caught by foreign-owned vessels. Sceptics worry, however, that the EU will demand concessions on this in return for a free trade area in goods.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 1MIGRATIONPLEDGE: Free movement will end, giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country.REALITY: Concern about mass migration was one of the main reasons the public voted for Brexit. One of Mrs May’s red lines, she insists free movement from the EU will finish. But an as yet undefined ‘mobility framework’ mentioned in the Downing Street document appears to pave the way for EU and UK citizens to travel freely for work and study. It says this is ‘similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future’. More details on the future immigration policy are expected in the autumn and this remains unresolved.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3          Concern about mass migration was one of the main reasons the public voted for BrexitUK COURTSPLEDGE: The supremacy of the UK’s courts will be restored and with it British sovereignty.REALITY: Ending the supremacy of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was another of Mrs May’s red lines, but it is unclear how this will work alongside the pledge to follow EU rules on goods, the environment and social policy – meaning the UK will still be a ‘rule-taker’, not a ‘rule-maker’.The document says that UK courts would pay ‘due regard’ to the ECJ’s ruling. Disputes between the UK and EU would be decided using independent arbitration.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 4CASH TO EUPLEDGE: The UK will end ‘vast’ annual payments to EU budget.REALITY: Britain currently pays £10billion a year into Brussels coffers – 11 per cent of the bloc’s budget. This is to be slashed, says the document, ‘releasing funds for domestic priorities’ – in particular the Government’s long-term plan to give the NHS an extra £20billion a year by 2023.But it accepts there will still be ‘appropriate contributions’ to the EU for joint action in specific areas, such as science and innovation. And the UK has already agreed to pay a whopping £39million orce bill to leave the EU.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3NO DEALPLEDGE: Step up preparedness for the ‘full range’ of outcomes that might result from negotiations – including no deal.REALITY: Triggering Article 50, Mrs May insisted that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’. The implication was that she would ditch the negotiations if the EU sought to punish Britain for leaving. Following months of offering concession after concession, few now seriously believe she will walk away from the table – not least the EU’s negotiating team.Nevertheless, in what appears to be a sop to Brexiteers, the document says ‘no deal’ is a possibility and that preparations should be ‘stepped up’. Critics say this is too little, too late – and that more work should have been done months ago.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/20/05D8EB08000003E8-0-image-m-7_1531079878543.jpg","title":"Weakest Thai soccer players extracted caves Adelaide doctor said ready move","story":"    Dr Richard Harris is an anesthetist from Adelaide who went into the cave at the request of Thai authoritiesAn Australian doctor convinced Thai officials to change their rescue plans and first get some of the weakest boys out of the cave where they were trapped, it can be revealed. Cave er and anaesthetist Dr Richard Harris, from Adelaide, ed with the rescue team on Sunday afternoon to check on the 12 boys and their coach.The initial strategy was to extract the strongest boys first because they would have more chance of making it to safety while the others could stay back and build up strength.But that was revised after Dr Harris\u0027 health assessment found some of the weaker boys may not survive if they were left behind, according to Thai media.Four of the 12 trapped boys were brought to safety on Sunday evening. Operations to bring out the other eight and their coach will start this afternoon as ers place fresh oxygen tanks along the exit route. Dr Harris, who was requested by British ers leading the operation, is working alongside the Thai Navy and 18 other Australians in the rescue efforts.The 53-year-old has 30 years of ing experience and has worked on retrieving bodies from caves.He famously found the body of stunt er Agnes Milowka who ran out of air in the Tank Cave near Tantanoola in the south east of South Australia in 2011, The Advertiser reported.David Strike, a e event organiser who has known Dr Harris for more than a decade told Fairfax: \u0027He\u0027s been ing for over 30 years, and readily embraced advances in ing technology to better help him explore and photograph caves in Australia and overseas.\u0027\u0027In the past few years, he\u0027s been involved in cave-ing explorations in Australia, China, Christmas Island and New Zealand. He has an active interest in ing safety and accident investigation.\u0027Quite apart from his own cave exploration experiences, as an anaesthetist and a medical professional who is also involved in retrieval medicine, he has always struck me as a person who is capable of calmly assessing any situation and then acting appropriately.\u0027 The \u0027extremely dangerous\u0027 operation to free the boys, who have been trapped in the cave for 15 days, began on Sunday morning when rescuers decided to act before more monsoon rains flood the caves.            Dr Harris has 30 years of ing experience and will work with the Royal Thai Navy during the operation.

It calls for an overhaul of crippling business rates and town centre rules, including parking restrictions, to help struggling traditional retailers compete with online giants.Mr Berry said business rates were a matter for Chancellor Philip Hammond but called on councils to do their part by allowing shoppers to park for free.Car buyers are borrowing more than £100million per day to...Philip Hammond\u0027s snub to the high street: Chancellor refuses...Share this articleMany businesses did not want all-day free parking but would welcome shorter-periods that encouraged a steady flow of shoppers, he added.\u0027Having short periods of free parking is something that can bring people back into high streets,\u0027 the minister told The Daily Telegraph. \u0027Parking should be locally determined. But what I think may be what is missing is the voice of business in parking.\u0027I know in my own local authority we had a situation where you can park all day for free – you would think that is what shopkeepers want.\u0027Guess what? It\u0027s not – they want you to be able to park for an hour or two hours for free because they want you to leave and new customers with fresh money in their pocket to arrive. Having shorter periods of free parking is something that all local authorities, in consultation with their businesses, should consider.\u0027          The suggestion came after the Mail launched a campaign last week to save Britain\u0027s High Street (stock image)Mr Berry also suggested councils should appoint \u0027sheriffs\u0027 whose jobs would be to help make sure the high streets thrived. And he said attractions for visitors to enjoy while they were in town centres could woo more shoppers to struggling stores.He added: \u0027If political leadership knew that shops and businesses were struggling to have their voice heard they would want to do something about it.\u0027We should be working with local authorities at finding ways bringing things like gyms, childcare maybe even day care for the elderly on to the High Street.\u0027Speaking about the High Street in Ashford, Kent, he said: \u0027There are art galleries. There is a bandstand ... I don\u0027t think bandstands are the only solution but I want more things that will bring people into the centre.\u0027Tough conditions on Britain\u0027s high streets have cost around 50,000 retail jobs since the start of the year. Bricks and mortar businesses complain part of the problem is an unfair advantage enjoyed by web giants such as Amazon, which do not have to pay expensive business rates on physical shops, relying instead on huge out-of-town warehouses.Launched last Monday, the Mail\u0027s Save our High Streets campaign calls on the Government to reform business rates and has already received the backing of a string of major stores.Mr Berry said shoppers also had a duty to support retailers. He added: \u0027It is absolutely incumbent on all of us to go out and support the High Street. There is nothing greater than the great British High Street. It is a huge community asset for our nation.\u0027Yesterday the idea was backed by the British Retail Consortium but the group said changes to business rates were also crucial.A spokesman said: \u0027With high street stores under enormous pressure it\u0027s sensible for the Government to look at every measure which could increase footfall.\u0027Free, or at least more affordable, parking could make a real difference in encouraging more consumers into town centres.\u0027However, these initiatives alone aren\u0027t enough – if the Government is serious about helping struggling shops they need to commit to a two-year freeze on business rates.\u0027Only by reducing the significant costs currently facing retailers who operate from property can Government make a real difference to help preserve as many shops as possible.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/23/4E0AAF2300000578-0-image-m-5_1531089672399.jpg","title":"Four 10 voters believe Theresa Mays Chequers deal betrayal Brexit","story":"    Nearly four in ten voters believe Theresa May’s Chequers deal is a betrayal of the referendum amid a hostile reaction from the Tory party faithful, it was revealed last nightBut the Prime Minister has seen a rise in support for her taking her party into the next election, due in 2022.Some 34 per cent thought she should keep hold of the reigns, 24 per cent said she should resign now, while 24 per cent said she should step down after Britain formally leaves the EU in March next year.\u0027They\u0027ll take what we offer and demand more\u0027: David Davis...Jacob Rees-Mogg cheers on David Davis\u0027 sensational...Share this article    An opinion poll found that 35 per cent believe the Brexit compromise agreed by the Cabinet is the best deal Britain will get from the EU, while 38 per cent dismissed it as a sell-outA separate online poll of Tory members by the Conservative Home website revealed widespread unhappiness with the Chequers plan amongst the party faithful.Some 61 per cent of the 1,225 respondents said that that proposal would be a bad deal for Britain, compared to 31 per cent who thought it would be good. A further eight per cent were unsure. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/17/10/4D347B5300000578-0-image-a-6_1529227671152.jpg","title":"Britains heatwave longest FIVE years 82F heat continues","story":"    The Howardian Hills of North Yorkshire are pictured in purple with the lavender fields in full blossom on Sunday          Boats are pictured racing around The Needles on the Isle of Wight as temperatures of 90F bring blue skies and sunshine on Sunday          Dustbowl: Wayoh Reservoir looks more like a desert now as Britain sizzles in a scorching heatwave that has seen very little rainfall in the past three weeks           Britain\u0027s sweltering heatwave is now the longest in five years with temperatures of 82F expected today, with temperatures dropping through the weekThere has been no rain in the region for three weeks - causing reservoir levels to drop dramatically, with Wayoh Reservoir which supplies 200,000 people in Bolton reduced to a trickle.A hosepipe ban, which is already in force in Northern Ireland, would stop people watering their gardens as well using sprinklers, cleaning cars and filling garden ponds and paddling pools.The nation’s water companies are struggling to meet demand as reservoirs dry up - with low water pressure leaving some customers reliant on bottled water.Cameras catch hundreds of drivers on their phones eating,...Will my son be next?

The work under discussion was Angela Carter’s collection of short stories The Bloody Chamber, published in 1979. Aware that I might be called on to demonstrate detailed recall of the book and – frankly, who isn’t? – short of time, I decided to augment my re-reading by plugging into the audio version on a long car journey.It was a revelation, and particularly when it came to the toothsomely creepy title story, read by the actor Emilia Fox. For those unfamiliar with the piece, it retells the fairytale of the wife murderer Bluebeard, and repositions the latest young bride’s mother as her saviour a new version saturated in rich, decadent imagery and vocabulary. The groom’s wedding gift, for example, is a “choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat” on their first night together, “He stripped me, gourmand that he was, as if he were stripping the leaves off an artichoke”.Four novels and five short story collections, narrated by Stephen Fry.

(Pan Macmillan)Rosamund Pike takes the microphone for this spirited performance of Austen’s classic. (Audible Studios)This is beautiful on the page, but listening to Fox savour the words, conjuring perfectly the narrator’s ambiguous blend of trepidation and desire, added another dimension. It did not dilute my reading experience, but rather enriched it.I am not a natural listener to audiobooks, which has little to do with the format itself, and everything to do with my addiction to staring at pages filled with words. Along with the many excellent reasons to spend my life reading whatever I can get my hands on, it is an act of self-definition: reading is simply what I do – balm, stimulation, education, dispeller of boredom and anxiety, wormhole to other worlds beyond my own.The effects on the publishing world are striking. Rachel Mallender, group audio director at HarperCollins, worked for two decades at BBC Radio before joining the company last year. HarperCollins, she tells me, has a “total audio policy” – every book that has a narrative structure will have an audio version, and the aim is to reach as broad a range of audiences in as many ways as possible – from single-narrator books such as Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, read by award-winning audio reader Cathleen McCarron, to Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke’s Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible, which features clips of many of the women and girls they interviewed.“Because the format is growing,” Mallender says, “there’s so many things you can try”. She points towards one of HarperCollins’ recent initiatives, StoryCastle, which delivers free audio content for children on a daily basis via Google Assistant. Voice-activated technology, she believes, will be another driver of innovation.The sector has come a long way since multiple cassettes and their perilous tendency to unspool at just the wrong moment now, Google Player, Apple, Audible and Kobo are all competing for a share of this increasingly buoyant market.But if sales are measurable – even allowing for the fact that Audible, the audiobook retailer now part of the Amazon empire, doesn’t disclose its sales – the effect that the rising popularity of the format will have on our relationship to books and narrative is trickier to gauge. Some observations seem to proceed from common sense: short stories work very well, because you can listen to them in one hit, which is why publications such as the New Yorker have committed themselves to a podcast series of writers reading their own work. It is not rocket science for me to know why I recently ironed a whole batch of laundry while listening to Gary Shteyngart read “The Luck of Kokura”, an acerbically funny story about a financier on the run nor why I am having little luck with my bedtime attempts to make headway with Proust. Thus far, I doze off before Swann has even made an appearance.Similarly, it’s no surprise that people like listening to David Sedaris. Or that they find an overcrowded train the perfect space in which to fill their ears with tales of murder and revenge. Or learn how to tidy their closets effectively. All of which is, of course, easily aided by the dominance of the smartphone.But beyond time and tech, what else? Well, luckily there’s research, courtesy of the University of London (commissioned, we should note, by Audible itself). The study alighted on eight texts, which were then grouped according to four genres: Pride and Prejudice and Great Expectations (classic novels) The Girl on the Train and The Da Vinci Code (action) the Sherlock Holmes story A Study in Scarlet and The Silence of the Lambs (crime) and Alien and A Game of Thrones (science fiction and fantasy). The key was that all the narratives existed in both audio and video versions that were as similar as possible. From each one, the researchers chose an emotionally charged scene – for example, the moment that Arya Stark sees her father being beheaded in Game of Thrones – and the guinea pigs were each fitted with a wrist sensor that measured their heart rate, electrodermal activity and body temperature. Their hearts beat faster and they grew hotter when they listened to each scene rather than watched it.The conclusions drawn are preliminary, but are perhaps explained by the idea that listening, as opposed to watching, requires you to imagine the events and people described. Additionally, hearing words leaves a gap for semantic ambiguity that might be more easily resolved by the visual image. The increase in electrodermal activity might well point toward a greater emotional arousal.The study doesn’t compare reading with listening, but the surge in audio popularity does pose questions about the nature – and the future – of how we interact with narratives. If listening, as research seems to show, implies a greater act of co-creation than watching, what does that tell us about reading, long held to be the medium that requires the most total absorption? And what does it tell us about what many believe is the long-term decline of the book industry?One answer is obvious: reading even a short book involves a significant investment of dedicated time, and precludes any other activity. You can’t drive, cook or garden while you’re reading. Reading is a solitary occupation, in a way that watching isn’t and despite the fact that so much of our viewing is now on demand rather than driven by TV schedules, the medium still lends itself more readily to becoming conversational currency and to sharing opinions. In an age of democratic narcissism – not the idea that everyone is entitled to an opinion, but that everyone must express it, repeatedly – that matters.Andy Miller, the author of The Year of Reading Dangerously and the co-founder, with publisher John Mitchinson, of the Backlisted podcast, sees audio as a valuable addition: “The fact that technology now allows you to carry round an unabridged book on your phone. A couple of years ago we were preparing an episode of the podcast on Jane Gardam’s A Long Way From Verona and I was casting around for another, later Gardam book to read too. Kit de Waal, who had been a guest, said, ‘Oh, you should get the audiobook of Bill Wallis reading Old Filth, it’s fantastic.’ And she was right. I could walk the dog or get tea ready and still be reading a brilliant novel, or have one read to me brilliantly, or both at the same time. I loved that book and I loved that way of reading it. So I’m a recent convert, just like lots of people.”Does he worry that audio provides too different an experience to reading itself? “Clearly on audio you are at the mercy of the reader’s skills,” he says. “But then, ego aside, the same is true of reading a book on the page. We’re all at the mercy of our own skills and tastes, aren’t we? But on audio you are hostage to someone else’s interpretation. And on a more basic level, you might simply dislike the voice of the reader. But at its best audio offers a complementary or overlapping experience to the actual book. For example Alex Jennings’s readings of the Patrick Melrose novels by Edward St Aubyn are sublime, a sustained performance that also allows the prose to breathe in its own right. And really funny. They are probably my favourites, along with Juliet Stevenson’s Virginia Woolf readings.”We are living through an era of enchantment with the possibilities of new formats and new technologies, and that enchantment affects creators just as much as it does consumers. Witness Audible’s series of original short story collections, Bard, Jali and Skald, for which acclaimed writers including Sarah Hall, Ben Okri and Adam Thirlwell have produced work designed only for audio. Commissioned by Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, Bard, Jali and Skald are named with ancient storytellers in mind, thereby creating a link to historical oral cultures and yet they also represent the popular contemporary genres of crime and science fiction. The message, clearly, is that there is nothing new under the sun.For those committed to the written word, there is a temptation to see innovation as a threat, to worry that the book will not withstand the bells and whistles of new and augmented texts. Will a burst of music or a celebrity narrator prove the fatal flourish that distracts us forever from the page in front of us?Better to focus on what we might gain. As someone who frequently interviews authors on stage, I’m aware of the unique insight to a text produced by hearing someone read their own work I’ve frequently re-interpreted a passage after such an experience. But that has had no impact on whether or not I’ll read a book by a writer I will never hear reading.One of the writers I met in that context was Don DeLillo, who was making a rare public appearance when his last novel, Zero K, was published. In response to a question about the process of writing, he remarked that he sometimes became entranced by the shape of particular letters, by the way inidual words materialised before him, their aesthetics beyond meaning and the relationship to meaning. For an instant, he sounded implausibly hippy-dippy and then, suddenly, it made perfect sense. Reading does start with shapes, which slowly resolve to make a certain meaning, filtered through our own subjectivity and our senses. That will never change •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d1dce875f8db2a7e554893b71b0e4aebdfe2ba/155_0_4589_2755/master/4589.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=424051591bfe6cbc3588326ef04624f1","title":"elsewhere home leila aboulela review","story":"An unassuaged homesickness has been a theme of Leila Aboulela’s fiction ever since the Sudanese-Egyptian moved to Aberdeen from Khartoum and began writing. Her feted debut novel, The Translator (1999), featured a Sudanese widow in Scotland grieving for her husband and her homeland, while Minaret (2005), saw a Sudanese woman culturally adrift in London.A yearning for home tugs at the souls of Aboulela’s characters in this beautiful and desolate collection of 13 short stories, which brings together her earliest fiction from the 1990s to her latest. They distil many of her recurring concerns – immigrant loneliness, complicated romance and a portrayal of the Islamic faith that goes far beyond the cliched narrative – but without ever becoming trite. Faith, in fact, holds a precious place in the lives of her characters, who feel lost when they cannot pray or forget to do so because of the absence of the azaan (the call to prayer) in the west. Islam is never a dogma but a deeply felt urge.An intimacy is created between couples, siblings, mothers and daughters that immediately pulls the reader into their lives. Friction between east and west, Islam and secularism, is channelled through these relationships. In Summer Maze, an Egyptian-born young woman living in London thinks back to a time when she was more straightforwardly Egyptian and able to speak her mother Lateefa’s tongue. Now, though, “it was as if Lateefa’s values were a subtle, throttled part of her”.In The Museum, which won the Caine prize for African writing in 2000, a couple are on a first date. She is a privileged overseas Sudanese student in Scotland he is a geeky, working-class Scot with a crush on her. “Do ye get homesick?” he asks, and she replies that she yearns for things she didn’t think she would miss, such as the azaan. He looks at her with wonder and says: “We did Islam in school.”The moment captures what it means to be one of Aboulela’s Muslim women in the west visibly different, culturally marooned and craving an emotional connection.Occasionally she gets inside the minds of men too. Something Old, Something New is told from the perspective of a white Muslim convert from Edinburgh, visiting his\u0026nbspSudanese fiancee in Khartoum for the first time. Once there, his desire for her becomes entangled with his suspicions of the “foreigners” in whose land he now feels stranded. Being driven from the airport to his hotel, he thinks: “Any one of these passersby could easily punch him through the window, yank off his watch, his sunglasses, snatch his wallet from the pocket of his shirt.”Mixed-race couples emerge time and again but there is rarely a happy fusion of cultural identities. Fissures occur between Muslim couples too: a desperately homesick wife who leaves Sudan to be with her husband in London is told by him: “If you cover your hair in London they’ll think I’m forcing you to do that.” Remembering the freer woman she was, she thinks: “So\u0026nbspI must walk unclothed, imagining cotton on my hair, lifting my hand to adjust an imaginary tobe.”Pages of Fruit features a traditional housewife who becomes an ardent fan of a Muslim novelist she has never met, but whom she regards as an iconoclast. She saves up for a trip to the Edinburgh book\u0026nbspfestival in the hope of meeting\u0026nbspher, sure that they will feel a sisterly affinity, but is harshly rejected. Aboulela builds up the emotional drama here with such mastery that the rebuff feels like a tragedy, though\u0026nbspthe housewife’s life is outwardly unchanged.There is so much quiet brilliance to this story and others that it is a surprise for those who have only followed Aboulela’s long-form fiction to discover she has just as much mastery of the short form.• Elsewhere, Home by Leila Aboulela is published by Telegram (£8.99).

Oppenheim, who was then only 23, was wearing a brass cuff covered in ocelot fur that she had designed for the Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, and when Picasso noticed it, he was moved to remark teasingly that all sorts of things could surely be wrapped in fur. Oppenheim agreed: even this plate and cup, she offered, gesturing at the contents of her table. Soon after this encounter, she duly swathed a cup, saucer and spoon in the skin of a Chinese gazelle, a curiosity she titled Objet. Witty, erotic and subtly political – in the artistic circles in which Oppenheim moved, women were at best regarded only as muses – it was acquired, before the year was out, by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the first surrealist piece to join its collection.Oppenheim, brilliant and beautiful, has only a tiny walk-on part in Sue Roe’s In Montparnasse: The Emergence of Surrealism in Paris, from Duchamp to Dalí. By the time she appears, hell bent on repurposing the everyday the better to “hound the mad beast of function”, the movement has long since moved from the artistic fringes to the fashionable mainstream, a place where it will stay, in one form or another, for the rest of the century and beyond. Dalí has already painted The Persistence of Memory (1931), in which huge watches, stranded in a desert-like landscape, appear to melt like the wheels of camembert that inspired them he has also made his Lobster Telephone (1936), an object commissioned by the English poet and collector Edward James, as a response to what the artist said of New York in a magazine (“I do not understand why, when I ask for a grilled lobster in a restaurant, I am never served a cooked telephone”).These pieces may still, of course, have unsettled those seeing them for the first time even now, Objet still turns the mind from lapsang souchong to sex in less time than it takes to boil a kettle. But the impulses that led to their creation were radically different to those involved in early surrealism. Here, the unconscious is deployed in, as Roe puts it, a highly strategic manner it is not, as in the work of, say, Max Ernst, a thing bubbling up, unbidden and ungovernable. More significantly, this work, having been made by younger artists, is entirely detached from the impact of the first world war, surrealism’s single most important impetus.Roe carefully lists the experiences of surrealism’s key figures in that war: the poet Guillaume Apollinaire was, for instance, wounded in action his head, still bandaged, was just about the only thing to soften the hearts of the disgusted crowd when Diaghilev’s radical ballet Parade was finally staged in 1917 (written by Jean Cocteau, with designs by Picasso and music by Eric Satie Apollinaire had written the programme notes, and could therefore be seen on the night in the audience). The poet Louis Aragon, who worked as a medic, was buried three times in one day by grenade explosions André Breton, the writer who would give Objet its alternative title, Le Déjeuner en Fourrure, worked as an orderly among the shell-shocked Cocteau was an ambulance driver. But such biographical details apart, Roe never quite takes the time fully to examine the relationship between their horror and consequent rage and their work to show how, as Robert Hughes noted in The Shock of the New, what they had witnessed effectively separated them, by choice or not, from the social order (hence their powerful need for the Montparnasse cafes – Les Deux Magots, the Cafe de la Rotonde, La Closerie des Lilas – that became, in effect, their meeting places, their libraries, their bustling “theatres of the new”).But then, Roe is not in the business of pausing for thought. Like her previous book, In Montmartre, this is a ceaselessly forward-moving narrative – she tells and tells and tells – and while highly colourful, it’s sometimes wearying to read. An almost month-by-month account of the activities of a quite large group of artists, most of whom worked in Montparnasse from 1910-11, they themselves are only sketchily drawn, arriving on the page without much context. Roe’s attention is, rather, on the exhibitions they stage, the manifestos they write, the people they sleep with, and the terrible rows they have – and the effect is oddly flattening. It’s as if you’re at a long and glamorous party, but are allowed to spend only a few minutes at a time with each guest. Meet Man Ray! she says, excitedly. But no sooner have you shaken the great photographer’s hand than she’s urging Marcel Duchamp on you. After a while, you start to sympathise with Kiki de Montparnasse, the artist’s model who would spend most of the 1920s with Man Ray, and who struggled to tell the difference between the various factions, whether dadaist or\u0026nbspsurrealist.Still, they’re all here, the big names of the time – behaving badly and, at times, quite madly, too. At Max Ernst’s first Paris exhibition in 1921, Breton spent the evening making bestial noises, Aragon pretended to be a kangaroo, and Tristan Tzara could be seen playing hide and seek (Tzara was the Romanian poet who founded dada – the word means baby talk in German – at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich). Later, Ernst would become involved in a tortuous love triangle with the poet Paul Éluard and his wife Gala, the same Gala who would eventually leave them both for Dalí the start of this relationship was, Dalí noted in his memoirs, marked by “a permanent character of diseased abnormality”, by which he meant a shared passion for certain sexual kinks. Surrealism, according to Breton, was “a cry of the mind”. But it also had to do with freedom: sometimes, one’s loins cried out, too. Desire evoked melancholia and disorder, that suspension of logic to which, Roe notes, all surrealist thinking aspired. “Love is a state of confusion between the real and the marvellous,” as Aragon put it.Roe’s restive narrative, then, does at least reflect the wildly spinning, agitated lives of its subjects. On and on they go with their bicycle wheels and their unmade beds, their collages and their unrequited love affairs. No wonder that Breton was so disappointed when he met the elderly Sigmund Freud in Vienna three years after the end of the war. The good professor, it seemed, did not after all believe that his kind of psychiatry was just another form of artistic expression. As he would put it afterwards, the “little old man” simply had “no style”.• In Montparnasse: The Emergence of Surrealism in Paris, from Duchamp to Dali by Sue Roe is published by Fig Tree (£20).

But many now fear the city’s regeneration threatens their traditional way of lifeby Karin Goodwin and  Chris LeslieFamilies living in Glasgow’s carnival yards can trace their heritage back hundreds of years. But many now fear the city’s regeneration threatens their traditional way of lifeby Karin Goodwin and  Chris LeslieOn Water Row, sandwiched between Glasgow’s former shipyards and the dark waters of the River Clyde, it would be easy to miss the showpeople’s yards.Look closely and you’ll see a carved dancing bear, chained to an old telegraph pole, or behind high metal railings the folded-up fairground rides waiting repair – tantalising snatches of “the shows”.But now some are saying the pace of 21st-century development is pushing them out of the city.Their concerns are focused around Govan, where regeneration plans are threatening two large extended families. Glasgow city council claims that proposals for Water Row will bring new housing, jobs, businesses and leisure facilities to the community, which undoubtedly needs investment.To some, however, the proposals are hard to stomach as they will mean eviction. Teresa Johnstone was born on Water Row into the Wilmot family, a well-known family of Scottish showpeople. She married and raised her sons here, and has lived on this neat and tidy site for 29 years, paying rent and council tax. Now a £17m development is planned for the site of her home, so she will be relocated.The council says it has been “in regular dialogue with the representatives of the families, offering the full support of the council to move to alternative and fully serviced sites in the local area and beyond”. Johnstone, however, says her family only found out days before the public announcement. It took months to get anything in writing, and though a potential relocation site has now been suggested, there is still no firm solution on the table.Jimmy Stringfellow, who lives in the next yard along with his wife, Diane, their son and grandchildren, is also on tenterhooks. He is currently challenging an eviction notice he was served this year.“It feels like a game of ping pong,” he says of the communication with officials over relocation. “And I can tell you it doesn’t half pong. We’re an endangered species but there is more protection for butterflies and crocodiles than there is for us. It feels like they don’t want us. We are being shoved out of the way and into corners.”Showpeople offer an important service, she says, providing entertainment at galas, fair holidays, fetes, festivals and firework displays, and that should be recognised.“We are governed by the Showman’s Guild – we can’t just pull into derelict land, we’d get fined,” says Johnstone. “We pay council tax, we are regulated. And yet we are getting treated like second-class citizens. We should have equality.”Follow the winding River Clyde a few miles east and you’ll get to Cuningar Loop, a gated site where rows of chalets with neat front gardens house around 100 people. Yard owner Norman Thomas claims the Govan situation has left people rattled. Thomas bought this land, next to a filled-in rubbish dump, 28 years ago. He worries that he doesn’t ultimately control it – a few years ago, South Lanarkshire council tried to move these showpeople to a new site. The plan was only abandoned due to rising costs. Fresh in Thomas’ memory, too, is a relocation programme prior to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, when 22 yards in South Dalmarnock home to some 600 people, were earmarked for redevelopment.After much consultation only 75 chalets were affected. The regeneration partnership, known as Clyde Gateway, says it is proud of the way it managed the programme to “ensure that every family or business affected would have options” for being rehoused. It developed two new yards and invested in improvements to existing sites. Next to the site, Clyde Gateway has developed a popular woodland park, and recently the British Geological Survey put in planning permission for a geo-thermal research site. Both organisations are at pains to explain how carefully they have consulted with the community, but trust isn’t won easily here.“We were brought up to be proud that we are from an entrepreneurial background that goes back for generations, and that we are all very community focused,” says Thomas’ son Royce, who returned here with his husband after studying at university in London. “But there is stigma. So when we hear about what’s happening in Govan yes, we do worry.”The community feels its entire way of life is under threat. In a wagon at the bottom of the site, Preston Irvin is painstakingly airbrushing a children’s ride. He loves this life, but says it is far from easy. There are ever-stricter licensing regulations and soaring costs fairs are shorter and competition for punters fierce. In the winter, he takes on other jobs to help him survive until the season starts again.“Years ago it was different,” he says. “I don’t want to give up this way of life but it is getting harder and harder.” He, too, fears for the future. “You’re think you’re settled. Maybe that could change. And not everyone is happy to have a fairground way of life on their doorstep.”A short drive away in Parkhead lives illustrator and researcher Mitch Miller. There are no development plans for his small, traditional site either, but Miller knows it is a precarious way of life. “What’s happening in Govan can happen anywhere.”He moved back several years ago after living in a Glasgow tenement, where he missed the community. He father, who still runs hook-a-duck stalls and other sideshows, likes to tell stories of acrobat ancestors, boxing grandmothers and trick riding aunties.Miller is one of a small group of campaigners who have written to local politicians with their concerns about the lack of due process in Govan. He hopes a solution will help others fare better in the face of future development.“We are not asking for the moon but for the procedure to be followed,” he says. “Those families have a claim to be there. They put a community in when there was nothing else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c108f0cf7e4776569dd51b33b7d2dfe9cf1f21c0/0_250_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a548c29c901096bb03c5fce7a2e5020","title":"england world cup glory patriotism gareth southgate","story":"Thanks to the heroics of Gareth Southgate’s young side, we’re bonding as a nation. But don’t read too much into the momentThe first World Cup I was old enough to enjoy was Italia 90. My father managed to find a barely functioning printer in his office, printed out a faded copy of the fixtures on flimsy paper and sat at the dining table, highlighting all the matches that he wanted to see. He quickly lost track of what was happening when and asked me to take over. Once I had worked out the time difference between Italy and Sudan, I was hooked, and my World Cup admin job grew and grew. Each day I updated the sheet, faithfully writing down which teams had qualified and who they would play in the next round. I counted the number of goals per striker, and even the yellow and red cards for each team and player.The faded fixture list became a sacred text, though one that was falling apart and smeared with food and thumbprints. The World Cup became a bonding ritual of our relationship every four years. We supported teams on completely arbitrary and random grounds, as we had no national or rational connection to them. When people asked my father why he cared so much, even though he was not particularly interested in football, he would say: “This isn’t football. This is the World Cup.”That was the way I was taught to watch the footballing carnival that is gripping our nation – by a man who had no skin in the game, just a passion for the competition and what it represented. But when you do have a team and a country to support, it can feel like a supreme moment of collective bonding.I’ve watched England matches with strangers on the street through the windows of a closed betting shop where staff had left a television screen on before going home. I have stood on chairs in pubs so packed it was impossible to get a good view. This glorious World Cup in a baking hot summer has been a festival of togetherness. For the quarter-final against Sweden, my local pub was packed with faces from the neighbourhood. People with whom I had only exchanged the occasional hello became, in the World Cup calculus, family for the day.And England won! The team is, amazingly, in the semi-finals and we get to extend our group hug moment for a little while longer. Just one note of caution, though: let’s not try to draw from this moment of sporting pride a lesson about Where We Stand As a Nation.In England we tend to overindulge in another national obsession alongside football – the neurotic attempt to get to the bottom of what it means to be English. Any major national event – and especially a World Cup – is vulnerable to scrutiny through this lens. Nigel Farage’s patriotic posturing has been justly hammered on social media. Others have argued that the team, including as it does a significant number of black or mixed-race players, is acting as a showcase for a erse Britain. But they aren’t really reading the room either. It’s great that this should be so, and it’s a point, but it’s not the point. Events such as the World Cup create an energy that cannot be replicated, created or destroyed, no matter how hard one tries. Healthy patriotism cannot be confected. In its spontaneous forms it is to be welcomed, but the moment always passes.When our politicians are fresh out of ideas at best, or behaving like mendacious cynics at worst, and Brexit has instilled a nervous insecurity about nationalism, it’s tempting to try to read something into how the country is being galvanised by this team. It’s tempting to look at Gareth Southgate and remember for a fleeting, painful moment what it feels like to admire someone in a leadership position to look at the young (so young!), eager faces of the England players and hope that their skill and swagger signifies some sort of renewal of a confident vision of the country.But we have been here before. The London 2012 Olympics felt like a turning point, one during which the country had finally managed to come up with a vibrant, modern and tolerant version of itself. Remember how the opening ceremony celebrated the first wave of Commonwealth immigrants from the Caribbean as they marched behind a huge model of their ship, the Empire Windrush? Remember Mo Farah, athletics hero of a erse nation? But the 2012 glow faded and some of those Windrush immigrants became victims of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policy.Let’s just enjoy the football and England’s progress for its own sake. We should just be grateful for this glorious summer hiatus and enjoy the gifts of an event that allows us momentarily to talk to strangers. To paraphrase my father, it’s not politics, it’s the World Cup, and it’s become an amazing ride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7502de66f2189e64f83bb86884b3e9be47d880/0_138_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859aebc3151d7ce03d6e3558f2595469","title":"the guardian view on forcible integration in denmark this cannot end well","story":"The government sees the problem of ghettos as one\u0026nbspof “parallel societies” – 56 named and defined areas where both the written and unwritten rules that\u0026nbspbind the rest of the country do not hold.

But to make such crimes as vandalism, burglary, threatening behaviour, arson and offences against the drug laws punishable by twice the sentences when committed within the designated ghettos is just grotesque.It is easy to see that this will in practice work as an incentive to criminals from those areas to pursue their criminal employment elsewhere.

One moment you’re the French teenage striking sensation Kylian Mbappé showing the entire Argentina backline a clean pair of jet-heels, en route to eliminating them from the World Cup. The next, you’re the 35-year-old converted holding midfielder Kylian Mbappé, showing the physio a calloused pair of plantar fasciitis-riddled heels (look it up, I did), wondering if you were ever as fast as time itself? No matter who you are and what you do, we are all heading to that point in our lives when all we want to do is just have a little sit.As a comedian, looking at the three shows I have prepped for this year’s Edinburgh festival, comparing them with my previous sets, it’s pretty clear that I have “adapted my game”, picking and choosing my moments to “surge forward”, so that I can at the very least “see out” the Edinburgh fringe clock. Have I still got it in me? Am I ageing gracefully or am I on the brink of becoming a laughing stock (which I’ll still take, by the way)?.I’m sure I speak for most performers of a certain generation when I say the first time I ever got a sense of a comedian’s mortality was while watching an episode of Noel’s House Party back in 1994. A knock on Noel’s door had brought Bob Monkhouse to the live bear pit that was Crinkley Bottom. He was playing Noel Edmonds’ neighbour and had come round to invite Noel to a game of tennis. How did I know this? Bob was wearing tennis whites. Tennis whites and tights. Mahogany-brown tights to match his mahogany-brown face.You see Bob’s legs were white. Egg white. Just like the rest of Bob’s bod before the makeup chair had given his Monkhouse the full lick. I mean fair enough, Bob was 66. Yet still his myth needed to be sold. Fast forward to my career – never one to challenge Bob’s in the tanned or the well-respected stakes – and I have started to feel Bob’s pain. The pain of growing old.When I first started performing live, it was all about the energy, the speed, the frenzy. I liked to make an hour whizz by like a bullet train riding another bullet train. I didn’t want to give anyone time to scrutinise what the hell they’d just witnessed in case they noticed how pencil-thin the whole thing was. I had a sketch where I used to get three audience members to pick me up and throw me across the room. After a year of that I had an arse that looked like a Rorschach test. That sketch routinely followed another where I aggressively played swingball with the audience in the dark. Took more blows to the head than a teenage dandelion.Yet my body always seemed to let me carry on – it enjoyed the trauma. But recently, after performing them both again, it felt like someone had borrowed my favourite book and returned it with the spine broken, and I was the book. Somewhere along the line, I had gotten old. Or at the very least, older.Now, I love seeing actors incorporate their age on screen. Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, Sylvester Stallone in Creed, Roger Moore in Soft Focus. Their age brings a richness, a depth. But comedy is different, especially live comedy. So much of what you do is who you are and where you are at that particular moment. When you find yourself turning into a tribute act to yourself ... when you find yourself reaching for the tights ... it’s definitely time for a self-intervention.The longer I’ve been in this industry, the hardest challenge I’ve found is staying interested. Starting out gives you carte blanche to do whatever you want, however you want to do it. And after a while, with luck, there might be a level of expectation surrounding you, people deciding to see you rather than stumbling in by accident. This time, they’ll want exactly what you did last time, only bigger, better. Now that can be one hell of a tricky thing, exceeding someone else’s memories of you. More important, it can be limiting as a performer. So how can you take your mind, your body and your audience along on a brand new, giddily delirious trip without losing them along the way?Well, as a character comedian, I often look to perhaps the most complete creation of my lifetime for inspiration. Alan Partridge is clearly getting better with age. He has achieved that rare gift of keeping both relevant and out of touch, often simultaneously. Sure, not all characters can do that and sure, not all character comedians are brave enough to ride shotgun while they do. But with Alan Partridge and Steve Coogan, art has truly become life.Now I don’t have a signature character. I don’t even have a signature. I have an app that does it for me. But this year, I’ve tried to push myself and embrace Father Time with all three of my new shows. They’re all still big, all still bold, all still stupidly paced to raise the audience’s heart rate – and mine – for an hour, but all just a little bit easier on the bones and the buttocks, focusing on one character for an hour instead of the usual half a dozen.For as my 70-year-old mother often told my 80-year-old father: “You’ve got to keep moving, Keith, you’ve got to keep breathing.” And as my 80-year-old father often told my 70-year-old mother: “Shelagh, it’s the middle of the night, go to sleep.” He was wearing tights at the time. Hers. Well, surgical stockings.

It was winter 2011 at Colorado’s Snowball, and with flurries falling lightly against the Rocky Mountain sunset, Big Gigantic playing onstage and a crowd of fans playing tag in the field, Gumber knew festival culture, in all its heady whimsy, was for him. At the same time, he was confounded by the lack of direction provided to the tens of thousands of attendees.“They were basically telling 50,000 people like: ‘Show up. You’ll be fine. Here are some drugs. What could go wrong?’” Gumber says. Gumber, 34, has since dedicated his life to music festivals, having christened himself “The Festival Guy” and hit more than 135 festivals in the last seven years. If you’re a festivalgoer in the US, it’s not unusual to see Gumber from across the field at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Electric Daisy Carnival, SXSW, Okeechobee, Burning Man and many more, typically wearing his signature top hat and surrounded by a gaggle of friends. As of June 2018, Gumber has logged more than 460 festival days of dancing, camping, listening, eating and generally having the time of his life at shows across the country. And in the process, he’s grown quite savvy. While his lifestyle may be non-traditional – Gumber doesn’t have a house and spends most of the year on the road going to shows – as The Festival Guy he’s continuing his family’s legacy of turning hobbies into jobs. His grandfather was an avid golfer and his dad worked for the ision of wildlife in Colorado, where Gumber grew up passionate about live music and the outdoors. “My dad’s entire job was to enforce the correct way to be an outdoorsman,” Gumber says. “I was taught from a young age that there’s a right way to do things.”Which is why what Gumber was seeing at festivals – litter, shoddy campsites, rude attendees, sleep deprivation, lost cars, keys, tents and friends – was so disconcerting. He Googled “guide to festival-going” and found there wasn’t a comprehensive manual on par with those written for more traditional hobbyists like golfers, fishermen, hunters, snowboarders and hikers. There was no one he could pay to give him a lesson. So, he sought out festival veterans, the people with the comfortable chairs, organized campsites and good shoes, and soaked up all their knowledge. He then led by example, finding efficient ways to instill order, and thus greater levels of enjoyment, into the often disorganized and sometimes sloppy festival culture. His goal is to establish festival-going as a legitimate hobby. He’s even trademarked the word “FestivalGoer”.His first taste of success came at Coachella 2011, when he brought a portable phone charger he’d bought online. These chargers weren’t common at the time, and fellow attendees were impressed that Gumber’s phone didn’t die all weekend. “It was just game on from there,” he says. “It was like: ‘There’s a right way to do this and I’m going to learn it.’” For a time Gumber made money by renting the house he had bought in Los Angeles – where he moved after college – when he was 24. (“I was really good at sales,” he says of the purchase.) He eventually sold the house and invested the money into FestEvo, an app he developed that helps fans discover new music, connect with friends and gather festival tips. Everything Gumber owns now fits into a suitcase and carry-on bag. His only major expenses are his cellphone and the cash required to keep the FestEvo servers running, and he typically gets into festivals for free with media or artist passes. At shows he subsists largely on 99-cent tuna packets and protein shakes and says he’s still navigating how to make his lifestyle financially viable. Certainly Gumber’s greatest asset – and most employable skill – is the knowledge he’s accumulated in his hundreds of days of festival-going. Just as a fishing guide can lead you to the best spot on the river or a snowboarding instructor can show you how to carve, Gumber knows what you should wear, how to pack your car and how to avoid post-fest depression. All this information is in The FestivalGoers Guide, his comprehensive book that should be required reading for any car full of 18-year-olds driving off to their first event. “I’ve been able to cover every angle of festivals because I’ve been bitch slapped from every angle,” Gumber says. “In my first year of festivals, there wasn’t one that I didn’t have a moment where I didn’t kind of feel like crying because my phone was dead or I’d lost my friends or I couldn’t find my tent.”Sweet, funny and blessed with a huge and seemingly permanent smile, Gumber’s love for festival culture – and the music, community, nature and travel within it – is obvious. While others might feel a level of burnout after seven years on the road, he remains enthusiastic and dedicated. A few years ago he left Coachella on a Saturday morning at dawn, flew to Oregon to be a groomsman at a friend’s wedding and flew back to the festival the next morning. He even had the wedding DJ play music by all the artists he was missing. Like his father before him, Gumber is a hardcore conservationist. (“I was a four-year-old and picking up trash on hikes with my dad, so it hurt my heart to see the litter at festivals.”) He posts a selfie of his clean campsite after every show, organizes two-minute festival clean-ups on Facebook and travels with his own reusable utensils to cut down on waste. He nearly got into a fight this year at Coachella after approaching a man who had tossed a tomato on the ground. In his book, Gumber also takes a hard stance against sneaking into shows and scalping. “If you’re selling tickets above face value, that’s enough for me to know I don’t need you in my life.”Last weekend, Gumber shared his expertise with hundreds of attendees at Michigan’s Electric Forest. He’ll give the talk again this weekend at the second iteration of the fest, having become the sage veteran with the comfortable shoes he sought out in his early days. He says the best part of the festival was running into people who had benefited from his advice. One guy ran up and gave him a hug, saying he was able to get some sleep by following Gumber’s recommendation of removing the rain fly from his tent to create airflow. Telling this story with the same enthusiasm one might use to recap a great day of fishing or particularly epic day on the slopes, it’s clear this hobbyist turned FestivalGoer has found his calling.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

Previous analyses that include estimates for illegal fishing indicate that wild fish stocks are declining faster than FAO data suggest and that half the world’s oceans are now industrially fished. “Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth, demonstrating that the fisheries sector is crucial in meeting the FAO’s goal of a world without hunger and malnutrition,” said José Graziano da Silva, FAO director general. Many challenges remain, he said, but recent initiatives to crack down on illegal fishing will mark “a turning point” in favour of long-term conservation.The FAO report sets out the huge scale of global fishing: it employs 60 million people and there are 4.6m fishing vessels on the planet. This huge effort is worrying in many places, the FAO says, with too many boats chasing too few fish. As a result, the number of species being overfished has trebled in the last 40 years. The report also states that climate change will drive fish away from warm tropical waters, where nations are often especially reliant on seafood, towards more temperate regions.Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe, said huge improvements were needed across the fishing industry. “Food waste on a hungry planet is outrageous,” he said. “The fact that one-third of all fish caught goes to waste is a huge cause for concern for global food security.” On overfishing, particularly in the Mediterranean, he said: “We know the situation, we have the solutions: setting fish catch limits to scientific advice and stopping illegal and destructive fishing. All we’re missing is political action.” Gustavsson added: “Aquaculture is far from being the magic bullet, as it is often unsustainable. Using 20m tonnes of fish like mackerel, sardines and anchovies to feed farmed fish instead of people is a blatant waste of food.”Prof Daniel Pauly, at the Sea Around Us research initiative at the University of British Columbia, Canada, has been very critical of previous FAO reports, which he says significantly underestimated the total catch by failing to account for illegal fishing.

Heroes in 2018 wear Marks \u0026amp Spencer waistcoats.Gareth Southgate, now inseparable from his signature navy waistcoat, light-blue shirt and striped tie combination, has emerged as an understated paragon of civility at the 2018 World Cup.From social media devotion to thinkpieces about positive masculinity, the England manager is enjoying a swell of support and adoration as he leads his squad closer to the trophy. Geoff Hurst, whose hat-trick against West Germany helped England win the 1966 World Cup, has likened Southgate to Sir Alf Ramsey, saying his leadership has “engendered a good team spirit”. As England’s campaign in Russia got underway, Southgate showed himself to be a reflective soul in an interview with ITV that encapsulated his world view.Asked about whether supporters were “connecting” with the team, rather than offering platitudes, the manager started musing on modern English identity.“We’re a team with our ersity and youth that represents modern England and in England we’ve spent a bit of time being lost as to what our modern identity is, and I think as a team we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”He added: “We have a chance to affect something bigger than ourselves.”The tournament has served as a platform for reminding football fans and non-fans of the kindness and generosity Southgate has shown. Social media is awash with memes, tweets and posts praising the 47-year-old, including a hashtag #GarethSouthgateWould. Examples included Southgate writing personally to fans and devoting his time to young players.Others suggested the support for Southgate reflected a desire for genuine role models.Of course Southgate’s backstory gives his refreshed celebrity an edge. His saved penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final against Germany became one of English football’s most infamous moments. After last week’s game against Colombia, Southgate offered a hug to Mateus Uribe, who missed his spot-kick against England. The tributes continued to come on Sunday, with Andrew Marr presenting his eponymous current affairs programme on BBC One in a Southgate waistcoat and tie.Neil Rowe, from Surrey, England, is enjoying a boom in popularity off the back of the England manager’s run of glory. Rowe’s a Southgate lookalike. Rowe, who is in Russia, told the BBC: “Some fans here in Russia believe I am the real one. Some Colombians were having a go at me yesterday, saying well done to your team for beating us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/020c794a06fbd7cdc1f3e9b59e8e739beee75a58/0_2_2176_1306/master/2176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3037da9ba0260b6e5df2d6a9ce46b07","title":"england gareth southgate semi final","story":"Manager stands on verge of history and talk at his training base has turned to the heroes of 1966 as Croatia semi-final looms“I want to be back home as I hear they are having street parties.” Bobby Robson, 1 July 1990 – Cameroon 2 England 3So far there is only one player who can vouch that England is experiencing the same kind of football frenzy the country last encountered when World in Motion was in the charts, when there was Bobby Robson and Gary Lineker and Nessun Dorma and let’s-all-have-a-disco and Paul Gascoigne, with that big, chip‑pan grin, until everything went so horribly wrong.Fabian Delph has been trying to explain it to his teammates after his visit home for the birth of his daughter. Delph kept sharp by training at Manchester City. He flew back in a private jet with the family of Vincent Kompany, his club colleague, and he is being perfectly serious when he says England’s penalties against Colombia brought his wife, Natalie, into labour. Delph was home for four days and, now he is back in Repino, he has let the others know the madness of it all.“We are out here in our bubble, our circle, and we don’t have outside distractions so we are not aware of what is going on. But going back was incredible. The support was absolutely amazing. Even people who are not into football, stopping me, shouting and telling me: ‘Make sure you bring it home.’ It was crazy, overwhelming. I have told the lads and they could not believe it.”How, after all, can you do it justice when none of these players is old enough to remember that night in Turin 28 years ago? Are they aware of the survey that estimates one in 10 people is contemplating pulling a sickie for England’s semi-final against Croatia? Or the story from Nottingham’s Theatre Royal about the final scenes from Titanic: The Musical being interrupted by the cries of “yes” from two women in the front row? England’s players have been following through Twitter. But it is difficult, as Delph says, to comprehend unless you have seen it close up. “We are in for a shock when we are finished and go home.”Back in Repino, meanwhile, the train to St Petersburg trundled through and most of the tweeting came from the birds in the pine forests. The FA deliberately chose this venue for England’s World Cup base because it was so quiet and out of the way. One supermarket, a pharmacy next door and a few miles along the coast, in Zelenogorsk, is the training ground and, for reasons unexplained, a statue of a dachshund in the centre of the village.Did Southgate get that pint of bitter he said he was craving after the quarter-final victory against Sweden? England’s manager once had a reputation as the kind of man who would paint the town beige, not red. But it was never correct. Above all Southgate wants his players to enjoy these moments and drink it all in. Families were invited into the team hotel on Sunday. The players watched the game together and, behind the smoked windows of the team bus, Southgate had asked every member of his backroom staff to help create a playlist, two songs each. At Euro 96 the players used to sing Three Lions on the way to Wembley. Here they had another sing-along. “The players were actually quite happy,” Southgate reported. “They got us to turn it up.”It was a happy camp and there was a lovely moment, before leaving the Samara Arena, when a few of us let Southgate know the video of his celebrations with the fans, conducting the England orchestra, was already online. Before that there was the screaming, fist‑pumping “come on” that went viral after the Colombia match. We showed him the footage. “There’s the emotion,” he said. “The fans have paid a lot. They have come a long way and to be able to connect with them … I’d love to be able to do it with the however many millions who are watching at home but the supporters who are here, they’re singing, and I know what they’ve been through.“I met lots of them before we came. They told me their stories, how many years they have been travelling to watch England and what it meant to them. I played for three clubs and I have a real affinity with all three but England has been the biggest part of my life.” For the first time there was a brief moment when it sounded as if his voice was cracking.Southgate was a 19-year-old on the books of Crystal Palace, still living with his parents in Crawley, when Italia 90 was alive. He watched the semi-final against West Germany at a mate’s house with a curry and some beers but even then the teenager was learning for the future. Southgate taped all the matches of that tournament. “I videoed it to look at the players, the matches and, as a young player, I guess I wanted to see the best players, the level they were playing and what I could learn from it.”England’s beaten semi‑finalists came back to an open-top bus parade – the lingering memory being Gazza wearing a pair of fake breasts – and maybe that was part of the problem. Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, France and all the elite football nations would never celebrate losing a semi-final. Southgate was part of the England team that reached the same stage of Euro 96. “It doesn’t mean a lot now,” he volunteered.The point here is that, for all the nostalgia surrounding 1990, that penalty shootout defeat in Turin was a bad experience for England and the only glory, in the truest sense of the word, went to the winners. Will Southgate tell his players the same holds true now? “I don’t think I’ll need to,” he replied. “They know what they want to do. They know they stand on a moment of history and they are desperate to do as well as they possibly can. They don’t need any motivation for this now. It’s all there, it’s all apparent.”Southgate gave the impression he would rather have faced Russia in the semi-final on Wednesday, acknowledging that England would encounter a “really top team” in Croatia, but it would come as a surprise now if they were suddenly afflicted by stage-fright or the kind of inferiority complex he detected, as a player, before the 2002 quarter‑final against Brazil.“We are enjoying the journey. Everything we’ve done has been based on enjoyment. How far can we go? Let’s push the boundaries, let’s create our own history. We know where we are, we know we’re not the finished article and I don’t think we have loads of world-class players. There are other teams in the tournament who have a better collection of iniduals but we’ve been a real team. We have some excellent players, no doubt about that, but the collective strength has been massive.”A small thing, perhaps, but this was the first time Southgate has felt comfortable enough to talk about the possibility of going all the way, of heading back to Moscow next Sunday and testing his poorly shoulder in the Luzhniki Stadium by lifting a trophy that, for so many years, always seemed out of reach. If you were English, it was reassuring to hear. And just a touch surreal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef5a266c59dc1d218000313123da8b2423fcfcd/0_210_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0e6987487fb73a927c52bd38c4377ae","title":"its coming home the meaning behind the three lions lyrics","story":"An old football refrain echoes through the streets of England as the 1996 song roars againAs many of us laid our heads to rest on Saturday night with windows wide open to offset the effects of the relentless summer heatwave, the distant call of England football fans howling “it’s coming home” may have echoed in the street outside.Many will recognise the slurred refrain as the choral lyric to the 1996 No 1 single Three Lions, penned by Scouse Britpop band the Lightning Seeds and the then-relatively baby-faced comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel.Others may more readily know the line from a run of optimistic internet memes.But the verse of Three Lions, which was released 22 years ago, has left even football-savvy younger fans a little confused.The refrain “it’s coming home”was actually a reference to the fact that when the song was released, England was hosting its first major football tournament since the 1966 World Cup. But the snippet has evolved to refer to both England’s hopes of bringing home the World Cup trophy but also the disputed spiritual home of football. The international governing body, Fifa, says football in its current form was invented in England in 1863. But earlier versions of the sport can be traced much further back to widespread countries including China.The three lions have a history going back to the 12th century, when a standard with three gold lions on a red field was carried into battle to inspire the troops. Monarchs in the middle ages were sometimes referred to as lions due to the big cat’s associated characteristics of bravery, aggression and having great hair.Then there is a reference to “Jules Rimet still gleaming” – not as some have misheard “jewels remain still gleaming”.Rimet was the longest-serving president of Fifa, who held the post for 33 years and who started the World Cup competition in 1929. The original World Cup trophy was named after him – the trophy England won in 1966.And when Skinner, Baddiel and the Lightning Seeds’ frontman, Ian Broudie, describe “that tackle by Moore and when Lineker scored” and “Bobby belting the ball, and Nobby dancing” they are making reference to the England football heroes Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles of the 1966 World Cup-winning team and the England footballer-turned-Match of the Day presenter-turned-crisps promoter, Gary Lineker.And when they sing “but all those oh, so nears wear you down through the years”, they are referring to defeats in the past including the penalty shoot-out loss at the World Cup in 1990. Since then there have been many more, including penalty shootout defeats in the 1998 and 2006 World Cups as well as in the 1996, 2004 and 2012 European Championships, which is why you would be forgiven for presuming, going by the response from some fans and some in the media, that England had won the actual World Cup and not a match in the round of 16 against Colombia.England will play their first World Cup semi-final in 28 years on Wednesday, the last time being against West Germany in 1990 – six years before Three Lions was released. Back then it was all about New Order’s World in Motion and the John Barnes rap. But we’ll save that for another article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2dcabecd8e262c729b99a0f2844ff672365af7e/0_50_1671_1002/master/1671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06f0190dec9dd031d020b6e19c69438","title":"olivier giroud france striker no goals hope belgium","story":"The striker has yet to score in 412 World Cup minutes but is content to play his part in letting Mbappé and Griezmann shineCan France win the World Cup with a centre-forward who fails to score a goal? Olivier Giroud has yet to get off the mark in 412 minutes of football spread across five appearances at these finals but his name will be among the first on the France teamsheet for Tuesday’s semi-final against Belgium and neither player nor manager is losing any sleep about his drought continuing.While Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann enjoy the limelight Giroud is quietly going about his business, out of the race for the Golden Boot but well in the running for a World Cup winner’s medal. Left out of the starting XI for the opening game, Giroud has selflessly played the role of target man since, giving Mbappé and Griezmann the freedom to flourish.Giroud is spot on with those 1998 statistics and, what is more, there are other cases in recent times when World Cup winners have not been blessed with a prolific No 9. Miroslav Klose scored twice in five appearances for Germany in 2014 and Luca Toni finished with the same tally for Italy in 2010, despite playing in every match.Didier Deschamps sees other qualities in Giroud beyond goals, which is why he turned to the Chelsea striker after France’s unconvincing 2-1 win over Australia, when a three-pronged attack featuring Mbappé, Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé never clicked. The balance feels so much better with Giroud as the focal point. Strong with his back to goal, the 31-year-old liberates others with his presence as much as his touches.Giroud’s scoring record for France is impressive, though. With 31 goals from 79 internationals he is joint fourth on France’s all-time list, level with Zinedine Zidane and behind only Thierry Henry, who scored three times during that 1998 triumph, Michel Platini and David Trezeguet – not bad company to keep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0284145d4a5bd51cd23d7b0e1bdae711a44b9cba/0_36_1739_1043/master/1739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4753a281d43ddd505d549922cf633a8e","title":"thierry henry belgium stay in shadows france world cup semi final","story":"The former France striker is an inspiration to the Belgium players but will not put himself in the spotlight as they prepare to face France in the World Cup semi-finalAs Belgium began their World Cup preparations there was one coach who looked as if he was competing for a place in the starting XI. In the sprints he was up there with the best. During the warm-up exercises he barely lost the ball. You could see that he takes care of himself and his diet.His name? Thierry Henry, of course. Such details enhance the former Arsenal forward’s status as an idol in the Belgium set-up and help to make him a perfect link between the players and staff.But suddenly there are other links to consider, too. This week Henry has been thrust into the position of trying to help those players defeat the country of his birth, for whom he won 123 caps, not to mention a World Cup and European Championship.Henry’s presence on Belgium’s bench for their semi-final against France on Tuesday has prompted no shortage of comment from Les Bleus. “It’s bizarre,” Didier Deschamps, the coach, told Téléfoot. Olivier Giroud was more forthright. “I would be proud to show Titi that he chose the wrong camp,” he said. The striker believes it will be a “peculiar match” for Henry.What Henry makes of it remains a mystery. Interview requests and demands to get him to a press conference were brushed aside. He prefers to leave the talking to the others. The 40-year-old does not want his massive shadow to take limelight away from those who have a bigger influence on performances.No one in the Belgium camp carries a reputation as substantial as the former Arsenal striker’s. He is the most decorated staff member, with a Champions League and five league titles to add to those honours with France. He was – and still is – worshipped by millions of fans. He presents an image of charm, wit, intelligence and flair.Even in Russia, 20 years after he won the World Cup, you can feel his aura. Journalists covering Belgium are starting to get slightly annoyed by it. At every press conference comes the same question. A Belgian, Dutchman, Frenchman, Spaniard or Englishman begs for the microphone and asks the player about … Belgium’s second assistant‑manager: “How does it feel to be on the pitch with him?” “What does he add to your game?” “Does his experience help you in the race to the final?”Last week there were plenty of sighs among the reporters but now it is even worse. The Thierry Henry game is on. In the buildup to France‑Belgium the Belgium assistant will have most of the spotlights on him: the temporary enemy of France. His reputation, nationality and past drawn as a shadow over him, at a moment when he was enjoying a role in the shade.Henry joined the Belgium squad in 2016, a few weeks after Roberto Martínez had been appointed as manager, and since has given one interview: to Belgium’s public broadcaster, in which he emphasised that he wanted to stay out of the limelight. “I am not the national manager, neither am I the assistant manager,” he said. “I’m the T3, the third coach. From the beginning I have said that everybody had to keep calm. It’s not the Thierry Henry show I’m here to help the manager and the squad. The manager is the one who will do the talking, I will try to make the team better. As a coach you don’t have to mention what you have done as player in the past. And as a coach I haven’t proven anything.”That was something he made clear to the Belgian football federation (KBVB) too, when an agreement was concluded in August 2016 in Monaco. In support of Martínez and his first assistant, the Englishman Graeme Jones, the governing body wanted a coach who had copious experience as a player, had won trophies and could transfer his know-how and winning mentality to this generation of players.It was early in the process of searching out a successor for Marc Wilmots that Ralf Rangnick, now the director of football of RB Leipzig but then one of the three main candidates, mentioned that Henry was interested in joining Belgium.Rangnick said that, if he got the job, Henry should join him as an assistant. Rangnick was not appointed but Martínez welcomed with open arms the suggestion of taking Henry on to his staff. KBVB directors have never hidden that Henry was getting work experience for his coaching badges. He was allowed to keep his well-paid job as a pundit with Sky and his demands were modest – he earns about €2,500 (£2,200) a week and apparently donates his wages to charity. Unlike Martínez, who signed a new two‑year deal before the World Cup, Henry has not accepted an offer to continue. The Belgian FA hopes he will extend, too.When Henry was introduced to the players in their hotel in Zaventem in September 2016, some were amazed to meet him. He was one of their childhood idols. Some, such as Christian Benteke and Michy Batshuayi, had posters of him on the wall. A source in the KBVB said: “You should have seen their faces. Priceless reactions.” Batshuayi, master of social media, immediately posted a picture of Henry and him: “Learning from the best.”Henry acts like a teacher, too. He regularly pulls the attackers aside to talk about their movement and positioning. At one of the first meetings he asked Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and co to show clips and would give his observations. Henry, a perfectionist, does not mince his words. He can be very hard and forthright with the players. His little tricks help them. The younger squad members, in particular, listen to everything he says.Lukaku was one of the first to knock on his door. They are similar characters and have a very natural relationship. “I have already told Thierry Henry that I have found out his technique to score goals,” Lukaku has said. “I’m not yet there, but I’m slowly getting there.”Even in England they sometimes meet. “We discuss what I have to do better. I also talk him sometimes through some old games. One with Arsenal in the 2005-2006 season, for instance. I can tell you all about it, and then he brings out details from one of my matches, and together we look for ways in which I can do even better. I learn from him every day. The way of moving, how to find the spaces, control the ball as well as possible. He could do it all. I have learned so much from him.”As a coach Henry is in the first place an observer. He takes care of the attacking set pieces but during the open group sessions he stays in the background. Others do the talking. Before each session he puts out the cones and at the end he removes them. Usually, while waiting for the players to leave the pitch, he does tricks with the ball. “I think that this is mainly school for him – these are his first years as a coach,” Dries Mertens has said.Among the players Henry still likes to behave like one of the boys. He was seen playing basketball with Hazard and Benteke he watches games with Vincent Kompany, who lifted him in the air after the Brazil game he jokes around. “He is an idol for everyone within the group,” Youri Tielemans has said. “Someone who laughs very often and still has a boys’ mentality.”But will he be laughing if he helps Belgium to slay France?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/365065c8144f3d7eca36ee3c317eadd7fc1f79b7/0_148_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10acd68aa2624ce70659bd83d92e0d94","title":"football transfer rumours eden hazard to join real madrid","story":"Today’s fluff is still taking it all inFlorentino Pérez has not had time to sign off Cristiano Ronaldo’s £88m move to Juventus, for he has been scouting Russia high and low in search of his next golden galáctico.

The Croatia midfielder would spend four seasons at White Hart Lane and it was a period in which he had a close-up view of the travails of the England team the angst, anger and ision that characterised the feel of it.England would qualify for the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 but there was little to write home about from either. They flopped at the former, with one of the low points being Wayne Rooney’s on-camera critique of the jeering travelling support after the group‑stage draw with Algeria, while they went into their shells at the latter to exit on penalties to Italy.Modric remembers all of the stuff about the disconnect between the nation and the squad how managing England was the Impossible Job. It would remain the case after his transfer to Real Madrid. As he racked up the titles, including one Champions League after the other, England continued to resemble a stuck record.What worries Modric and the rest of Croatia, as they prepare for the World Cup semi-final against England in Moscow on Wednesday, is their opponents’ new-found unity. Quite simply, it is not supposed to be this way but, listening to Modric and other members of the Croatia set-up after their penalty shootout victory against Russia in the quarter‑final on Saturday night, it was plain that Gareth Southgate’s work has left them wary.“They are looking strong as a team,” Modric said. “I don’t know if there is a different mentality but it seems that they are more like a team. They have this togetherness that is very important to have success.”Davor Suker, the former Croatia striker, who is now the president of the country’s football federation, echoed Modric’s sentiments. “What I would like is to face the England team of before but now they are very strong and we have to respect them,” Suker said. “It is not money that will play – or Ferraris or watches. It will be 11 warriors against 11.”Modric played with the England defenders Kyle Walker and Danny Rose at Tottenham while he remembers the baby steps of Harry Kane into the professional game. Kane played a clutch of Europa League ties at the beginning of the 2011‑12 season, including one – a 2-1 home defeat against PAOK Salonika – in which he and Modric started.“Harry was young and just coming up,” Modric said. “He was always a hard worker. I actually remember one story about him but I will keep it to myself.”That little tease drew a predictable reaction from the journalists in attendance but Modric was more forthcoming about a couple of matters that stand to shape the semi‑final – England’s set-piece prowess and the respective levels of fatigue.Modric and his team-mates watched England’s 2-0 regulation time win over Sweden in the quarter-final earlier on Saturday and they noted how Harry Maguire’s headed opener from a corner had shaped the occasion. Corners or free-kicks have led to seven goals for England in the tournament.Croatia suffered a damaging lapse on a Russia free-kick deep into extra time, which enabled Mario Fernandes to head the equaliser. They have conceded only three goals at the finals and one of the others came when they failed to defend a long throw into the box during the last‑16 penalty shootout victory against Denmark.Some of the Croatia players looked out on their feet during extra-time against Russia and bodies have started to buckle. The goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic, had carried a hamstring problem into the game, which he would feel at the end of normal time only to play on after treatment, while the right‑back Sime Vrsaljko was forced off in extra time with a knee injury.“England have suffered less than us,” Modric said. “And we have fewer days to recover for the semi-final than we did for the quarter-final. But it’s a semi-final. We will find the extra motivation, the extra everything.”Modric was excellent against Russia, his influence growing in the second half after Zlatko Dalic introduced the defensive midfielder, Marcelo Brozovic. Previously, Modric and Ivan Rakitic had played in the centre of a 4-2-3-1 formation now, they were released further forward, either side of Brozovic, in a 4-3-3. Modric has consistently looked better when he has played higher up the pitch and it is plain that one of England’s major challenges will be to nullify him.What has shone through from the Croatia camp is how much relish there is for the meeting with England. The belief is that, unlike Denmark, in particular, and Russia, Southgate’s team will try to make the game they will play on the front foot.“We like to play against teams like England because we have fast players and it will be open,” Vedran Corluka, the former Manchester City and Tottenham defender, said. “We both want to have the possession, we want to win. England’s style is a bit like Manchester City’s, especially with Stones who is always on the ball. Hopefully it will be like Wembley in 2007, when we won 3-2!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c9ebd0c9c5818098e1724d0c442d145a8fb3a36/0_10_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad45b7e7bd5c6144ef3175dd8921f08","title":"kylian mbappe boldness france belgium world cup semi final","story":"Belgium’s progression through two big games could give them an edge in World Cup semi-final, so young French forward must prove a threat with his close control and accelerationSo, here we are in the semi-finals. This was the target set for Didier Deschamps by the French Federation, so he can take a bow and say the job’s done but now we’re in the last four the tournament really begins. We’re two more wins from a second star on the France shirt and we have the quality to go all the way, especially if Kylian Mbappé carries on playing the way he has been in the past couple of games. Like just about everybody, I have been really impressed by him.The Argentinians were not very fast and left great spaces that allowed Mbappé to express his pace and show how dangerous he can be if you let him run at you. The way Argentina played, with a high back‑line and slow defenders, was almost too good to be true from a French point of view. I was really looking forward to how he would cope with the challenge of playing Uruguay, who we knew would defend deeper, leave him less space and look to throw him off his stride.But even with less room in which to manoeuvre we saw just how useful Mbappé can be. Right from the off he took defenders on, looking to create danger with his close control, acceleration and dribbling skills. I was impressed by the way he went at them right from the start. Deschamps has clearly told him to express himself, to enjoy himself even, and that is the way he has to play. Some criticised him for what they thought was a touch of the Neymars in the second half but you have to just go along with his exuberance – he’s at the World Cup, playing huge games that the whole world is watching and he’s having fun – it’s great. (That said, I may have taken a different point of view back in my days as a defender.)I liked the way Mbappé was strong physically, stood up to the opposition and was able to resist in a physical battle. He has no fear, and that’s where I am reminded of Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet from 1998. They also possessed this insouciance and ambition that allowed them to perform on the biggest stage in the world. I remember the shootout against Italy in the quarter-finals when they stepped up to take a penalty when some of their more experienced teammates really didn’t want to – me included. And they both scored.It is early to be comparing Mbappé with Pelé or Thierry Henry, however much I understand the need to find parallels. At the same age, I would say Thierry did not have the same ability as Mbappé but he had intelligence, brain and the desire to become the best.Mbappé is with a club where he will be looked after and his talent will be nurtured. What he does next is vital. Who knows what might happen if Cristiano Ronaldo decides to leave for Juventus and Real Madrid want to recruit Mbappé? I remember Henry left Monaco for Juventus and that it didn’t really work out for him. He made the right choice to join Arsenal and find a manager who would help bring out the best in him. That’s why choices are so important.Mbappé needs time and we mustn’t rush him. But I have great faith in his ability to succeed because I can see the work he puts in for the collective. He offers solutions with his runs, his willingness to make himself available and even take knocks for the team.In France, some fans railed against Antoine Griezmann because he didn’t celebrate his goal against Uruguay. He explained that he has many really close friends who are Uruguayan, guys who have helped shape his career and guys who are really close in his personal life, like Diego Godín, who is the godfather to Griezmann’s daughter, so I’m not too worried by that.Marouane Fellaini proved too hot for France to handle a year out from their hosting of Euro 2016, with two goals before half-time at the Stade de France, before Radja Nainggolan and Eden Hazard added two more after the break. It was France’s second defeat since the 2014 World Cup, and proved a portentous sign before their loss to Portugal in the final at Saint‑Denis a little over 12 months later.The last time the sides met competitively was in the King Hassan II Cup in Casablanca as preparation for the World Cup later that year. A single second‑half goal from Zinedine Zidane was enough to separate them, with France going on to \u0027win’ a mini-league also including Morocco and Glenn Hoddle’s England, who drew 0-0 with Belgium before losing on penalties.France won the battle for pride in Puebla at the Mexico World Cup, claiming third place with two goals in extra time after the 90 minutes ended 2-2. Jan Ceulemans had given Belgium the lead, before Jean-Marc Ferreri and Jean-Pierre Papin hit back, with Nico Claesen levelling things. Goals from Bernard Genghini and Manuel Amoros condemned Belgium to fourth place after both sides had lost their respective semi-finals 2-0.\u0026nbspWith eight teams competing in France at the 1984 European Championship, the hosts were in impressive form on their way to a first major international title. Both sides had won their opening games – Belgium 2-0 against Yugoslavia, the hosts 1-0 against Denmark – but a hat-trick from Michel Platini and one each from Alain Giresse and Luis Fernández made for a miserable night for the Belgians in Nantes.The first major tournament match, indeed the first non-friendly, between the sides came in France at the last World Cup held before the second world war – and the final one without a group stage. The host nation’s win in their opening game, courtesy of a first-minute goal from Émile Veinante and a double from Jean Nicolas, set up a quarter-final meeting with eventual champions, Italy, who won 3-1 in Paris.He had an uneven performance in that match and still hasn’t finished a game at this World Cup, but seven goals in his past six knockout games, at Euro 2016 and here at this World Cup, show us he’s a big-game player. Although he may have been a bit lucky with his goal against Uruguay because of the goalkeeper’s fumble, it’s a timely reminder of the importance of shooting on target.One of Didier’s great qualities is the way he controls his squad. He’s the boss. He has been obliged to change a lot of players since Euro 2016 and yet he has found a compatibility among those he has picked. Didier also has the intelligence to give his players space – you won’t find him lecturing the youngsters about how it was in his day. He’s too smart for that. And he’s reaping the rewards for his approach. You can see the players believe in him and what he’s doing.What impressed me most against Uruguay was how we controlled the game. Some of the younger players are showing great maturity and I was really struck at how well this France team managed things once they had hit the second goal. Physically, too, the players look dominating. Our full‑backs were tough in the tackle, our central defenders commanding – I saw that Luis Suárez never touched the ball in the France penalty area and you have to give our guys great credit for that. I got the impression that, physically, our team still has a bit under the pedal and that is what encourages me for the game to come against Belgium, because we will need that extra energy. Nobody has really pushed us yet. And with N’Golo Kanté protecting the defence like nobody else at this World Cup – what a player – we are looking solid at the back.Belgium, though, have had two big games that might give them an edge against France. Whereas we still haven’t been fully tested, they have been through examinations of their talent and their character that can give them a certain confidence.Coming from behind to beat Japan, having to change their gameplan, find solutions and then winning in dramatic style like they did gives a team a huge boost. It gives you belief, too. And they just eliminated the tournament favourites, a good Brazil team, which is another big plus for the Belgians. Their confidence will be sky high and rightly so. They have been tested and found the resources, found the answers. That is why I make them slight favourites for the semi-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7339209f3b7237e4868c95df171f93d89890c6df/0_3_2601_1561/master/2601.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42bd620bf1021b06f2c7ddc1fe39a2e","title":"world cup 2018 buildup to the semi finals begins live","story":"Belgium have been training already today, a session in which Roberto Martinez appears to have quite deliberately wet himself.There’s not a lot of official World Cup activity scheduled today, but this is what I’ve got (all times BST):1.30pm England “media opportunity”.

The local Saturday football league, the Winchester \u0026amp District League, folded in 2010. After France’s crushing victory over England in the 2018 World Cup Final (10-0), Ousmane Dembele was appointed manager, with the intention of bringing a Southern American atmosphere to the club.Hello world! Simon Burnton here, taking over for the next, well, while. I start with more news on Belgium’s team quiz. This is a pretty hard photo round, in my opinion.

Terrible omen!”’s own Priya Ramesh has also made this point, and far better than I have. It’s not news that black players are always analysed and described in the vocabulary of brawn a little more than brain. But it remains something to keep an eye on, in my opinion.Romelu Lukaku is smart. We need to talking about it more. Too often the analysis boils down to the cliches of power and pace, but the evidence is before us. That run really is a thing of beauty, and a lesson in intelligence, quick wit and movement. In Russia, the Belgian striker has consistently excelled in his build-up play. It’s been a tournament for appreciating strikers’ off-the-ball work – Giroud, Griezemann, Firmino etc. – and it’s time Lukaku got the acclaim too. He’s nabbed the goals, made the runs and his passing, especially to De Bruyne for that lethal stab against Brazil, has been spot on. I’ve just been informed that Round 4 of the Belgian team’s trivia night is probably about past goals of the tournament. Answer no.3, Saeed Al-Owairan, is remembered for this effort from USA 1994.Could the question have been about best goals scored against Belgium?In a spot of non-World Cup transfer news, Cristiano Ronaldo has dropped what seems to be another hint at the Juventus transfer rumours swirling around.Also Paulinho’s headed back to Guangzhou Evergrande after a fairly successful season at Barcelona.

Step forward José Pékerman – or rather, don’t. KevBod has a great shout for the Colombian coach as Worst Dressed Manager.On the subject of worst dressed manager - while Sampaoli is an obvious choice, he could have got away with it with around 2 stone less girth and a permanent demeanour of shit, I\u0027ve left the gas on at home didn\u0027t help either (might partly explain why the team played like startled rabbits as well) . I\u0027d vote for Pekerman - absolutely fine until you look at his feet (not with a suit for goodness sake man!).Far out, this is spot on. Look at this unflattering photo I picked out from the exit to England. He looks like a toy soldier stuck on a hotplate – plastic all pooling down to his feet.Sampaoli owns a tanning salon in Macclesfield, drives an Audi A3 with £16k finance outstanding and stands at the bar in Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge drinking Czech lager FACT.Not only was Jogi Löw poorly dressed, but in a bit of a follow-up to his Euro 2016 scratch-and-sniff antics, this year he could be seen very slyly picking his nose and eating the \u0027treasure\u0027, seemingly not realising he was on camera being watched by millions of people around the world. Lesson most definitely not learnt.Crucial kit news. Sound the klaxon, England will face Croatia in all-white. I’m seeing a mixed response in the replies. The dreamers say it’s a good omen – England wore white in the semi in 1966, then went and won the thing in red. But the away strip has the stats behind it. England are on an eight-year unbeaten streak in red, with 9 wins and 8 draws since losing to Germany in South Africa. Folks this is gonna decide it all!Ah Tony06, I’m with you there. I guarantee I haven’t forgotten Aliou Cissé. Still my pick for the coolest manager, gutted that he and his team went home so early, and definitely a sex symbol. He trumps Sir Gareth for style icon in my opinion. Memories are short. Remember that before Southgate-mania swept the UK, it was generally agreed that the coolest manager was Senegal\u0027s Aliou Cissé. With his dreadlocks, unique body language, being the only black manager at the World Cup.... he was even asked about being a sex symbol at a press conference, for goodness\u0027 sake!Its very hard to pull off a v neck on a guy... got to be young and pretty with a nice flat chest for it to look elegant rather than naff..She said yes! Congrats Bozza and Sara. Here’s today’s plan for Belgium: I don’t quite get the activity listed for 8.30 though. Physio, games and squad bonding? Any suggestions? Oi everyone in the comments – fewer Brexit jokes and more submissions for Worst Dressed Manager please. Here’s the man to beat: And if you’re into the 28 club curse... Then don’t pick: Ashley Young (32), Gary Cahill (32), Jamie Vardy (31), Fabian Delph (28), Kyle Walker (28) or Danny Rose, who turned 28 just last Monday. At 19, Trent Alexander-Arnold is the youngest in the squad. Give him a go Gareth! The 28 club and Jordan Henderson. I’ve seen this stat doing the rounds, that the only England player to miss a penalty against Colombia was over 28. Kane (24), Rashford (20), Trippier (27) and Dier (24) all put them away – unburdened via youth of England’s past penalty horror. Hendo, who just turned 28 on the 17th of June, had a pretty good effort saved. This is just a roundabout way of asking – if it comes down to it again – who do you want taking the penalties? Send me through your first 5. Yep, what a World Cup.This is a summer that people will still be talking about when your kids kids are old.Full sun everyday, decent heat, a wonderful football tournament.... and it all just crept up on us.Just glad that Brazil, Germany and Spain cannot win again. World football needs a new champion or at least a team that has not won for a long time. France won in \u002798 so I would be happy to see England, Croatia or Belgium win.It’s fair to say hopes are high for Belgium v France. Neighbours, rivals, two fantastically talented attacking squads. And in the middle of it all, Thierry Henry. His influence on this Belgium team has given an already mouthwatering clash extra spice. Henry’s presence on Belgium’s bench for their semi-final against France on Tuesday has prompted no shortage of comment from Les Bleus. “It’s bizarre,” Didier Deschamps told Téléfoot. Olivier Giroud was more forthright. “I would be proud to show Titi that he chose the wrong camp.”He’s got no goals, but Giroud could Guivarc’h (I’m using it as a verb) France past Belgium and beyond, writes Stuart James.While Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann enjoy the limelight Giroud is quietly going about his business, out of the race for the Golden Boot but well in the running for a World Cup winner’s medal. Left out of the starting XI for the opening game, Giroud has selflessly played the role of target man since, giving Mbappé and Griezmann the freedom to flourish.Here’s how England’s players are spending their rest days. I have the exact same set up going now in the ’s Sydney office.Me and Mike Hytner are recreating this as we speak.Belgium to win it all, England to lose the final, and France and Croatia out in the semis. Well that’s what the latest power rankings say. Read on:Nakul Bhagwat writes in with the first email. And it’s a cracker. “Long time reader, first time writer,” he begins. “Sir Gareth seems to be the consensus choice for best dressed manager at this year’s World Cup. Who was the worst dressed? My nomination is Jorge Sampaoli with his slightly too tight t-shirts, which (fittingly) seemed to be buckling under the pressure.”Great pick, Nakul. I’ll say Joachim Löw. Eight years ago, I thought his wavy fringe and European v-neck were a breath of fresh air. But there was something about this year’s number, a thin blue t-shirt, that seemed to be tight in all the wrong places. And yes, the comments were off there for about 20 minutes, but they’re back now! Sound off below the line – who can take Sampaoli’s ill-fitting crown?Er...congratulations Bozza? Mark Bosnich, who is now plying his trade as a pundit for Fox Sports Australia, has just proposed to his partner. Via selfie cam. From Russia. With the wind all rattling in the speaker. Hope she says yes.Spain news: Luis Enrique is the national team’s new manager. It’s in all the papers and leading all the radio bulletins. It will be officially announced, by bigwig Luis Rubiales no doubt, later today. But it looks a done deal. The former Barcelona coach will be appointed permanently now that Fernando Hierro’s rather unsuccessful caretaker stint is over. Enrique, who won the 2015 Champions League with that fearsome trident of Messi, Neymar and Suarez, has been on sabbatical since he left the Nou Camp in May last year.In the eighth episode of the Simpsons’s fourth season (New Kid on the Block), Bart falls in love.

In an effort to encourage them, many state governments now offer money to couples when one partner is from a low caste or is a Dalit (formerly known as untouchable). On 3 July, the Orissa government increased the cash “incentive” from 100,000 rupees (£1,095) to 250,000 rupees. Hitesh Dhingra, co-founder of dating app TrulyMadly, believes there are two reasons for the enlightened views expressed in the survey. One is that young Indians, as users of the internet and social media, are exposed to new ideas that challenge traditional social mores.The other is that, as more millennials choose their partners using dating apps and websites, they are more likely to focus on personality and compatibility than caste and religion. “In an arranged marriage, the parents are going to stick to tradition and to caste considerations,” said Dhingra. “But when young people are out there looking for a partner themselves, then the criteria change. Caste, religion, and income are not uppermost. It’s the person’s personality and behaviour that are important. The whole approach becomes more open-minded.”“What we are seeing are the markers of a new generation that has been shaped by the internet and influenced by attitudes and behaviour they see in developed countries,” said Iqbal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef4f0544b595a2114db9a540734cad7fc66b471/0_2245_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097ffc943bef353960844a452c2c28e8","title":"seven ways to avoid urinary tract infections","story":"Ensuring you drink plenty of water throughout the day may decrease your risk of getting a UTI.Take regular trips to the toilet to empty your bladder. “Holding it in” may result in bacteria having the opportunity to multiply in your urinary tract, giving you an increased risk of infection.Women should be encouraged to empty their bladder after sex. Bacteria can be introduced to the urinary tract during foreplay or sexual intercourse, which should be expelled before the bacteria are allowed to multiply and cause an infection. Additionally, think about what type of contraception you are using – some people find using spermicides can increase UTIs, as can diaphragms.D-Mannose is a natural sugar thought to aid in the removal of E coli during a UTI and stop the infection in its tracks. Recent, small studies have looked at the use of D-Mannose oral powder and compared it with prophylactic antibiotics, and have shown promising results.If you are experiencing UTI symptoms (eg pain on urination, or increased frequency) you should see a doctor, particularly if you suffer from recurring UTIs. You may need a course of antibiotics or possibly an ultrasound scan to investigate the cause of the recurring infection. For example, it could be due to an anatomical abnormality or an inability to fully empty your bladder. A weakened immune system could be causing the repeat infections, which would need further investigation.After visiting the toilet, wiping from back to front can increase the risk of getting a UTI, as you could introduce faecal bacteria into the urinary tract. However, overcleaning is not the answer, as using too many products can alter your flora and raise the risk of getting a UTI.Oestrogen is believed to be protective against UTIs via a variety of mechanisms, meaning that menopausal women with declining oestrogen may be vulnerable to UTIs. In a meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials, it was found that topical vaginal oestrogen was beneficial in reducing UTIs in post-menopausal women.Cranberries and cranberry juice have long been suggested as treatments for UTIs. But studies have shown mixed data on how successful they are. Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins, believed to prevent bacteria from “clinging on” inside your bladder. But cranberry juice may not be that useful, as it can be minimal in actual cranberry content and full of sugar and additives instead – so make sure you get cranberries in a raw form if you want to try this method. If you try a vodka and cranberry while you have a UTI, be aware that the alcohol may irritate your bladder and bring you back to square one with the symptoms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted.

All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward.

That’s what it takes. Have you shown your potential employers that you are hungry for a role?While I spend a lot of time convincing people to join our teams, I also won’t hire anyone who doesn’t really want to work for us. I applied for a competitive internship when I was 19 by photocopying a fashion editor’s shoots, handcrafting them into pop-up books that brought the shoots to life and posting them to him with a handwritten note. Sure enough, he called me the next day and offered me the internship.Once I started, I was hired within a week. Why? First, I knew who I wanted to work for and applied to him directly. Second, energy. I was always early, with a great attitude. I tried to bring energy to the team and give them a reason to smile. Third, I worked on active listening. I watched for how my boss liked things done, what he wanted to eat for lunch, how he liked presentations laid out. He hated the sound of apples being eaten near him, so I would remove any apples on set. Fourth, I worked hard to make a connection with each person in the team, so that I would be remembered and they would mention me to my boss. I would do my work and then ask if any other departments needed help, showing them I was a team player.The key is to make yourself indispensable, so that they start to fear your internship ending.

And she accepted.In Bieberland it was as though North Korea had finally gone and pressed the nuclear button. Pandemonium. Disbelief. Despair. “I’ve only had our wedding and future planned since I was like 9. You did my dirty @justinbieber,” vented Brooklyn Sciford from Omaha, Nebraska.“Engaged??

I did.”“I’ll be going into hibernation to cry for the rest of my life,” said Brianna Smith from Rushville, Indiana.Confirmation of the engagement was yet to come from the couple themselves, though CNN said it had also verified it. The pair was introduced by Hailey Baldwin’s father, the actor Stephen Baldwin, at the New York premier of Bieber’s film Never Say Never in 2011 when she was 14 and Bieber 17.They had a short-lived relationship in 2016, after which Bieber reunited, it now seems temporarily, with the singer-actor Selena Gomez.

It forces May to reshuffle her government, at the same time as trying to convince backbenchers to support her plan.Davis sent a bluntly worded resignation letter to the prime minister, saying he would not be a “reluctant conscript” to the plan agreed at Chequers, which he said was “certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”.Davis has told friends he cannot live with the soft Brexit stance agreed between ministers on Friday, which proposes a “UK-EU free trade area”, governed by a “common rule book”.Davis is said to have been “livid” about hostile briefing from senior figures in Downing Street about how Brexiters would be treated at Chequers – including suggestions they would be given the number of a local taxi firm if they chose to resign.May will now have to confront furious pro-Brexit MPs in parliament on Monday, knowing she has lost the backing of one of the leavers’ champions in government.Downing Street was publicly bullish on Monday, with a source saying the mini-reshuffle to replace Davis and Baker would begin from 9am. The source said: “We have a plan agreed at Chequers, as the PM says in her letter to David Davis, and we are moving forward.”The prime minister is facing a growing backlash from the pro-Brexit wing of her party, with MPs warning they are prepared to trigger a leadership contest.If at least 48 MPs send letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, he would have to call a vote of no confidence – though many of May’s supporters in the parliamentary party believe she could win it.Dozens of Tory MPs have attended emergency briefings in Downing Street since the Chequers summit on Friday, at which Boris Johnson said that colleagues would be “polishing a turd” if they tried to defend the plans to the party and public.The environment secretary is a true Brexit-believer but one who spoke passionately in favour of the prime minister\u0027s Chequers plan on Friday, and was sent out to bat for it on the airwaves on Sunday. He is a member of the inner cabinet Brexit sub-committee and has a firm grasp of the detail. It would give him a platform for a future leadership challenge but there has long been a lack of trust between Gove and Theresa May, dating back to her days at the Home Office when back-and-forth briefing wars forced out her aide Fiona Hill.The PM may choose to appoint a loyalist such as Lidington, who is her de facto deputy at the cabinet office. No 10 has been leading the key decision-making on Brexit ever since Oliver Robbins, formerly Davis\u0027 chief adviser, moved to Downing Street. Putting Lidington in charge would probably enrage leavers but be a formal declaration that the centre of power has formally moved from DExEu\u0027s No 9 Downing Street headquarters next door to No 10.Downing Street was briefing ahead of the Chequers summit that there was a new generation of younger, enthusiastic (and Brexit-backing MPs) ready to take ministers\u0027 places round the cabinet table if they resigned.\u0026nbspHousing minister Dom Raab, DCLG junior minister Rishi Sunak and DWP\u0027s Kit Malthouse were among the names mentioned. It would be an enormous leap from a junior ministerial position to become Brexit secretary, but May could bring in a new generation Brexiter into another department if Gove or Lidington get the nod.The pro-Brexit Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns said it was time for May to be replaced. “Honestly, I think yes,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“The time has come that we need a Brexiteer prime minister, really – somebody who clearly believes in Brexit and is really prepared to deliver what the people voted for.”Her fellow Tory MPs “need to think long and hard over the next few days”, Jenkyns added.Davis had clashed with May on several occasions in recent weeks, including over when the long-awaited white paper setting out the government’s Brexit position should be published.He would prefer a much looser, Canada-style relationship with the EU27 after Brexit — a proposal rejected by the cabinet on Friday.In her reply to Davis’s resignation letter, the prime minister emphasised he had quit “when we are only eight months from the date set in law” for the UK to leave the EU. She rejected his characterisation that the policy agreed at Chequers on Friday would not bring powers back from Brussels to Britain.He told Reuters the resignation was “crucially important” because it showed the extent of concerns about the Chequers agreement. “If the Brexit secretary could not support them they cannot genuinely be delivering Brexit,” he said.The pro-Brexit MP earlier wrote in the Daily : “If the proposals are as they currently appear, I will vote against them, and others may well do the same.”Labour capitalised on the turmoil in Tory ranks. Jeremy Corbyn questioned whether May could still “cling on” to power, while the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, released a tally of Tory resignations since autumn.Before Sunday night’s ructions, May was set to tell the Commons: “In the two years since the referendum result we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing round the cabinet table as they have on breakfast tables up and down our country. Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.”The prime minister also plans a fresh round of high-level diplomacy this week, in a bid to persuade the EU27 not to reject her plan outright.She is expected to talk directly to European leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron“Our message now is to the other side, to Europe, that it’s time to get serious and sit down and talk about it,” she said on Sunday. “It’s now for Europe to be prepared to sit down and move the pace of negotiations on and talk about it seriously and address what we’ve put forward.”Some pro-Brexit MPs fear the prime minister’s plan will be regarded as an opening salvo by Brussels and she will be forced to make further concessions, possibly on free movement, before the next crunch summit in October.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the EU is ready to adapt its offer should the UK’s red lines change. However, May has agreed to ramp up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit in case Brussels – which described her previous customs proposals as “magical thinking” – rejects them.One senior Tory said that the government would have to take “a couple more steps” towards the EU’s position before a final deal was struck, even if it meant Brexiters swallowing more bitter pills. “Behind the scenes there’s a recognition that there needs to be a bit more movement on both sides,” he said.However, a No 10 source said: “Yes it’s a negotiation, but this isn’t about making concessions, this is about challenging the EU. It’s a good, pragmatic, workable solution that benefits all our economies and also our citizens. It’s time for Europe to get serious.”However, May will need to get her proposals past the party first. She will make a statement to the Commons on Monday before facing a fractious meeting of the backbench 1922 committee in the evening.Michael Gove, who is understood to have been instrumental in getting the leave-supporting cabinet on board with the proposals, urged pro-Brexit MPs to rally behind May on Sunday.The leading Brexiter said the deal the prime minister achieved at Chequers was not everything he had hoped for, but it honoured the result of the referendum and the cabinet was behind it, meaning that collective responsibility would prevail.“Those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t make perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the cabinet.“We achieved all of the things that we campaigned for in order to ensure we could leave the EU, but we also do so in a way which respects some of the wishes and some of the concerns of some of my colleagues that voted remain.”One senior pro-Brexit source told the : “It’s terminal. We think this is going to lead to a bigger split than Maastricht, on a more serious issue, with a smaller majority, and it’s not Tony Blair that lies on the other side of all of this, it’s Jeremy Corbyn. We think it’s an absolute disaster.”Most remain-supporting MPs welcomed the proposals as a sensible starting point, adding that the “devil was in the detail” of the Brexit white paper, although former minister Phillip Lee, who quit over Brexit, said it represented an attempt to find the “least worst” option that was not in the best interests of the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bc6ff265659db4a9e098d66ce0e7526c10315bf/0_62_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c8feb4f99f84e98541bfb08746ee0bf","title":"david davis resignation what happens now","story":"Theresa May must find a new Brexit secretary while facing a potential leadership challengeWhat happens next now David Davis has resigned as Brexit secretary?

The Conservatives have 316 MPs, meaning Brady must receive 48 letters to trigger a leadership contest.Reports vary wildly from about 25 to more than 40, depending on which MP you talk to, and the reality is that no one knows apart from Brady. Many of the letters were sent by Conservative MPs furious at the result of the 2017 election, so not all are objections to May’s Brexit stance some just believe she is not up to the job.Should more letters be sent in outrage at May’s Brexit position, it is possible some other MPs could withdraw theirs if they believe it would not be in the national interest to challenge the prime minister so close to the Brexit deadline.Even if a confidence vote is triggered, May’s allies are reasonably confident she could win. She would need more than 150 MPs to vote against her, which far exceeds the “ultras” on either wing of the party.Many pragmatic, mainstream Conservative MPs, whatever their position on Brexit, may view a change of leadership at this stage as disastrous. But much depends on how Downing Street handles dissent in the wake of Davis’s resignation. May could emerge with her confidence and authority shot, even if she escapes defeat and her chances of fighting the next election would be practically zero.It was the delay to the Brexit white paper, which Davis had hoped would be completed before the June EU summit, that enraged him in the weeks before the Chequers summit. May is likely to want to press ahead with publishing the white paper this week, but that will depend on whether there are further resignations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca1b545aaae1dc560dae38e8f58951883ddd15a4/126_303_2363_1417/master/2363.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2881b9bba4fec9cc9ebe85930ae9192d","title":"david davis resignation what we know so far","story":"Brexit secretary quits, saying Chequers blueprint would leave the UK in a ‘weak’ position at bestThe environment secretary is a true Brexit-believer but one who spoke passionately in favour of the prime minister\u0027s Chequers plan on Friday, and was sent out to bat for it on the airwaves on Sunday.

He literally had no clue about even the basics of how the EU works.The irony is that he is now being described as “principled” for running away from the very process he fought for so long to set in motion, now he’s realised what a disaster it will inevitably be. danielearwickerDavis told us that a deal with the EU would be the “easiest ever”. In the two years he’s been in the job he has failed to agree anything, he promised the “row of the summer” over the scheduling of the talks last year and yet caved in on day one. From time to time he threatened to resign, most recently over the sacking of Damien Green and yet he didn’t, now he has decided to go apparently whatever it was that he quite happily signed up to 48 hours ago is no longer acceptable, how can you deal with such people? He’s just another spoilt Tory brat with a sense of entitlement and belief in his abilities that doesn’t match his actual abilities. He has no credibility, he achieved nothing and no one will miss him. Addicks123Davis’ plan was always to leg it before Brexit became a reality. He knew, for all his bluster and bullshit, that a good Brexit was complete fiction and that he didn’t want to be left holding the baby. Davis spent four hours in discussions with Barnier in two years. Davis will be sorely missed. WeallneedThneadsI have read a lot of comments from remain supporters excited by Davis’s resignation. They believe that this will hasten the end of the foolishness that is Brexit. They are sadly mistaken as this event is more likely to lead to a hard Brexit than no Brexit and as such is part of the hard Brexiteers strategy. DonkeyWanLet’s face it. The real reason Davis resigned is that May marginalised him in the negotiations, for good reasons:• He didn’t do his homework on the impact assessments - which were so poor in the end• He showed up for a mere four hours of negotiating time - who can forget that perfect metaphor of a photo where the EU team arrive prepared with stacks of papers, UK pretty much empty-handed• He stated he didn’t really have to be clever to do his job - he isn’t, but he needed to be. But will the 1922 Committee, that May was already set to meet, win tonight’s battle? Leadership contest (not a GE) beckoning? LearningIsLifeLet’s be quite frank about this: Davis had no idea what he was doing, and events have given him the opportunity to run away under the supremely ironic guise of “man of principle”. Loathsome. titmussThe truth is Davis or anyone can never deliver a Brexit that is good for the UK.The reasons behind a Leave victory in the referendum can only be addressed with investment in those Brexit voting areas that have been battered by Tory austerity. It’s no good blaming the EU for problems made in Britain! lisalaneLooking about Davis’ change of demeanour over the months, this was coming, of course. It was clear that in the beginning, he had much more personal investment in how Brexit was to be negotiated, until near the end he clearly stopped caring. He knew that the Brexit negotiations were a train wreck, he would be unable to deliver any of the cake and unicorns, and the only question for him was when to jump ship in order to avoid personal responsibility for it. So it is now. Dup de doo.

(See 00.51am.) Braverman (Suella Fernandes until she married) was Jacob Rees-Mogg’s predecessor as chair of the European Research Group, and is a very hardline Brexiter.But this morning it is being said she is staying. This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who chairs the pro-Brexit European Reseach Group, is hosting his LBC phone-in this morning. He has just said he does not think a no confidence vote in Theresa May is “immediately” in the offing. He said:I don’t think a no-confidence vote is immediately in the offing. I think what the prime minister needs to do is give up on the Chequers proposals which, David Davis has pointed out in his resignation letter, don’t actually deliver Brexit.You’ll note that hint of menace in the word “immediately”. He seems to be implying that, if Theresa May does not drop her Chequers plan, there could be a leadership challenge.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the Today programme earlier that David Davis’s resignation was a “huge blow” to the prime minister and made a no-deal Brexit more likely. He told Today:The Brexit secretary has resigned, effectively voting no-confidence in the prime minister and that plunges her into further chaos ... It exposes what has been the heart of the problem all along which is a huge ision in the cabinet between those that want to stay economically close to the EU and those that want to rip up the economic model we’ve been operating for decades.Starmer rejected the suggestion that the Chequers agreement amounted to Labour policy on Brexit. He said:Look at the differences: we have argued for a comprehensive customs union with the EU. The prime minister has come up with a facilitated customs agreement that works on the basis that you can distinguish at the border goods that are going to stay in the UK and those that are going to go beyond to the EU. Businesses and everybody knows that is unworkable. It is dual system is a bureaucratic nightmare.Labour plans to force a vote on the customs bill next week, Starmer said. We have amendments down saying that the negotiation should seek to keep us in a customs union with the EU.Asked why Labour wasn’t calling for a second referendum, Starmer said: At the moment we are still in the middle of a negotiation so there is nothing to actually have a second referendum about. We have focused on getting a vote in parliament in the autumn on the deal. That’s the first thing that needs to happen.We are not calling for a referendum. There needs to be a meaningful vote in parliament. If the article 50 deal is voted down or worse, there is simply no deal, and today makes that more likely, then I’ve always said we need to have all options on the table as to what we do next. But parliament must decide what happens in those circumstances. We are not at that stage but we do need to realise how serious today’s developments are.Here are some Labour figures responding to David Davis’s Today interview.From Andrew Adonis, the former cabinet ministerFrom David Lammy, the former ministerThe Labour-led Welsh government has put out a statement saying David Davis’s resignation shows the government is “in complete disarray”.The FT’s Kate Allen says there is a quite a difference in how commentators are assessing the impact of David Davis’s resignation and how the markets are reading it.Allen was responding to this tweet.The interview is over. In the post-match interview analysis on the Today programme, Nick Robinson says it is up to David Davis to decide if he wants to make a Geoffrey Howe-style resignation speech in the Commons. Robinson says Davis, who is still in the studio, is giving him “a look” which signals that he is not saying.A David Davis resignation speech in the Commons would be quite dramatic, but it would not be like Howe’s, which was intended to provoke a leadership challenge. Davis has just said, very clearly, that that is not his intention. (See 8.28am.)Q: Are you saying you don’t expect the policy to change as a result of your resignation?Davis says, if nothing else, it will put pressure on May not to make further concession.He says he does not want to see her replaced.Davis says, if May has a Brexit secretary who supports her strategy, that will strengthen her strategy.He says he will not be encouraging people to challenge May’s leadership.He says he would not stand against her.If he had wanted to do that, he would have acted after the election. But he did not. He flew down from Yorkshire in the middle of the night to support her.Davis says it is “very important” May appoints a new Brexit secretary who believes in May’s strategy.Davis says May always made it clear to him when he took the job that she would be in charge of the Brexit negotiations ultimately.He says the EU will now demand further concessions.It seems to me we are giving too much away too easily.Q: What will happen next?Davis says he thinks there might not be a deal by October. There could be an emergency EU summit in November. That is what happens in EU negotiations, he says. He says they go to the wire.Q: What did you disagree with?Davis says the plan for a common rulebook with the EU on goods means that it will be very, very difficult for the UK not to agree with what the EU is doing. Final decisions will be taken by the European court of justice. And if the UK decides it does not want to along with EU rules, the Northern Ireland backstop could be triggered. That would be a “sword of Damacles”.He says any power parliament will have will be “illusory”.This is painted as returning power back to the House of Commons. In practice, it is not doing so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dfea9f362a52f0a723b86d9d7817d18797e26e0/0_21_1100_660/master/1100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65b0f0ef8f18c9ef80bb56ef92da14b1","title":"third class citizens trans actors see stereotyping and exclusion in hollywood","story":"Actors say industry hires men to play trans women, and vice versa, while promoting misconceptions about trans identityIt was the perfect part for Aneesh Sheth. The Indian American actress, who is a transgender woman, was auditioning to play a trans Indian American woman – a rare leading film role that seemed made for her.The director praised Sheth’s performance after a callback, but told her there was one main problem: She wasn’t “masculine” enough. Ultimately, the director cast a man. Sheth’s experience in 2015 is one that trans actors say is still all too common in Hollywood. Producers and directors hire men to play trans women, and visa versa, often promoting damaging misconceptions about trans identity while denying the parts to trans actors who have the lived experience.Trans and gender-nonconforming actors shared stories with the  after news broke that Scarlett Johansson would be playing a trans man in a new film, sparking swift backlash. Hollywood has long given awards to cisgender actors (people who aren’t trans) for playing trans characters, such as Hilary Swank for Boys Don’t Cry and Jeffrey Tambor for Transparent. But there has been growing resistance in recent years. Even Tambor said in an an awards speech that he would be “happy” if he “were the last cisgender male to play a transgender female”.Trans actors said it can be a struggle to get auditions for trans or cis roles, that they get offered two-dimensional characters that perpetuate stereotypes, and that they sometimes face offensive comments about their appearances, bodies and identity.“It’s really disheartening,” said Sheth, 36, who has a part in a new movie with Claire Danes and Jim Parsons. “You spend all this time developing your sense of self. Then you go into the room, and the criticism is not about your work. It becomes about your identity.”Despite some high-profile works starring trans actors – including the new TV drama Pose and award-winning 2017 film A Fantastic Woman – the overall picture is bleak. Advocacy group Glaad reported that no major studio films included trans characters last year, and only 17 characters were trans in the last TV season. Trans male characters are so absent from film and TV that Emmett Jack Lundberg, a trans male film-maker and actor, decided to make his own web series, Brothers, featuring erse stories of trans men. “Trans men don’t exist in most people’s minds,” Lundberg said, noting that his first exposure to trans men was Boys Don’t Cry, a 1999 film based on the true story of a trans teenage boy (played by Swank) who was brutally murdered. Lundberg said the film traumatized him and he didn’t come out and transition until more than a decade later: “I had no experience seeing a positive trans male role model in the media.” In some ways, little has changed in mainstream Hollywood for trans men and transmasculine characters. The parts simply aren’t there, and when they come along once every few years in major films, Hollywood casts women. “As trans people, we don’t often get to play roles that are rooted in that part of ourselves,” said Brian Michael, a trans male actor. “I’m not finding the kind of trans stories I want to embody.” One exception was Ava DuVernay’s show Queen Sugar, which cast Michael as a trans police officer. The role wasn’t a cliched coming out story, he said, but instead someone who “happened to be trans” and had already transitioned. “It’s important to be visible and to tell a story,” he said, adding that for trans youth, “You see that there is something down the road.” Trans women said they often get offers to play sex workers with little depth or get scripts with outdated or inaccurate terms like “transsexuals” and “crossdressers”.Lynne Marie Rosenberg, an actor who runs the CastandLoose blog that publishes offensive character “breakdowns”, provided a few examples. One sought a “male to female transsexual who is as sassy as she is bitchy”, adding, “if the light is right, she can be quite beautiful, but to the observant eye, she isn’t fooling anyone.” Another was looking to cast a “transgender female” who “has a real ‘surprise’ for a few of the guys.” Maybe Burke, an actor who is agender (doesn’t identify as male or female and uses “they” pronouns), said directors would reach out, compliment their look, and then offer them offensive trans women roles: “It’s a homeless sex worker who gets murdered, and I’m like, ‘Thank you so much, I’m so glad you saw that in me.’” Film-makers have also told Burke they are looking for someone who is at a different stage of “transition”, implying they wanted someone more “passable” as a cis woman. “I’m a complete human being walking into the room, and you’re telling me I’m not finished,” they said. Bianca Von Krieg, a trans activist and actress, said that a film that hired her once asked her to send nude photos because, she later learned, they wanted to know if she was trans. Other times, she said, it can feel like casting is simply a “beauty contest” for trans women: “I’ve been treated by other directors and actors like I’m less than human, or I’m a third-class citizen.” On the flipside, trans women have also been told they “don’t look trans enough” for parts, said Isley Reust, another trans actress . “I felt very hurt by that. I can’t even play something that I am.” With so few opportunities, trans actors can face tough choices about where they draw the line and how they pay the bills. Reust said she deeply regretted working on a film that cast a cis man as a trans woman: “I felt shitty afterward, and I feel like I let my community down.” She said she would never do it again. Some trans actors also struggle to decide whether to be open about their identity, recognizing that they might get fewer auditions if directors know they are trans. Angel Qinan, a trans actress, said she is public about her gender, and never gets sent on auditions for cis roles. It can feel limiting, she said. “We can play a sister, a mother, a daughter, a best friend. We can play lead characters.”Ivory Aquino, who has been acting since she was a child, decided to come out as trans last year after she was cast as Cecilia Chung, a trans activist, in the historical series When We Rise. She had long played cis women and knew it could be risky to speak out. “It was more important to share that part of me rather than hold back,” she said, recounting that when she first transitioned as a teenager and thought she would never be able to act again. “Part of me was doing it just to have the visibility for someone who was seeing themselves.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0fcef8f0945eab73876efd84d3a17c905779ea/268_381_4531_2718/master/4531.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c612055e3b06830bed67029a90e37e","title":"uk fertility regulator to issue new rules ivf add ons","story":"Patients will have to be told when fertility treatment extras are not likely to be effectiveIVF patients will need to be told when expensive “add-ons” to fertility treatments are not likely to be effective, under new rules due to be issued to clinics later this year.The crackdown by the government’s fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, comes as an increasing number of clinics are charging patients top-up fees for experimental procedures that have not been tested in clinical trials, or have been shown to make no difference.Under a code of practice due to come into effect in October, subject to approval by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the HFEA will require doctors to explain to patients whether there is any clinical evidence to support extra procedures being offered.Sally Cheshire, the regulator’s chairwoman, said the move was prompted by a recent surge in the variety of treatments on offer and the number of clinics offering them.“Clinics tell us it’s due to patient pressure,” she said. “We’re saying clinics need to be robust and ethical in what they offer, particularly if they’re asking patients to pay for those treatments.”“We know that some patients are being asked to pay double or triple that, or even £20,000 for a cycle, and there isn’t anything particularly different as far as we’re concerned,” said Cheshire. “There’s no effective evidence that these treatments work, and some of them may even be potentially harmful for some patients, which clearly isn’t ethical.”Cheshire singled out reproductive immunology treatments that suppress the mother’s immune system as being of particular concern. There is no good evidence these drugs improve pregnancy rates, and side effects can include chronic infections, septicaemia and severe allergic reactions. “When you are injecting immunosuppressant drugs into your body, it’s not a good thing,” she said.Another add-on offered by some fertility clinics is assisted hatching. It involves using acid, a laser, or other tool to thin the protein coating from which an embryo must break out before it can implant in the womb. The procedure, which costs £400-£500, has not been shown to improve pregnancy rates, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.Other treatments that have been questioned cost more. For £750, time-lapse imaging will track the day-to-day development of IVF embryos under a microscope to help doctors select the ones most likely to lead to a baby. But again, there is no good evidence it increases live birth rates. Jane Stewart, the chairwoman of the British Fertility Society and a consultant in reproductive medicine and gynaecology at Newcastle fertility centre, said: “Over and over again we see new ideas being brought in without the evidence it needs.“A lot of the time, patients are shopping around for what they think they need and that’s wrong, medicine is not like that.”According to a traffic light designation by the HFEA’s scientific committee, none of the 10 most commonly offered add-ons is backed by robust evidence to show an improvement in the success rates of treatment. Earlier this week, a large study concluded an add-on called an endometrial scratch does not improve the chances of a live birth. “The difficulty I have is that it becomes a commercial thing,” said Stewart. “In the clinic, a patient might be told about other treatments and say ‘OK, I’ll have that too’. It becomes a discussion not about the medical problem, but rather if you can afford this or that, then it might be what makes the difference.”The situation can be made worse when people do not get a proper consultation before they embark on fertility treatment. Many couples who are referred for fertility tests will not need IVF, but at private clinics the conversation may move quickly to when IVF will be given and with what extras.Prof Geeta Nargund, a senior consultant at St George’s Hospital in London and the medical director of Create Fertility, said she had previously raised concerns with health commissioners about clinics that were promoting add-ons to NHS patients.She welcomed the introduction of tighter rules, but said the HFEA should also require clinics to provide data on which procedures were being offered to each patient and make it clear what the sanctions would be for clinics that failed to comply with the guidelines. Prof Nick Macklon, the medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said many patients requested extra tests and procedures they have read about.“I spend quite a lot of my time putting patients off this and that, and my colleagues do too,” he said. “I think just to say it’s all nonsense and they’re all cowboys is not the case. Doctors are also looking for therapies that can help people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f82bf3f02ce478c0a5112bfec1d01abd6aac8db/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a047c88e2c7bdc398be75531ad756fe2","title":"castleford leeds super league match report","story":"• Castleford 42-10 Leeds• Jake Trueman inspired for CastlefordIf Kevin Sinfield was not already aware of the size of the challenge in transforming the fortunes of the stuttering Super League champions, he was handed a ruthless indication here.The final scoreline was miserable for Leeds, this comprehensive defeat a record-extending eighth in succession in the league. While there were visible improvements on the final days of Brian McDermott’s reign, the nature of how Leeds collapsed to concede 36 points without reply after half‑time underlined the task for Sinfield.The greater challenges for Leeds in their battle to avoid the Qualifiers are still to come but, with the club two points adrift of the eight, they may now need to win all three of their remaining games to stand a chance. The nature of this collapse does not suggest that is at all likely. “I’ve got the full picture now,” Sinfield said.Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to this Castleford side is they find a way to capture the headlines. Pre-match this was all about Sinfield’s return but Castleford are now all but guaranteed a top‑four finish ahead of the Super 8s. That means an extra home game as opposed to finishing fifth – and for a side such as Castleford, who are notoriously tough to beat at home, that cannot be underestimated on the run to the play-offs, and indeed, the Grand Final.On Sinfield’s first day as a coach, how envious he must have been watching the prowess of Castleford’s Jake Trueman. Daryl Powell, the Tigers coach, said of half-back: “He’s an outstanding player.”With Castleford ahead by only six at half-time it was the teenager’s inidual brilliance which took this game away from Leeds – namely two stunning tries of his own before two assists for Jesse Sene-Lefao’s brace.Leeds earlier led on two separate occasions, both times via tries for Tom Briscoe, before Castleford eventually forged a half-time lead courtesy of tries from Greg Eden, Quentin Laulu‑Togaga’e and Matt Cook.

Speaking to the  on Saturday the Frenchman reiterated that view saying: “It’s not just in cycling, that’s global justice. That’s democracy, you can’t prevent somebody from spending money on legal defence by capping it.”But Brailsford dismissed Lappartient’s position as a “cop-out”. Brailsford added: “Justice is justice and whether you are in the smallest team in the professional peloton or the biggest one, the justice and the rules that apply to you should be the same and fair. There should be no issue whatsoever there.“If you want to be the president of an international federation then protect everybody in that international community,” Brailsford said. “Don’t take a French angle or a nationalistic view on the international community. Protect the international community with no bias.“And I think he is still learning that really. The quicker he can get there, and learn what a president of an international federation’s responsibilities are, the better it will be for everybody.

A record crowd of 140,500 had duly arrived at the old airfield in fine spirits, anticipating their weekend would continue in a winning vein. But they and Hamilton were facing heartbreak by the end of lap one. That he managed to contain Vettel’s extension of his championship lead to eight points will have been of cold comfort.Hamilton made a poor start, being too aggressive as the lights went out and suffering from wheelspin, allowing Vettel and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who finished in fourth, to get past.Worse was to come. Räikkönen charged after him and, attempting to go up the inside into Village, the Finn locked up and his left front clipped the right rear of Hamilton’s Mercedes, sending the British driver into a spin and to the back of the field.Hamilton’s recovery drive was as good a comeback as any he has managed but it was not the record-breaking sixth win he had been hoping for and, with a Ferrari hitting a Mercedes for the second time in three races, he was far from happy.In France Vettel had clipped Bottas in turn one, damaging the Finn’s car for which the German received a five-second penalty. Here Räikkönen was given a 10-second penalty for “causing a collision” at turn three and Hamilton referred to the incidents collectively as “interesting tactics”, noting there had now been two races where Ferraris had “taken out” a Mercedes.His comments were given short shrift by Vettel and Räikkönen but Hamilton is within his rights to feel aggrieved that the penalties were not commensurate with how costly the incidents proved. But he also admitted the best way to avoid clashes was to ensure a clean getaway from the front of the grid and it was when the lights went out that he suffered the setback that left him battling Räikkönen.The fans, who had been chanting for their hero through the drivers’ parade, were left silenced and deflated as the scale of the task facing Hamilton became clear. But they were treated to what became a gripping encounter as Ferrari and Mercedes traded attack and defence to a thrilling climax.Bottas had clung as close as possible to Vettel out front but Hamilton was charging in their wake. The home crowd roared their approval every time Hamilton claimed a place back and they were kept in good voice – he had caught the top six by lap 10 although by then he was a full 27 seconds down on Vettel.Having passed the midfield, the real task was ahead. Hamilton pumped in a sequence of quick laps, staying out long on the soft rubber, and he was the last of the frontrunners to pit on lap 25 taking the medium tyres, emerging behind Räikkönen in sixth, 10 seconds back from the Finn.On lap 32 Marcus Ericsson crashed his Sauber at Abbey, bringing out the safety car, which allowed Hamilton to close up on the leaders. Ferrari, struggling with tyre wear, immediately pitted both their drivers for fresh rubber but Mercedes kept Hamilton and Bottas out, gaining track position.When racing resumed after six laps, Bottas led Vettel from Hamilton. It was finely poised but more drama was to follow. The race had barely restarted when Carlos Sainz and Romain Grosjean came together at Copse and the safety car was deployed again. Racing restarted on lap 42 and Vettel immediately charged at Bottas and they went wheel to wheel, the Finn defending brilliantly, as did Hamilton with Räikkönen snapping at his heels.With the two Mercedes on older rubber, the Ferraris had the edge and the sight of the four of them sweeping line-astern in a mighty battle through Silverstone’s glorious high-speed corners was breathtaking.It was Vettel, however, who ended on top and deservedly so. He finally retook the lead with a brilliant move up the inside of Bottas at Brooklands on lap 47. With the Finn struggling with a lack of grip on older rubber, Hamilton passed him for second a lap later, with Räikkönen then able to squeeze past for third.It was a denouement few could have expected and will be long-remembered even if it was not quite the conclusion the home crowd had really wanted.For Vettel it had been a major result for the Scuderia at a meeting Hamilton and Mercedes have won on the last four occasions. “We have struggled a lot here in the past,” Vettel said. “It was important for us to do well and to make the difference was great.”For Hamilton, despite the disappointment and his displeasure with Ferrari, he was able to take some satisfaction at minimising the damage. “To get back to second was huge for us,” he said. “I will take it, for us I’m happy with the drive and what the team were able to do.” He went to greet the fans as always but for the first time in five years it was a relatively muted, conciliatory affair after a race the world champion would doubtless sooner forget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4f1dc1d4e63cc78e4ee6b5ea817859b12c22f0/513_134_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77fecaccbe095be17594bb040eb7660","title":"fray bentos uruguay not just a meat pie","story":"The sleepy town was once home to the food brand that began in 1863 and the industrial landscape is now a world heritage siteIf you are lucky enough to reach the tiny Uruguayan town of Carmelo on a summer evening, you can cycle through tranquil vineyards, past lavender bushes and a yellow chapel glowing in the fading sunset to the Italian social club for dinner. Founded in the 1930s, very little has changed since then. Lo Korrea still serves the cheap, hearty food Italian farmers devoured after a day harvesting grapes on Saturday nights and sometimes Sunday lunch. The food is unrepentantly old-fashioned, heavy in cream and sugar, and the prices are, too – just under £12 for wine and three courses. On the evening we went there was a 60th wedding anniversary, with music seeping through a wall into the annex where we ate, and the odd child in a suit or frilly dress, eyes wide with sugar and excitement, wandering through the door.We ended up in Carmelo on our way to somewhere else even more improbable. Fray Bentos. Many people who recognise the name are astonished to find out that it is really a town, as opposed to the British brand of canned meat products, originally corned beef and then ready-made pies. It’s actually both. The sleepy, charming riverside town in Uruguay, was also home to the Fray Bentos brand which began in 1863 in a sprawling factory. In its heyday this cathedral of the industrial age, built along the town’s lush riverbank, fed half the world, churning out corned and frozen beef to fuel wars and the rise of empires. It played such a role in the transformation of how we eat worldwide, bringing meals into the industrial era, that three years ago Unesco declared the abandoned and ruined complex a world heritage site.When my Uruguayan godmother told me Fray Bentos was a place, not just a pie brand, we decided we had to visit this forgotten icon. The production lines have long since closed, the docks are decaying and it has fallen back into sleepy silence, disturbed only by tourists drawn to its strange and striking heritage. It is an unlikely holiday spot but a rewarding one, the quirky colonial charm of the town a perfect counterpoint to the stark remains of the factory, and if you tire of history there are beaches, ranches and one of Uruguay’s most unusual and relaxing wine areas just a short drive away.According to local legend, Fray Bentos was named after a shepherd who pointed travellers on their way. His legacy has been picked up by the locals who guide visitors through the sprawling factory complex, paved with iron to withstand the weight of thousands of cattle. There is a strange beauty in parts, particularly the turbine hall. A checkerboard marble floor (the stone was chosen in the 1920s for insulation), vast wheels arching towards the vaulted ceiling, frozen by time and rust, and sunbeams picking out the dust motes in the silent air give it something of the feel of an abandoned temple.There is even an inner sanctum, a control room of practical luxury, panels adorned with intricate metal-work and more marble, where engineers tended to the mysteries that kept the wheels turning. The plant was founded by a German inventor whose “meat extract” a liquid precursor to Oxo, needed vast quantities of beef, so he came to Uruguay where cows were plentiful and cheap. In the 1920s a British company bought the firm, giving it its local nickname, El Anglo. The town’s name became a byword for corned beef. Meat from Fray Bentos fed troops in both world wars, and British troops even nicknamed one tank Fray Bentos, a dark joke about a crew that were little more than minced meat in a can.A small museum tells the plant’s history and features curiosities such as a two-headed calf and Uruguay’s first lightbulb. When the tour finishes you can mull over the cycles of wealth and decline that played out here, the dawn of globalisation before the word was even coined, over lunch at La Chimenea, on a riverside terrace built over the plant’s former water pumping station, with a view clear across to Argentina. Inside, wood burns to charcoal in a hearth several metres wide, to grill the parrillada (barbecue) of perfectly seared meats (and a few vegetables if you insist) – a Uruguayan national passion. The owners are so friendly that when we found out they didn’t take cards, and we didn’t have enough cash, they told us just to put an envelope under the door later. It only serves lunch though, so save dinner for the town, a separate world from the factory complex with its villas, Anglo-Germanic sense of order, and probably the world’s only town-square monument to corned beef.Wealth seeped over into Fray Bentos, so the streets are adorned with strange and charming curiosities, such as the bandstand in the central square which is a copy of the one in Crystal Palace, a lavishly decorated theatre and rows of grand colonial homes, with high barred windows hiding inner courtyards from curious passersby. One has been turned into a hotel, the Posada del Frayle Bentos, whose sense of history has more or less survived a slightly brutal modernisation, with the addition of a plunge pool which offers a welcome chance to cool off on summer days. Locals stroll around to relax, or drive excruciatingly slowly up and down the riverfront. “It’s a small town – if we drove fast we’d be at the other end too quickly,” one explained.You can get a simple dinner and a drink with a view at Cervecería Hoffman. Save dessert for ice-creams at Heladeria Deleite, where they have five or six variations on dulce de leche – the creamy caramel that is a national obsession. If you fancy some exercise after that, there is a nine-hole golf course designed for El Anglo executives by the famous course architect Alister MacKenzie and recently refurbished for the top brass of a new factory complex upriver. Its open to visitors, although don’t expect golf carts or Trumpian flourishes of luxury.We had come to Fray Bentos through Carmelo, the most northern terminal for ferries from Buenos Aires, and somewhere else with a delicious sense of forgotten time and place. The streets were as empty as a town in a Gabriel García Márquez novel, during siesta, or after a cataclysm. The old wine district of Colonia Estrella is just 15 minutes by bike from Carmelo, across pancake-flat fields and empty roads, where we stayed at a lodge and boutique winery, Campo Tinto. The star grape in the region is an unusual variety called tannat, which grows well in Uruguayan soil and has become the country’s calling card, like Malbec for neighbouring Argentina. Campo Tinto also has a viognier and a special Uruguayan blend – medio y medio – a kind of sparkling semi-sweet rosé, a tribute to a cocktail popular with port workers in Montevideo and perfect for summer afternoons.• Most of the hotels in Carmelo offer bicycles with the room, or rent them out for a nominal fee, and it is a wonderful place to cycle, almost pancake flat, with wide, largely empty roads.• Cars can be rented from Marino Sport, who are very flexible on pick up and drop-off locations, and will come to you for a small fee.• Or there are buses from Carmelo to Fray Bentos twice daily. Book here.• Most of Fray Bentos is walkable, or the hotel can help you find taxis. • Entrevinas is a romantic cabin for two, set among the Bodega Cordana vineyards in the mornings breakfast will be left in a basket on the porch, otherwise you will be undisturbed.• Campo Tinto has an excellent restaurant and small swimming pool to enjoy, along with the wines.Fly to Buenos Aires with British Airways or Iberia, then get a ferry to Carmelo with Cacciola Viajes.

Eldorado was meant to be the new EastEnders – but 25 years since it was axed, it’s still a byword for disasterKai Maurer didn’t know that bleaching his hair would change his life. It was 1992 and the 18-year-old German was bumming around in southern Spain, searching for sun and all the other Ss. He dyed his long brown hair blond for a bet.Next thing he knew, a British TV production was looking to cast a young, blond German for some filming they were doing in the area. Kai went along. He hadn’t really done any acting before, but he’d played the trumpet as a kid, he’d been on a stage. And the audition went well, he got the part. In Eldorado. “I had no idea what anyone was talking about,” Maurer tells me today, over a quarter of a century on. “They were all going, ‘This is for the BBC, it’s going to be big like EastEnders, do you have any inkling how big?’ And I said, ‘No idea. I don’t even know what the BBC is.’”Eldorado’s final episode was broadcast 25 years ago this week. Today the soap opera, said to have cost the BBC £10m, is synonymous with extravagant fiasco. As in, be careful, it could all go Eldorado or we might have an Eldorado on our hands. The BBC hasn’t commissioned an open-ended soap since.It started so hopefully. The early 90s saw peak ratings cold war between the superpowers. ITV had Coronation Street and Emmerdale, the BBC just EastEnders. With the government breathing down its neck, the Beeb needed to add a cruise missile to its arsenal, in order to increase its market share, justify the licence fee, and perhaps its very existence. There was a competition, and a winner: EastEnders creator Tony Holland’s idea about expat Brits living in Spain. It had the key ingredients of a good soap: a sense of real community, of claustrophobia and isolation. There would be Germans and Scandinavians around the place, but it would centre on the Brits who brought their country with them. Little England was the original name. Tony Jordan, then a rookie writer on EastEnders, was brought in by Holland: he wrote Eldorado’s very first episode. Jordan remembers the hype growing until “at some point the commercial people started thinking, ‘Hang on, we’re part of Europe now, this could be the first Eurosoap, that could play not just in the UK but all over Europe.’ It became bastardised, those other nationalities were not on the periphery, they were in the centre. You had all these people tying themselves in knots in this kind of Europudding.”Jordan also talks about the terrible rush. Transmission was dragged forward to throw a curveball at ITV. The entire village they were building in Spain at a cost of £2m was hardly ready casting was rushed. As well as established actors, unknowns were hired – people like Kai Maurer. It couldn’t be called Little England any more, so it became Eldorado. The first episode aired on 6 July 1992 – and it was awful.The critics hated it. ’s Nancy Banks-Smith said it had “the look of a situation comedy whose laughter track has been lost” and wished for a tidal wave to wash the whole thing away. The punters hated it, too. The first episode had an audience appreciation index of 37, among the worst in memory. They’d hoped for 10 million viewers, but by the end of the first month the Friday episode (Eldorado originally went out three times a week) got just 2.8 million – fewer than Panorama. A year later the show that was supposed to save the Beeb’s ass was axed. Brake thinks the show was too ambitious, that it should have started more gently. But soon it was going out five times a week. “We were told we would have siestas in the afternoon, because we were terribly hot, and I remember one cameraman falling over because they were working so hard in the great heat.”She wasn’t convinced by the policy of hiring unknowns. “Some of the casting was unbelievably bad, considering how much talent we have in this country,” she says. Brake, who had worked with the RSC alongside Judi Dench and Ian Richardson, was now starring with Kai the German beach bum. Hey, he had been on stage, too, remember, even if it was only to blow his trumpet. Actually, if you look back at Eldorado now Kai is by no means the worst.Kai’s lines were in English. Some of the other actors spoke their own languages – Spanish, Swedish, Danish – which might have been authentic but also meant that most viewers didn’t know what the hell they were saying. Subtitles were added later, though a primetime popular audience wasn’t ready for them in the early 90s. “I think it may well have been ahead of its time,” says Kai. “Multiculturalism, there you have it, God knows how many different European nationalities under one roof.”Even the English bits weren’t always easy to understand – the sound quality was terrible. It turned out that a very expensive, purpose-built Spanish village had very echoey acoustics. The set still stands on the Costa Del Sol it’s used for paintballing. In spite of the stick it was getting, everyone I speak to who worked on it has fond memories of Eldorado. It might have been hard work, and not very good, but it was a lot of fun. Derek Martin, who played a gangster with a yacht, says the drive to work from his villa in the village of Mijas to the set, was the best he’s ever done. “We were all sad that it packed in,” he says. “The reason was because Mr Alan Yentob went to BBC One. If it had failed, it would’ve been his baby. But at the time it was shut down, it was getting eight million viewers. That should’ve been a licence to go again.”Eight million in 1993, when most viewers had a choice of four channels, wasn’t as many as eight million is today, but it’s a lot more than 2.8 million. A new producer had been brought in, new actors hired, some of the worst non-actors fired Eldorado had, to some extent, been turned around. Now it wasn’t really really bad, just not very good. And not very good wasn’t good enough for the new head of BBC One.So what does Yentob, who inherited Eldorado from his predecessor Jonathan Powell, have to say for himself? “There had been chaos up there, problems on the set, a change of producer, lots of things weren’t working. We saw costs not coming down, and I had other things in mind that would have been difficult to achieve given the investment in Eldorado.” Plus it was awful? “It was, and there you are. But when people are losing their jobs, it’s difficult to be that negative. I gave it a bit of a chance for a few weeks, looked at whether it was potentially going to get better. But, despite the fact it had a good producer, she couldn’t rehabilitate it, so, yes, I cancelled it.” Nancy’s tidal wave had finally arrived, in the form of Alan Yentob. Protests ensued from angry fans. “The stick has not stopped,” Yentob says. “People have been campaigning for it to be revived for such a long time. I’m sure people are sticking pins into pictures of me day and night. Which they are anyway.”Martin, who went on to play Charlie Slater in EastEnders, has heard rumours of an Eldorado reprisal. Now 85, would he go back? “Right now, this minute.”For Brake, just 76, it might not have been the long-term, mortgage-busting job she’d hoped it was going to be. “I think it was the end of my career really. Everything I’m proud of I did before.” But she’s not bitter it worked out well for her personally. If she’d stayed in Spain, she wouldn’t have met her husband. As for Maurer, it was something of a beginning. “I did it the wrong way round didn’t I?” he laughs. “I then went to the UK and I studied acting. I thought, ‘Right, I’m going to see what this is all about, see if I can improve anything.’ What has improved is I don’t sound German any more.”Not as German anyway. The acting lasted a while, but he found the only parts he was getting were comedy Germans or Nazis. He got tired of trying to impress casting directors: it was never as easy as it was that first time in Spain. He stayed in Britain, but changed career. Twenty-five years after the sun went down on Eldorado, Kai’s a flying instructor at Rochester airport, overlooking the River Medway in Kent.Oh and Jordan, who went on to become one of the biggest names in television writing, thinks it would be a good idea to bring it back. “Drama is a very crowded space,” he says. “We’re constantly looking for things that will make a noise, bring in an audience. If there was a broadcaster brave enough and smart enough to do a version of Eldorado, they’d get an immediate audience, though to keep them they’d have to give them a good show.” Over to you, broadcasters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch.

Let’s get to grips with the major stories unfolding this Monday morning, of which there are several.David Davis has resigned as Brexit secretary overnight after tensions in the government reached breaking point at the weekend. This morning there is speculation of a leadership contest, with Theresa May under siege from Eurosceptics after she won cabinet endorsement at a Chequers summit for her vision of a soft Brexit. The reaction to Davis’s departure has been intense through the night and we are continuing to cover it live – here is a summary of what we know so far.May’s plans involve a “facilitated customs arrangement” intended to remove the need for a hard border in Ireland, and the creation of a UK-EU free-trade area, in which the UK would abide by a “common rule book” of EU regulations. While accepted by many, including key leaver Michael Gove, it has incensed hardline Brexiters who see it as a harbinger of capitulation to Brussels. There is talk of names being gathered for a vote of no confidence in the PM. In a fairly scathing resignation letter, Davis said he was quitting rather than stay as a “reluctant conscript” to May’s plan.May is set to meet the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers this evening where she will try to stare down angry Eurosceptic Conservative MPs. Beforehand she will defend her plan in the Commons: “In the two years since the referendum result we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing round the cabinet table as they have on breakfast tables up and down our country. Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.”Thai jubilation – Four boys have been freed from the floodbound caves of Mae Sai and the rescue operation is set to continue today if conditions permit. There are pictures from the moments the first boys came out and were whisked away to hospital.To bring out the other eight, plus their coach, large stockpiles of air tanks and other equipment will need to have been replenished at the cave site, while the 90 ers who took part in yesterday’s eight-hour rescue will also need to have rested. We are, of course, continuing to cover this extraordinary situation live.Novichok kills woman – Wiltshire woman Dawn Sturgess has died from exposure to the novichok nerve agent. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, remains critically ill in Salisbury district hospital after they apparently handled an item contaminated with the substance. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said on Sunday night: “This is shocking and tragic news. Dawn leaves behind her family, including three children.” In Salisbury the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the “exact same nerve agent” as used against Sergei and Yulia Skripal. “We know back in March that it was the Russians. We know it was a barbaric, inhuman act by the Russian state. Again, for this particular incident, we need to learn more and let the police do their work.”Trump’s (un)welcome mat – Police are to mobilise in numbers not seen since the 2011 London riots when Donald Trump arrives on Thursday. Anti-Trump groups have promised a “carnival of resistance” and Matthew D’Ancona says it is fitting: “Shame on the prime minister for allowing this trip to go ahead.” Before leaving the US, Trump tonight will name the country’s next supreme court judge. The shortlist reportedly consists of federal appeals court judges Amy Coney Barrett, Thomas Hardiman, Brett Kavanaugh and Raymond Kethledge. Any one of them could tip the balance of the nine-person court toward conservatives and revisit landmark rulings on abortion access, racial discrimination, gay rights and other issues. The Senate confirmation process could be drawn out and ugly, with a multimillion dollar advertising war under way urging citizens to pile pressure on senators through phone calls, emails and protests.When your number’s up – It’s the blood test you might not want to have. Scientists have devised a way of estimating how long you have left to live. It is based on telltale markers in the blood that show how old the body seems from the way it functions, rather than how long it has been out of the womb. Medical researchers call this our “phenotypic age”. With the results in hand, doctors might be able to see what is contributing most to a person’s rate of ageing and suggest lifestyle changes that could reduce it. “Maybe you’re 65 years old but physiologically you look more like a 70 year old, so your mortality risk is more like that of a 70 year old,” explains Morgan Levine, from Yale University., Facebook and your data – We have been at the forefront of exposing the abuse of online personal data by the likes of Cambridge Analytica.

Captain Harry Kane insists England’s ambitions will not be satisfied by a first appearance in a World Cup semi-final for 28 years and that “finishing the job” is the target in Russia. Standing in their way are Croatia, who can boast a masterful midfield and variety up front but England will be buoyed by the side’s frailties.France meet Belgium in the first semi-final, with subplots aplenty, not least that of Thierry Henry, the Belgium coach thrust into the position of trying to help those players defeat the country of his birth, for whom he won 123 caps, not to mention a World Cup and European Championship.

Because it can’t. Nothing can, other than a dedicated approach, whether that’s therapy or medication, or whatever.” For Pegg, he “woke up in the Priory” after his wife had had enough. “I went into AA for a while, too … I don’t think it’s cool, like I was Mr Rock’n’roll, blackout and all that shit. It wasn’t, it was just terrible.” There’s more, including Pegg’s thoughts on Tom Cruise’s Scientology, in a revealing interview with Tim Jonze.

Photograph: Getty Images\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            The statement comes after a protest last week in Macroom (above), Co Cork, where members of Unite’s archaeology branch voiced concerns about pay rates on the bypass at the town. File photograph: Google Street ViewThe Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland (IAI) says it is willing to to act as a mediator between parties involved in recent industrial disputes in the sector.In a statement the IAI said “appropriate remuneration and working conditions are a necessity”, and it called for recognition of the qualifications and professional work done by archaeologists.The institute said it hoped the ongoing dialogue between commercial sector employers and the Unite trade union“will be fruitful and bring archaeology to equivalence with other areas of the construction sector”.The statement comes after a protest last week in Macroom, Co Cork, where members of Unite’s archaeology branch voiced concerns about pay rates on the bypass at the town. They said it was the first time archaeologists in Ireland had left a site to protest about pay since the 1970s.The Unite union say that Irish Archaeological Consultancy (IAC), which has been contracted to carry out archaeological works on the Macroom bypass, has refused to engage with them on their pay claim. The union says the IAC also refuses to engage with the Workplace Relations Commission.Unite’s Muiris Wade said there was a huge amount of frustration about pay in the industry, with archaeologists earning close to the minimum wage.“This whole event is a build up of years of running into walls. It is one of those professions where 100 per cent of people who are doing it love the job.” But “you can find yourself working in an environment where you don’t feel valued. It can be hard to make ends meet.”. He said the pay scale in the industry did not take the love out of the work but it “makes it hard for you to remember you love it”. Stuart Elder, who works on the Macroom bypass as a site director, said the situation was insulting to the profession.Mr Elder, who moved to Ireland from Lancashire over 20 years ago, said they had tried and failed to get companies to agree to minimum pay levels.Labour’s employment spokesman Senator Ged Nash said “IAC must show respect to their workers, many of whom hold postgraduate qualifications and have considerable experience yet are expected to live on just €12.50 an hour.”The former minister of state added: “The firm must engage with the union, and Minister Ross and his Government colleagues must make it clear that companies in receipt of State contracts must be expected to engage with our industrial relations institutions.” In a statement IAC said it deals directly with staff on contractual matters.“Earlier this spring the trade union Unite circulated a letter throughout the commercial archaeology sector seeking additional increases in payrates.“IAC have been offering salary packages on projects at or up to 4 per cent above those rates. IAC communicated this position to the WRC on May 11th this year.”The Macroom bypass involves the building of a 22km dual-carriageway from Coolcower to Ballyvourney."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558391.1531121990!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis resignation former brexit secretary says he was very clear he did not back may s plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary David Davis who has resigned from the government. File photograph: Ian ForsythPA WireDavid Davis has resigned as Brexit secretary in a major blow to British prime minister Theresa May. Ms May will appoint a new Brexit secretary on Monday morning following the resignation of Mr Davis late on Sunday night, along with junior Brexit minister Steve Baker. The prime minister is due to update the House of Commons this afternoon on the Brexit strategy agreed by the cabinet at Chequers last Friday and to address the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers this evening.In his letter of resignation, Mr Davis told Ms May that the deal agreed at Chequers meant that Britain was now unlikely to leave the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU.Mr Davis said he was “very clear” on Friday that he did not back Theresa May’s Brexit plan and said he told the Prime Minister he would be the “odd man out” on it.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, Mr Davis said: “When we debated this at Cabinet on Friday my opening remark to Theresa was ‘Prime Minister, as you know I’m going to be the odd-man-out in this’. She knew this because I had written to her earlier in the week.“Cabinet collective responsibility applied so I didn’t say anything thereafter. That was because I was thinking about the consequences.“I took the view at the time this was not the best strategy, that there were better strategies available — we have been establishing them.“I thought it would be a risk at least of delivering a poor outcome. I was very clear on Friday and I took two days to think through some, for me, very important decisions.”He also said he believes Theresa May is a “good prime minister” and insisted “oh yes, of course” she can survive as leader.In his letter of resignation, Mr Davis said:“In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real. As I said at Cabinet, the “common rule book” policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense. I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions,” he said. Ms May had been hoping to win over Brexiteers after a backlash against her plans for leaving the EU. Mr Davis, who signed up to the plan agreed by the cabinet at Chequers last Friday has left the cabinet with immediate effect.His exit may embolden Brexiteer backbenchers who have concerns about Mrs May’s leadership. The move, late last night, came just as May faces a major test in the House of Commons today and then a potentially stormy meeting of Tory MPs and peers. Mrs May is expected to tell MPs that the strategy agreed at Chequers is the “right Brexit” for Britain.In her response, the prime minister said she disagreed with Mr Davis’s characterisation of the Chequers deal, which she described as a “precise, responsible and credible” approach to the negotiations.“I am sorry that the Government will not have the benefit of your continued expertise and counsel as we secure this deal and complete the process of leaving the EU, but I would like to thank you warmly for everything you have done over the past two years as Secretary of State to shape our departure from the EU, and the new role the UK will forge on the world stage as an independent, self-governing nation once again,” she said.Last night British Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: “This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left. “He said Ms May was in office but not in power. “ She cannot deliver Brexit, and our country is at a complete standstill. We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning government.”Reacting to news of Mr Davis’s resignation late last night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “We’ll see how things develop. As far as I am concerned, when Theresa May speaks she speaks for the UK government and that’s the basis I’ll be working on.”He gave a cautious welcome to the deal agreed by the British cabinet, which he hailed as a “real political success” for Ms May.In his first public comments since the UK cabinet agreed the new approach last Friday – which moves Britain towards a so-called soft Brexit – Mr Varadkar said he was more optimistic than before that an EU-UK exit deal could be struck by the end of the year. However, the Taoiseach said he had “some concerns about the workability of the UK’s customs” proposals and the plan’s effect on the integrity of the single market. The new approach envisages a new UK-EU customs area, although Britain could apply different tariffs from the EU. It would also align Britain to the European Single Market for goods, while moving away from it for services. Mr Varadkar was speaking after talks in Dublin Castle with Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian Chancellor, to coincide with Austria assuming the six- month presidency of the European Council. Both leaders stressed the integrity of the single market, which commits members to free movement of goods, services, capital and people. “The position from the EU, and a position I support, is that you are either in the single market or you’re not,” Mr Varadkar said. “The single market has four freedoms: of movement when it comes to goods when it comes to labour when it comes to services and when it comes to capital, and we’ve said in our guidelines that those are inisible.”While an exception could be made for the North, “an exception for the UK would be a very different order and the EU’s position is that the four freedoms with respect to the UK must go together,” he said. – Additional reporting: PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Speaking to Today, Ms Jenkyns said Mrs May’s time was up as prime minister and she wanted a Brexiteer to lead the country.“I think Theresa May’s premiership is over,” she said.“I want one who passionately believes in Brexit and will provide true leadership and a positive post-Brexit vision for our country,” she said.Opposition MPs were quick to raise the prospect of a general election as a result of the major blow for the prime minister.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.“With her government in chaos, if she clings on, it’s clear she’s more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: “With a Prime Minister incapable of holding her ministerial team together \u0026amp with such instability in government it’s impossible to see how EU leaders could take Theresa May seriously in the next round of negotiations.“It’s time for her \u0026amp her party to put country before party \u0026amp go.”Seema Malhotra, who sits on the Commons Brexit Select Committee, tweeted: “Will there be a domino effect?“It’s now not inconceivable that May is gone within days or weeks, the Tories are plunged into disarray and a general election called.”Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: “David Davis resignation now shows the Tory party is in complete disarray and not governing in the national interest.“This nonsense cannot continue, even the Tory spin doctors cannot surely spin a positive message out of this debacle, it’s time for the Tories to go #ToryFail”Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: “Government resignations since autumn: 1 November 2017 — Fallon 8 November 2017 — Patel 20 December 2017 - Green 29 April 2018 — Rudd 8 January 2018 — Greening 8 July 2018 — Davis There have been six resignations in 249 days. That’s one every six weeks.”The Liberal Democrats, who back a second referendum on Brexit, said on Twitter: “The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say on this shambolic Brexit with the chance to stay in the EU.”Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: “The #chequers unity didn’t last long. This UK government is in utter chaos and ebbing authority by the day. What a shambles.”Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Commons leader, tweeted: “It took the Tories two years to come up with a proposal and two days for it to fall apart!”Mr Davis’s departure was met with dismay from business leaders who had called for greater certainty over the Brexit process.Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said there had been “real rays of light” in the Cabinet agreement on Friday and described the resignation as a “blow”.She told Today: “This is a blow. One of the things that business welcomed on Friday was finally cabinet unity.“That inability to take decisions over several months had become a huge challenge in terms of uncertainty.”– Press Association"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558187.1531068809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory ministers move to quell revolt against chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEnvironment secretary Michael Gove, right, on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show, urging support for Theresa May. Photograph: Jeff OversBBCPA WireTheresa May’s ministers have moved to dampen a Conservative backbench revolt against a plan agreed at Chequers last Friday that would keep Britain closely aligned with the European Union after Brexit. Hardline Brexiteers have condemned the proposal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum vote, but environment secretary Michael Gove, who chaired the Vote Leave campaign, urged MPs to unite behind the prime minister.“Those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. The plan approved by the cabinet after an all-day meeting on Friday would see Britain maintaining full regulatory alignment with the EU for goods, including agri-foods. Parliament could decide to reject new EU regulations after Brexit, but the document acknowledges that such a move would “lead to consequences” for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border.Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen accused Brexiteer ministers of failing to stand up for their principles, accusing foreign secretary Boris Johnson, whose hero is Winston Churchill, of following the example of Neville Chamberlain. “I’m very, very disappointed with the offer that we’ve seen coming out of Chequers. I’m disappointed that so-called Brexiters in the cabinet didn’t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer,” Mr Bridgen told the BBC.Backbench Brexiteers will have an opportunity to express their outrage directly to the prime minister when she addresses the 1922 Committee at Westminster on Monday. Mr Gove, whose intervention at Chequers in support of the prime minister was reported to have swayed other ministers, said the proposal was the best available option.“I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t, make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the cabinet,” he said.“We achieved all of the things that we campaigned for in order to ensure we could leave the EU, but we also do so in a way which respects some of the wishes and some of the concerns of some of my colleagues that voted remain.”Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would not support the plan agreed at Chequers, describing it as an unworkable fudge and a bureaucratic nightmare. “She hasn’t met our demands. We’ve been clear you need a comprehensive customs union and you need a single market deal with shared institutions and shared regulations. She’s come up with a fudge on customs. It is a fudge and it’s going to unravel. She’s going to have to think again,” he said.“We’ve argued for a comprehensive customs union with the EU. In order to avoid that, the prime minister has gone to these extraordinary lengths to come up with this bureaucratic nightmare which is not going to work.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

I made that bitch famous\u0027Kim Kardashian releases of audio of Tayior Swift approving the lyrics to \u0027Famous\u0027The creation of the pop anthems Attwood references has been assisted via Swift’s collaboration with songwriters such as Max Martin, the Swedish savant who seems to have worked with just about every significant pop artist of the past two decades at some point.\u0026nbspBut you do wonder whether she isn’t in danger of losing something with the sound she’s adopted these days, of sacrificing the connection she made with her lyrics.\u0026nbspophidiophobic fan running for a therapist (PA)Before taking the plunge, I decided I was going to have to try her music on for size – don’t let anyone tell you journalism isn’t painful at times – having first fortified myself with an evening in the company of Ice T’s Body Count: “The people have had enough. Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If the Brexit Secretary cannot support them they cannot be very good proposalsHe is also said to have been annoyed after being sidelined in negotiations by Ms May’s civil servant Europe advisor\u0026nbspOlly\u0026nbspRobbins.But  correspondent Sarah O’Grady, the wife of Mr Davis’ special adviser Stewart Jackson, said “DD decided he couldn’t sell out his own country”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the Brexit-backing European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, said:\u0026nbsp“This is very important.“It raises the most serious questions about the PM’s ideas. If the Brexit secretary cannot support them they cannot be very good proposals.Turning his fire on the meeting at Chequers on Friday, he said: “It was an attempt to bounce the cabinet. It was a serious\u0026nbspmistake.”\u0026nbspBackbencher\u0026nbspPeter Bone also\u0026nbspsupported Mr Davis’ decision to quit, saying he had “done the right thing” and that it was a “principled and brave decision”.He added: “The PM’s proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.”Mr Baker, a key Tory figure in the Leave campaign, was Mr Davis’s\u0026nbspmain lieutenant\u0026nbspat Dexeu,\u0026nbspand was hailed as\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp”courageous and principled” by other Brexiteer Tories as he also left.\u0026nbspMs May is expected to tell MPs\u0026nbspat what may now become a critical meeting on Monday,\u0026nbspthat the strategy agreed on at Chequers is the “right Brexit” for Britain.Her plans would commit the UK to maintain a “common rule book” with the EU, meaning it would effectively seek to stay in a single market for goods, for the foreseeable future at least.The proposed facilitated customs arrangement, would see all imported goods charged the UK tariff at the border, with goods then tracked\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspif they were sent on to the continent, exporters would be charged the EU tariff with money passed on to Brussels.The plan means that the UK can theoretically sign trade deals with other countries in which it promises to lower tariffs on goods, in return for preferable access for its services. But the promise not to deviate from EU standards on goods, means a change to regulations could not form a part of any trade deal – something which has angered Brexiteers.Some Conservatives\u0026nbsptold The Independent they believed there could be enough disgruntled MPs willing to trigger a leadership contest in a bid to remove Ms May.But even if the 48 needed to oust Ms May materialised, a poll for The Independent showed a majority of the public would expect a general election to be called if Ms May goes.Labour’s shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: “David Davis resignation now shows the Tory party is in complete disarray and not governing in the national interest.“This nonsense cannot continue, even the Tory spin doctors cannot surely spin a positive message out of this debacle.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Downing Street are expected to announce later this morning.Speaking on LBC Radio just now, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think a no-confidence vote is immediately in the offing.I think what the prime minister needs to do is give up on the Chequers proposals which, David Davis has pointed out in his resignation letter, don\u0027t actually deliver Brexit.He says he will congratulate Davis for resigning and shows what the PM is offering isn\u0027t really\u0026nbspHe says he has not personally sent a letter of no confidence in the PM to the 1922 Committee.\u0026nbspSpeaking on Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Mr Davis denied weakening the prime minster, saying:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt is one day, she has got to have a Brexit Secretary who will deliver on her strategy.That is not weakening, that is actually enhancing the effectiveness of the strategy.He said he wanted to speak to Ms May face to face on Sunday night but had spoken to her by telephone as she was at her home in Sonning, Berkshire.He added: I like Theresa May, I think she is a good PM. We have a difference over this strategy.He said other cabinet members had asked for changes to be made to the Brexit policy on Friday, but none had been made.He admitted he had lost the argument in cabinet, adding: In my view, this policy has got a number of weaknesses.I would be front and centre in delivering this policy, explaining it to the House, persuading the House it is right, and then going out and delivering it with the EU.Frankly, just as it was known what the policy was, it was also known I had concerns about it.It would not have been a plausible thing to do and I wouldn\u0027t have done a good job at it.David Davis\u0027 resignation letter in fullDear Prime Minister,\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAs you know there have been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line, ranging from accepting\u0026nbsp the Commission’s sequencing of negotiations through to the language on Northern Ireland in the December Joint Report.\u0026nbspAt each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspI am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.\u0026nbsp Whether it is the progressive dilution of what I thought was a firm Chequers agreement in February on right to erge, or the unnecessary delays of the start of the White Paper, or the presentation of a backstop proposal that omitted the strict conditions that I requested and believed that we had agreed, the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem.\u0026nbspIn my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real.\u0026nbsp As I said at Cabinet, the “common rule book” policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOf course this is a complex area of judgement and it is possible that you are right and I am wrong.\u0026nbsp However, even in that event it seems to me that the national interest requires a Secretary of State in my Department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript.\u0026nbsp While I have been grateful to you for the opportunity to serve, it is with great regret that I tender my resignation from the Cabinet with immediate effect.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp Yours ever, David DavisEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesResidents look over the flooded town by heavy rain in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture, western Japan.

The demand is likely to cause friction with Italy’s European partners where migration is a source of internal political tension.Last week, Germany, Austria and Italy said they would hold talks in Innsbruck about how to shut down the Mediterranean route.Germany wants to process refugees in police facilities within 48 hours on its southern border with Austria, and in turn Austria has said it may be forced to protect its own southern border with Italy and Slovenia to stop migrants transiting from the south.Italy’s transport ministry last month said it wanted the EU border agency, Frontex, to stop working in the Mediterranean. Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

May delivers brilliant response to sceptic Brexiteer on free movement                \u0026lsquoFree movement to END\u0026rsquo May vows as she braces for Brexit backlashOver that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit, she will tell MPs.She will stress her plan means leaving the EU on March 29 next year, a complete end to freedom of movement, restoring the supremacy of British courts, no more vast sums of money would be sent to Brussels, instead a Brexit idend to spend on domestic priorities like our long-term plan for the NHS.The plan also made for frictionless trade in goods, flexibility on services, no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The UK will have a \u0026lsquolock\u0026rsquo on any new EU rules, while there were commitments to maintain high standards on consumer, working and environmental rights while leaving the Commons Agricultural and Fisheries Policy.Meanwhile, Britain would have the freedom to strike new trade deals around the world, she will say, stressing bluntly that people are wrong to say that is not the case.The UK will also have an independent foreign and defence policy but with continued security cooperation to keep people safe.Mrs May will insist it is \u0027the right Brexit deal\u0027This is the Brexit that is in our national interest, she will declare.It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people.Conservative MPs were invited into Downing Street all weekend to be briefed by Chief whip Julian Smith and Mrs May\u0027s aides about the deal.A source said: We are saying let us explain the thinking behind this, and why it\u0027s a good deal for Britain that doesn\u0027t breach our manifesto commitments or our red lines and does allow us to trade with other countries and protect the border and jobs.We have the Cabinet behind it and now we want to get the party and the country behind it.A White Paper with full details of what Britain will put to Brussels is due on Thursday.So far the Government has said it entails a free trade area for goods and a common rule book for industrial and agricultural products with the power for Parliament to reject new EU rules.UK courts will pay due regard to EU court rulings on trade.It also promises the UK will have an independent trade policy, leave the Common Agriculture and Fisheries Policies, end free movement and stop paying huge amounts to the EU each year.Mr Gove admitted the compromise was not all he hoped for but then I\u0027m a realist.All those of us who believe we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the Prime Minister in order to negotiate that deal.In a choreographed move, Cabinet ministers penned articles for Sunday newspapers backing the Chequers deal.In some cases a pro-Brexit minister was paired with a more Remain-minded colleague to underline government unity and win over critics on both sides.A joint column by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit-backing Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: What was agreed at Chequers on Friday night is a pragmatic as well as a principled Brexit deal, one that works for both the EU and the UK.Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Chequers plan had fudge written all over it. It\u0027s unworkable, it\u0027s a bureaucratic nightmare.Mr Gove admitted the compromise was not all he hoped forHe added that Labour would not take the option of backing a referendum on the final deal off the table if Parliament voted down the agreement or the UK failed to reach agreement with Brussels.Labour peer and former EU Commissioner Lord Mandelson said the party should explicitly commit to a second vote and put the economy first.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis said: We\u0027re moving forward, and Labour want to turn the clock back two years.Mrs May told the Sunday Times it was time for the EU to get serious and address what we\u0027ve put forward.She said the EU Commission which is leading talks with Britain had so far been very much holding fast to a rigid approach but other leaders like Angela Merkel were beginning to ask about what mattered for their own people.Dismissing talk of a looming leadership challenge from angry Tories, she declared: The only challenge that needs to be made now is to the EU to get serious about this, to come round the table and discuss it with us.Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who chaired the Vote Leave referendum campaign and is a focus of Tory anger for supporting the Chequers deal, backed her call, saying Brussels will make a no-deal Brexit more likely if it does not show more willing.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersAgreement on Friday that the Government should do more to prepare for a no-deal outcome was one concession secured by Brexiteers - and Mr Gove was said to have emphasised the point in his own decisive presentation to colleagues making clear he would back Mrs May\u0027s approach.He told BBC One\u0027s Andrew Marr show yesterday: We\u0027re being generous towards the EU, we\u0027re showing flexibility.If the EU is ungenerous and inflexible then we may have to contemplate walking away without a deal.One of the things that we agreed at Chequers is that we would step up the preparations for precisely that outcome to ensure that ... we will be in a position in March 2019 that if we don\u0027t get the deal that we want, to be able to walk away.Noone wants to walk away now because we\u0027re in the middle of a negotiation. What we need to do is to be able to walk away in March 2019 (but) not because we want that outcome. I want a deal.He advised EU negotiator Michel Barnier to regard the interests of your citizens with the same care and the same attention as our Prime Minister has for the interests of our citizens and work for a good trade agreement.One source stressed last night: The free trade agreement we\u0027re proposing isn\u0027t about compromise with the EU, it\u0027s about challenging them. They won\u0027t find this easy to accept. It\u0027s going to be a negotiation.---------------------Comment by Rt. Hon. John Redwood MPChequers reinforced the message that the UK is preparing for no deal with the EU, and will be ready to leave without one next March 29 if necessary.The Cabinet confirmed the red lines.The European Court of Justice will no longer have power over us.Freedom of movement will end and the UK will control her borders.The UK will make her own deals and trade freely globally.I agree with all that.The problem lies in the more detailed parts. The statement did not explain how we can have our own trade policy and sign free trade deals if we enter a customs partnership with the EU and if they control many of our laws.It did not reconcile the promise that ECJ power ends with vague statements about the need to refer to the ECJ over goods and trade.If UK courts have to reflect ECJ judgements we are not independent.It did not explain why the UK should collect tariffs for EU countries when they will not do so for us.Or how you can run parallel customs duties in our market without cost and complexity.The EU is unlikely to accept the current proposal unamended.They insist that the only way to be independent is to leave the single market and customs union.That has always been and remains UK government policy which I support.I want the Government to offer the EU a free trade agreement, the best way to carry on tariff and barrier-free whilst regaining control of trade and laws.Failing that No Deal gives us what we want to restore our democracy, and WTO rules will take care of our EU trade as they do our non-EU trade today.\u0026bull John Redwood is Conservative MP for Wokingham."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/985701_1.jpg","title":"David Davis resignation Theresa May Brexit news Chequers summit praised Tory MPs","story":"Wellingborough MP Peter Bone tweeted his support for the resignation, saying: \u0026ldquoDavid Davis has done the right thing, a principled and brave decision.\u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister\u0026rsquos proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.Andrea Jenkyns, who quit a junior government role earlier this year to fight for Brexit, added: \u0026ldquoFantastic news.

What happened and why did he quit?Mr Davis, 68, was born in York to a single mother and was initially brought up by his grandparents.When his mother re-married the family moved to south London, living in a deprived part of Wandsworth before moving to a council estate in Tooting.He completed a BSc in computer science at Warwick University before studying a London Business School and Harvard.Aged 38, he was first elected to parliament in 1987 as MP for Boothferry - which later became his current constituency Haltemprice and Howden.In 1992, he was a government whip who worked on pushing through the Maastricht treaty, which led to the euro and greater integration of the European Union.He twice stood for Conservative party leader in 2001 and 2005 but was beaten to the post by Iain Duncan Smith then David Cameron.His poor performance at the Conservative party conference was said to have cost him the second leadership bid and he and Cameron never got along as the Tories rose to power.Mr Davis triggered a by-election in 2008 following a row over civil liberties after new terror laws were passed allowing suspects to be detained without charge for 42 days.Despite getting re-elected he was sidelined for nearly a decade on the backbenches before returning to the cabinet in 2016 after Theresa May took office.Mr Davis married Doreen Davis in 1973, and they live together in a farmhouse in rural Yorkshire.They have three grown-up children and five grandchildren.David Davis announced his resignation minutes before midnight on July 8, 2018, with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposals would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He said there had been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line.He added that he had previously decided to toe the line and remain in the Cabinet because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.But in a damning verdict on the PMs approach, he wrote: I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.In her reply, Mrs May told him: I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed on at Cabinet on Friday.She said: I am sorry that you have chosen to leave the Government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful Brexit and when we are only eight months from the date set in law when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.Theresa May was left vulnerable after her snap election gamble backfiredMr Davis has been outspoken on a number of issues and in 2003 when he voiced his support of the death penalty for people convicted of murder where there is clear evidence and no doubt surrounding the offenders guilt.Five years later he distanced himself from the comments and said he did not want to restore the death penalty, but in a personal capacity agrees with the principal.In 2005, he was bizarrely forced to deny he was behind a stunt involving two blonde women with large breasts wearing Its DD for me t-shirts during his party leadership bid.But he did add that he felt people had a sense of humour failure over the issue.Earlier this year, he was slammed over leaked texts in which he said he would not hug Labour MP Diane Abbott because he is not blind.He apologised for any offence caused by the messages.Mr Davis was a high-profile Leave supporter and campaigner in the run-up to the EU referendum.He was asked to rejoin the cabinet as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.Downing Street sources say he won the trust of Mrs May and was seen as a safer pair of hands than other outspoken Leavers such as Boris Johnson and Liam Fox.He appears to have taken care not to talk out of line or become embroiled in public rows with colleagues over how Brexit will unfold.Laying out his Brexit plans, Mr Davis claimed the economy would feel the benefits even before Britains departure because of increased foreign investment.He said: Brexit will deliver the circumstances that allow us to pursue an unfettered high growth strategy.Mr Davis has urged business chiefs to stay with Britain following fears some companies may be tempted to move staff or manufacturing to other European countries.The Brexit Secretary emerged as a favourite to replace Theresa May – following a survey of Tory members.A study by academics published in July found more than a fifth, 21 per cent of Conservatives want the Brexit Secretary to take over from the ailing PM.Mr Davis has also previously played down the chances of a leadership challenge during Brexit negotiations.He said in June: “Let me be absolutely plain about this, number one I happen to think we have got a very good Prime Minister.There is no essay crisis about this government. It is very, very, very clear that she is a good Prime Minister."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000226508289.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"justin welby archbishop of canterbury royal wedding vows","story":"What else do we know about the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury?Justin Portal Welby worked for 11 years in the oil industry, five of which were for French oil company Elf Aquitaine in Paris.He became treasurer of the group Enterprise Oil plc in London before retiring in 1989.Welby said he sensed a calling from God to be ordained.He was rejected at first for ordination by John Hughes, the Bishop of Kensington, who said: There is no place for you in the Church of England.But he was later accepted by the Vicar of Holy Trinity Brompton, Sandy Millar.After training at Cranmer Hall and studying theology at St Johns College, Durham, he was ordained in 1992 as a deacon, and a priest in 1993.The Most Reverend Justin Welby has written widely on ethics and finance.He was made Bishop of Canterbury in 2013 after initially saying it was perfectly absurd for him to be appointed as he had been a bishop for a short amount of time.The Archbishop of Canterbury married Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.The Rt Rev David Conner, dean of Windsor, conducted the service at St Georges Chapel.But the pair made their vows in front of Justin Welby.Meghan was baptised into the Church of England and confirmed ahead of the wedding.Harry, 33, is the first senior royal in modern times to be granted a Church of England wedding despite marrying a divorced woman.The Archbishop of Canterbury said in a statement in November: I am so happy that Prince Harry and Ms Markle have chosen to make their vows before God.I wish them many years of love, happiness and fulfilment and ask that God blesses them throughout their married life together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

as are helicopters including the Puma, Chinook, Juno and Jupiter.Jets from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight - the Dakota, Lancaster, Hurricane and Spitfire - will also be taking part.They will be joined by the Hercules, Atlas A400M, C-17, BAe 146, Sentinel, Voyager, Shadow, Rivet Joint, E-3D Sentry, Tornado GR4, Typhoon and Red Arrows."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418634732-e1530906002440.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how many godparents christening","story":"Here we look at whether at how many a kid can have and what their rights are...Traditionally, Christian children have three godparents in total, though they can have as many as the parent wants.Girls have two godmothers and one godfather while boys have two godfathers and one godmother.Non-practising Christians can have as many or as few as they like, though it is customary to have at least one godfather and one godmother.Blood relatives and members of the family can be chosen to be the childs godparent.When a child is born parents will often turn to close family members or friends and ask them to be a godparent for their child.Traditionally, godparents were responsible for ensuring a childs religious education, according to Confetti.But in modern times, the individual is chosen by parents to take a general interest in the kids wellbeing and development.This is not a legal appointment and, should anything happen to the parents, godparents would not automatically become responsible for that child.Godparents play an important role in christenings, according to Church of England Christenings.In the christening service, you will make some big promises to support your godchild throughout their life, the website states.They often bring the infant to the font to be baptised and in countries such as Latvia, it is the godparents who also choose a name for the child."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412821186-e1528839431605.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"liam halligan brexit plans opinion","story":"If the plan is agreed, future historians will see this as the moment the Prime Minister belied her “Brexit means Brexit” mantra and crossed her own red lines — with full Cabinet support.These new proposals, driven by uber-Remain civil servants, would leave the UK in the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union in all but name.Bizarrely, Britain would also collect customs duties on the EU’s behalf, making an independent trade policy virtually impossible.The UK would be at the behest of EU rules with no influence in setting them and none of the advantages of escaping Brussels’ grasp.These plans are incoherent, economically disastrous and a fraud on the 17.4million people who backed Brexit, our biggest ever act of democracy.I’ve consistently argued for clean Brexit, with Britain leaving the Single Market and Customs Union altogether.If the Single Market is so good, why is our EU trade diminishing, in deficit and smaller than our trade beyond the EU?The US and China conduct hundreds of billions of dollars of EU trade without vast contributions or freedom of movement rules.The protectionist Customs Union, meanwhile, puts high tariffs on the 85 per cent of the world economy beyond the EU, making food, clothing and footwear — items on which poorer UK households spend heavily — much dearer.And, with conflicting EU member interests blocking free trade agreements with the US, China and other big economies, Britain can better secure such deals alone.In her Lancaster House speech and subsequent Article 50 letter, Theresa May backed clean Brexit.She then lost her nerve as well-funded Remainer lobbies dug in, agreeing a £39billion divorce bill with no guarantee of a trade deal, handing Brussels huge leverage. Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them.Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.And Mrs May’s legacy will be to usher in our first Marxist Government, bringing economic destruction on a scale beyond anyone’s experience.And Mrs May will rubbish fears that proposals for a common rulebook with the EU for goods will restrict Britain’s ability to strike new trade deals.But her plea for unity is unlikely to stop furious Tory MPs from accusing her of betraying voters who backed Brexit.A string of influential Eurosceptics have vowed to submit letters of no confidence as early as tonight if Mrs May fails to convince them that her new blueprint delivers on the referendum result.The PM’s carefully-constructed Chequers peace deal was at risk of unravelling on Sunday.There is growing uncertainty over the future of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as Brexit Secretary David Davis resigned on Sunday night.The pair refused to back Mrs May more than 48 hours after she unveiled the deal.Mrs May has repeatedly preferred the counsel and ideas of her civil servant, EU advisor Olly Robbins, over his — a humiliation no senior elected politician should have to take.David Davis’s fervent Brexiteer deputy at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, following him out of the door is also very significant, as it now resembles the beginning of a leadership coup. In the past eight months Theresa May has seen her FirstMinister, Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, Development Secretary and now Brexit Secretary all resign.Normally, Prime Ministers don’t survive that kind of severe and damaging blow to their political authorityCan this one? We will know by the end of this week.Allies of Mr Johnson defended his decision not to quit, saying it was “best to stay inside the tent fighting as there’s always the risk Brexit will get softer”.BoJo initially branded the soft Brexit plans “a big turd”. He joked that anyone defending them would be “polishing a turd” but later ditched his opposition and agreed to the proposals.Mr Davis rang the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Saturday night to talk him through the details of the deal before breaking his silence and resigning.Furious MPs have promised “robust exchanges” with Mrs May when they come face-to-face with her at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 committee tonight.Eurosceptic Andrea Jenkyns said she was “100 per cent” ready to sign a letter to party chiefs demanding a leadership contest if the PM’s proposals breach her previous Brexit red lines.Fellow Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said he would also submit a letter of no confidence.He told The Sun: “I wouldn’t support this deal if the EU were paying us.”Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “This is not what the British voted for.”And scores of MPs said they would vote down the final agreement if it mirrored the current Brexit package.One senior Tory reckoned that a no deal Brexit was now more likely, adding: “The Government has a serious question mark over getting this kind of deal through the Commons.”Michael Gove said Brexiteers had won a key concession from Cabinet Remainers to “step up” the Government’s no deal preparations that would allow Mrs May to “contemplate walking away” from negotiations with Brussels.The Environment Secretary, who led the Leave campaign but was the key power broker on Friday, escalated the Tory civil war by accusing hardline Brexiteers of “fake and mock outrage”.No10 also angered MPs by gagging them from speaking to the media until they’d been briefed by whips.Chief whip Julian Smith and the PM’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell held a frantic briefing session on Sunday and have scheduled a series of similar meetings throughout Monday to win over sceptical voices.A rival briefing paper put out by the leading pro-Brexit QC Martin Howe was circulated around Brexiteer MPs.On Sunday, before Mr Davis resignation, Mr Gove admitted that Mrs May’s Brexit plan wasn’t “everything you hope for”.But he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: “I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the Cabinet.”He added: “What we have done is to make a balanced decision. For 80 per cent of the economy we’ll be outside the EU’s regulatory orbit . . . and that provides a perfect balance.”Eight per cent were left undecided.A separate poll for the Mail on Sunday found 38 per cent of the public viewed Mrs May’s new proposals as a “sell-out”.It found the Tories have lost their lead over Labour. Jeremy Corbyn’s party leapfrogged the Tories and now lead by 40-38 per cent.Last night a member of the Cabinet said the PM planned to offer a major concession on immigration  to win a deal with Brussels.The unamed minister told The Times: “They are clearly going to compromise further.”In another blow for the PM, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he would join Jeremy Corbyns Labour party in voting against Mrs Mays Brexit deal if it mirrored her current proposals.And in a ominous warning to Mrs May, he suggested other Tory Eurosceptics would follow suit, which would threaten to defeat the Governments slender majority.Writing in todays Daily  Mr Rees-Mogg branded Mrs Mays claims that her Brexit deal complies with her red lines misfounded.He wrote: If the proposals are as they currently appear I will vote against them and others may well do the same”.In a statement to MPs on Monday, Mrs May will try to sell her Brexit proposals by saying: “In the two years since the referendum result we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing round the Cabinet table as they have on breakfast tables up and down our country.“Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated.

I like Theresa May, I think shes a good Prime Minister.And he slapped down colleagues who are trying to force Mrs May out, saying: “I won’t be encouraging people to do that. I think it’s the wrong thing to do.Latest updates on Theresa Mays political crisis:But he repeated his fierce criticism of her Chequers plan and warned the proposal would be watered down in talks by BrusselsMr Davis said: My fear is theyll take what weve offered already and then demand some more. Were giving too much away, too easily and thats a dangerous strategy.Hopefully we will resist very strongly any attempt to get any further concessions from us on this.And he dismissed claims by the Government that the proposal thrashed out at Chequers would give Parliament the right to cast off EU regulations in future, saying the freedom to diverge from Europes rules is illusory rather than real because doing would be fiercely resisted by Eurocrats.He also told the BBC he wouldnt demand the resignation of other ministers such as Boris Johnson, because people can only make these decisions of conscience, decisions of principle, by themselves in their own minds.Mr Davis insisted the reason he quit was because as Brexit Secretary hed be responsible for forcing Mrs Mays plans through the Commons, adding: Thats not a tenable position for somebody who believes in Brexit.But he hinted that at least half a dozen ministers had stood up to the PM at Chequers and said: Some people asked for some of the policies to be changed at the meeting, they werent.He added that he knew even before the Chequers summit that hed be unable to back Mrs May on the issue, calling himself the odd man out - but waited to hear the PM out and then discussed the issue with his wife over the weekend, before announcing he would quit late last night.In his resignation letter, Mr Davis said there had been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line.He added that he had previously decided to toe the line and remain in the Cabinet because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.But in a damning verdict on the PMs recent approach, he wrote: I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.The Prime Minister now faces a stormy meeting with Tory MPs and peers in Parliament this evening as she tries to keep her fragile administration together.Mrs May had hoped that the Cabinet agreement secured on Friday at Chequers would help her deliver the right Brexit for the UK, with an offer to Brussels to share a common rulebook on goods and form a new UK-EU free trade area.But Mr Davis, whose departure as Brexit Secretary also triggered the resignation of departmental ally Steve Baker with Suella Braverman said to be quitting too, lashed out at the proposals just 48 hours after being part of the Cabinet that agreed them.His letter rubbished Mrs Mays claim that her plan will give Parliament back control of laws illusory rather than real.And he said plans for a common rulebook with the EU for the trade of goods hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.And in a devastating final blow to the PM, he predicted that her negotiating approach would just lead to further demands for concessions.In her reply, Mrs May told him: I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed on at Cabinet on Friday.She said: I am sorry that you have chosen to leave the Government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful Brexit and when we are only eight months from the date set in law when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.If more pro-Leave Cabinet ministers also walk out, the PM will be plunged into the biggest political crisis of her career with the almost certain prospect of a leadership challenge.Most senior Brexiteers including Liam Fox, Chris Grayling and Andrea Leadsom have already pledged loyalty to embattled Mrs May.Michael Gove also backed the PMs Chequers deal - despite admitting hes unhappy with parts of the plan.Boris Johnson has still made no announcement on his future, while Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt have also remained silent since the conclusion of the Chequers summit.Mr Daviss exit will also embolden Brexiteer backbench MPs with concerns about Mrs Mays leadership.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads up a group of 60 Tory Brexiteers, said: This is very important. It raises the most serious questions about the PMs ideas.Peter Bone welcomed Mr Daviss resignation, saying it was a principled and brave decision.The PMs proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable, he said.Andrea Jenkyns said Mr Daviss departure was fantastic news and hailed Mr Baker as another courageous and principled MP.This morning she insisted Mrs May must resign and let someone else take over, saying: The time has come that we need a Brexiteer Prime Minister, somebody who really believes in Brexit.Theresa Mays premiership is over, MPs in our party need to think long and hard over the next few days. I want one who passionately believes in Brexit, who provides true leadership.Andrew Bridgen added: I think there will be other resignations unless the PM announces the Chequers deal is being shelved.But Mr Rees-Mogg urged caution, saying: I dont think a no confidence vote is immediately in the offing.The Conservative party doesnt have a great history of changing its leader - I think its the policy that matters rather than the leader.THERESA May will today argue her plan is the right Brexit for Britain as she faces a leadership crisis.The under-fire PM has been slammed over the soft Brexit proposal agreed by her Cabinet at Chequers on Friday.Eurosceptics have accused her of letting down the 17.4million voters who backed Leave.Last night Brexit Secretary David Davis quit the government in protest at the PMs plans for a soft Brexit.Mr Davis announced his resignation just minutes before midnight with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.May will urge the Conservative Party to stand united and she faces MPs in the Commons this afternoon before a crunch meeting with backbenchers tonight.She must talk them round or face plans to oust her as leader.Eurosceptics claim MPs have started sending no-confidence letters which will spark a leadership content if 48 are received.Backbench Tories have urged pro-Brexit ministers to quit in protest at the new Brexit blueprint.Letters calling for a leadership contest have reportedly been submitted to the backbench 1922 Committee by some Conservatives over the weekend.Mrs May is expected to use a Commons statement today to tell MPs that the strategy agreed on at Chequers is the right Brexit for Britain.She repeated her defence of her plans - insisting her blueprint would undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels.Labour called for the PM to quit herself following Mr Davis resignation.Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, its clear shes more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.Party chairman Ian Lavery Added: This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.“The Prime Minister is in office but not in power. She cannot deliver Brexit and our country is at a complete standstill, while the Tories indulge in their leadership tussling.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.“We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning Government.”Allies of Mr Davis said he decided to quit because he felt the PM’s proposals for a common rulebook with the EU and plans to keep Britain tied to 40 years of EU laws broke the Tory manifesto and Mrs May’s own red lines on leaving.Sarah O’Grady, wife of Mr Daviss chief of staff Stewart Jackson, said Mr Davis wanted to “honour manifesto promises to Britons”.She added: “DD decided he couldn’t sellout his own country.”Mr Daviss department - technically in charge of Brexit negotiations - had been kept in the dark over the PMs final Brexit blueprint that was presented to the Cabinet on Friday.He was understood only to have seen the plans at the same time as other Cabinet ministers on Thursday afternoon.He and Mr Johnson were furious at the PM for showing the proposals to German Chancellor Angela Merkel before them.Eight per cent were left undecided.A separate poll for the Mail on Sunday found 38 per cent of the public viewed Mrs May’s new proposals as a “sell-out”.It found the Tories have lost their lead over Labour. Jeremy Corbyn’s party leapfrogged the Tories and now lead by 40-38 per cent.In another blow for the PM, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he would join Jeremy Corbyns Labour party in voting against Mrs Mays Brexit deal if it mirrored her current proposals.And in a ominous warning to Mrs May, he suggested other Tory Eurosceptics would follow suit, which would threaten to defeat the Governments slender majority.Writing in todays Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg branded Mrs Mays claims that her Brexit deal complies with her red lines misfounded.He wrote: If the proposals are as they currently appear I will vote against them and others may well do the same”.Davis’s fervent Brexiteer deputy at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, following him out of the door is also very significant, as it now resembles the beginning of a leadership coup.In the past eight months Theresa May  has seen her First Minister, Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, Development Secretary and now Brexit Secretary all resign.Normally, Prime Ministers don’t survive that kind of severe and damaging  blow to their political authority.Can this one? We will know by the end of this week.Mr Daviss resignation left Mays premiership seriously under threat - and sparked speculation over the future of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Boris initially branded the soft Brexit plans “a big turd” - but later ditched his opposition.One Tory MP said: “Boris has zero credibility if he stays now.”Up to a dozen backbenchers are reportedly prepared to put in letters to the 1922 Committee calling for a fresh leadership election.If the committees chairman Graham Brady receives 48 such letters, he will be forced to hold a vote of confidence in Mrs May.Mrs May is facing a crunch Commons showdown today with angry Tory MPs. She will say that the deal, agreed unanimously by the Cabinet, is the best for Britain.Mrs May will dismiss claims it breaches her Brexit red lines, telling MPs that the agreement will end freedom of movement, the jurisdiction of European Courts and vast sums of money going to Brussels.And she will rubbish fears that proposals for a common rulebook with the EU for goods will restrict Britain’s ability to strike new trade deals.Scores of MPs said they would vote down the agreement. One senior Tory reckoned a no deal Brexit was now more likely, adding: “The Government has a serious question mark over getting this kind of deal through the Commons.”Environment Secretary Michael Gove said Brexiteers had won a key concession to “step up” the Government’s no deal preparations that would allow Mrs May to “contemplate walking away”.Yesterday Mr Gove admitted the Brexit plan wasn’t “everything you hope for”.But he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: “I’m a realist.”In a statement, Mrs May will say: “It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004183985983.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says theresa may brexit marxism","story":"The Chequers compromise is bad enough — though we understand the necessity of this minority Government buying off the Remainers who dominate Parliament and who would kill Brexit entirely given the chance.But many Tory MPs and Leave voters already consider it a complete betrayal.

The Prime Minister is fighting for her political life after Mr Davis sensationally quit his Cabinet role overseeing Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union. His devastating resignation letter poured scorn on Theresa May\u0027s progressive dilution of her Brexit strategy - saying she had handed too much power to the EU leading to a weak and possibly inescapable negotiating position.  The ex-SAS man warned he had turned into a reluctant conscript. He was swiftly followed out the door by a second Brexit minister, Steve Baker, a source confirmed. Reports suggest a third, Suella Braverman, also quit. Mr Davis\u0027 exit comes just nine months before the UK officially leaves the EU - and with just weeks of negotiating time left before a deal is needed in October.  Downing Street was due to announce Mr Davis\u0027 successor after 9am on Monday, with speculation Theresa May could choose a Remain-backer to support her new, softer position on Brexit. But the PM - due to address MPs and her party on Monday afternoon - is facing the prospect of a Tory leadership battle. Just 48 MPs need to call for her to quit to trigger a contest.   Labour\u0027s Brexit chief refuses to rule out a second referendum  David Davis resigned just 48 hours after a Chequers summit where Cabinet had supposedly agreed on a major shift to soft Brexit. The Prime Minister enraged Brexiteers by proposing a common rulebook between Britain and the EU for goods imported to the UK. There were also reports she would compromise with Brussels on migration. Hours before Mr Davis resigned Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of around 60 Tory Brexiteers, warned he would vote against the defeatist plan. It is understood the Brexit Secretary had taken the weekend to consider his position and future before deciding he could not continue. Sarah Grady, the wife of Mr Davis\u0027 chief of staff Stewart Jackson, declared: DD decided he couldn’t sellout his own country. All eyes are now on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who has not yet publicly spoken in favour of the deal and reportedly described it as a turd during the summit.       Brexiteer Tory MP Peter Bone supported David Davis\u0027 decision to quit. David Davis has done the right thing, a principled and brave decision, he said. The PM\u0027s proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit. With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it\u0027s clear she\u0027s more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.   Ian Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, said: “This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left. “The Prime Minister is in office but not in power. She cannot deliver Brexit and our country is at a complete standstill, while the Tories indulge in their leadership tussling. “We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning Government.”   Tory MPs officially call for vote of confidence in Theresa May - and she expects them to reach crucial threshold  Labour MP Mary Creagh tweeted: David Davis doesn\u0027t even give May the courtesy of resigning during the day. Leadership contest imminent. Johnson \u0026amp Grayling only 2 Leavers who have not backed May publicly this w/end. Tick tock. The PM faces a showdown with 300 Tory MPs on Monday after Boris Johnson said her Brexit plan was “a t**d”. The PM must convince backbenchers to support her at the 1922 Committee – or face being booted out of Downing Street. Brexiteer minister Michael Gove urged fellow Tory Eurosceptics to “get behind the Prime Minister” over the Chequers deal.  Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson backed the plan, despite saying that it was “like polishing a t**d”. But there was open warfare last night with dozens of Tory MPs plotting to oust Mrs May. A letter is circulating which accuses her of “capitulating” over the Brexit talks. And the resignation of Mr Davis will only pile the pressure on the PM on Monday. A briefing by QC Martin Howe said Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan would lead to a “worst-of-all worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state”.  Brexit Chequers summit explained - your guide to the Cabinet showdown that will make or break Theresa May  It takes just 48 MPs’ votes to trigger a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May. Former Labour minister Lord Mandelson said on BBC’s The Sunday Politics: “The Government has, simply, got itself up sh** creek. Without a paddle.” However, Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, who quit a junior government role earlier this year to fight for Brexit and has threatened to vote against Theresa May\u0027s plans for exiting the European Union, tweeted her approval of Mr Davis\u0027 resignation. Fantastic news. Well done David Davis for having the principal and guts to resign. I take my hat off to you. We need to make sure this is now a game changer for \u0026poundBrexit. David Davis\u0027s resignation letter to Theresa May Dear Prime Minister As you know there have been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line, ranging from accepting the Commission\u0027s sequencing of negotiations through to the language on Northern Ireland in the December Joint Report. At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market. I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely. Whether it is the progressive dilution of what I thought was a firm Chequers agreement in February on right to diverge, or the unnecessary delays of the start of the White Paper, or the presentation of a backstop proposal that omitted the strict conditions that I requested and believed that we had agreed, the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one. The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem. In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real. As I said at Cabinet, the common rule book policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense. I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions. Of course this is a complex area of judgement and it is possible that you are right and I am wrong. However, even in that event it seems to me that the national interest requires a Secretary of State in my Department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript. While I have been grateful to you for the opportunity to serve, it is with great regret that I tender my resignation from the Cabinet with immediate effect. Yours ever, David Davis Careless May loses so many ministers since snap election  Prime Minister Theresa May has faced a series of Cabinet members leaving their positions since the snap election last June. The first to leave was defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned his post after being caught up in Westminster sleaze allegations. He said his behaviour had fallen below the high standards required after he admitted putting his hand on the knee of radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer some years ago when he resigned on November 1. One week later, Priti Patel quit as international development secretary over undisclosed and unauthorised meetings in Israel, including with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  In her resignation letter, she echoed the words of Sir Michael, saying her actions fell below the high standards expected. The following month, Ms May\u0027s deputy Damian Green left the Cabinet after a probe found he made inaccurate and misleading statements about pornography on his computer. Justine Greening was sacked in the PM\u0027s reshuffle in January after refusing to move from her education post to the Department for Work and Pensions.

For a few hours the Prime Minister was being praised for holding her Cabinet together after last Friday’s Chequers summit.   Then David Davis resigned .   The Brexit Secretary’s departure raises two questions: one is about the survival of the Prime Minister and the other is about the survival of Brexit.   If his resignation prompts further Cabinet ministers to quit then Mrs May\u0027s position becomes increasingly perilous.   At the moment most of the Brexiteers (Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, Liam Fox, Penny Mordaunt etc) appear signed up to the Prime Minister’s plans.        The one exception is Boris Johnson who will make his decision based entirely on whether it will further his ambitions to be Prime Minister.   Davis, of course, will now be in the position to return to his traditional role as a backbench troublemaker but his spell in government has left him more buckled and less swash .   In his interview on the Today programme this morning Davis made clear he would be campaigning to prevent any further concessions to Brussels.   In many ways the more damaging resignation was that of his junior minister Steve Baker.   Baker is a Brexiteer ideologue who has shown in the past he has the drive and organisational skills to marshall discontented Tory eurosceptics.   All of this will make for an uncomfortable meeting when Mrs May addresses the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers this evening.   Some may be emboldened by Davis’s resignation to push for a leadership challenge .   But to what end?      The Brexiteers could topple Mrs May and try to replace with one of their own but it would change neither the fundamentals – a soft Brexit is the only one on the table – nor the maths – there is no Commons majority for a hard Brexit.   Davis’s resignation letter is incendiary because he is fundamentally right about what he says is Mrs May\u0027s dangerous direction of travel.   Mrs May’s offer will almost inevitably lead to the softest of all Brexits and, as Davis notes, it is looking less and less likely we will leave the customs union and the single market.   As the Brexiteer who was in charge of the negotiations Davis must be furious with himself.   His departure is the equivalent of spelling out in neon lights that the whole sorry project has been a failure.    Those who led the campaign to leave did so on the flimsiest and most speculative of prospectuses.   The only way their vision of Brexit can be achieved is for the UK to abandon decades of accumulated rights and protections which, funnily enough, voters tend to prize quite highly.   Mrs May now has to sell her damaged proposals to recalcitrant MPs and to a bemused Brussels.   It is not certain the PM has ever had an overall strategy for delivering Brexit but her modus operandi appears to be nudge her party one step at a time towards the softest of landings.   So far she has got them to swallow the divorce bill, then the transition period, then the Northern Ireland backstop and now full alignment with EU rules and regulations and the oversight of the European Court of Justice.   And in the process she is revealing that the best path for the UK is to work so closely with the EU and so entwine our economies and laws many will wonder why we don’t go the whole hog and remain full members.    When you are running a government which sees a Cabinet minister resign once every six weeks on average then you may conclude things are not going well.   Though Labour should be concerned that the calamitous state of the Government has not yet translated into a surge of support for Her Majesty\u0027s opposition.   As if Mrs May did not have enough on her plate, a British national now appears to have been murdered on UK soil.   Expect a statement to MPs later on the death of Dawn Sturgess who has died after coming into contact with Russian-manufacture Novichok.       Today’s agenda:   2.30pm – Gavin Williamson takes defence questions in the Commons.   3pm – Officials from the DWP are grilled by the Public Accounts committee on the universal credit.   4pm – James Brokenshire is quizzed by the Housing, Communities and Local government committee.   4pm - David Davis is interviewed on Iain Dale’s LBC show.   6pm (approx) – Theresa May addresses the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs.

His resignation is a major blow to Prime Minister Theresa May and comes after he signed up to the Brexit plan agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers on Friday. He was understood to have serious reservations about both the plan and whether it could be acceptable to Brussels. Here is a look at the career of the long-standing Eurosceptic, 69, who readily admitted to having been branded a charming bastard. Mr Davis was elected for Haltemprice and Howden in 1997, having originally sat for Boothferry since 1987. He read molecular science at Warwick University and studied management at Harvard after shining at grammar school.  The married father-of-three first honed his negotiating skills in the cut-throat world of big business. He enjoyed corporate success in his thirties as a director of Tate and Lyle and President of Zymaize, a loss-making Canadian sweetener manufacturer which he turned into a gold mine. Mr Davis became politically active as a student, cutting an imposing figure even then as chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students. A man with brawn as well as brains, he served as an SAS reservist to help fund himself through college, before entering Parliament in 1987. He had a tough upbringing by a single mother in a Labour working-class household in south London, and still bears the scar on his upper lip from a crowbar attack in Brixton. The two-time unsuccessful Conservative leadership contender gained a fearsome reputation after taking a series of ministerial scalps in a previous role of shadow home secretary. Among those he claims as his victims are former home secretaries David Blunkett and Charles Clarke and ex-home office minister Beverley Hughes.  In June 2008, as shadow home secretary, he shocked Westminster by announcing that he was resigning as an MP to take a stand against the terror detention plan, sparking a by-election that saw him hold his Haltemprice and Howden seat. He was regarded by many as the likely next Tory leader after Michael Howard announced he was to resign, but after a weak campaign - in his second tilt at the leadership - he was soundly beaten in 2005. His rival, David Cameron , had caught the mood with his careful presentation and youthful optimism. In the 2001 leadership contest, Mr Davis cut his losses and quit after twice finishing way down the pack in early ballots of Tory MPs, throwing his support behind Iain Duncan Smith. The contest successfully raised his profile and Mr Duncan Smith appointed him party chairman.

Otterhounds were originally bred, as their name suggests, to hunt otters, but they have been dying out since the practice was banned in 1978. Britain’s Otterhound Club is now appealing for prospective dog owners to choose an Otterhound and protect the breed’s future. They’re rarer than giant pandas or white rhino, with fewer than 1,000 worldwide and 300 in Britain. Will Lazenby is a vet from Coylton in Ayrshire and member of the Otterhound members club.  He says the hunting dogs, which were popular in the Borders for hundreds of years, are the perfect pet. “French bulldogs, pugs and Labradors are usually at the top of the lists of the most popular dogs,” he said. “These are good breeds but people don’t consider these wonderful dogs. “It’s sad as they were considered useful dogs for many, but they’re also excellent pets.” King John of England used the animals to hunt otters in the 12th Century, with Elizabeth I becoming the first Lady Master of Otterhounds. They’re known as the Amiable Hound, or the Clown of Hounds, for their gentle and playful nature. The breed that we recognise today dates back to the 18th Century, and their popularity peaked in the middle of the 19th Century.  “They’re not a rich or a posh person’s dog, though,” said Will. “Otterhounds were seen as a working class dog. They were said to help rid the village ponds of otters feeding on fish. “Dog owners would take Otterhounds to hunt otters, and lots of family and friends would go along too. “It became an event, people would take picnics and make a day of it. “To me it would be very sad if an historic breed like the Otterhound was to die out.” The breed was blamed, though, for a shortage in otter numbers, and laws banning otter hunts were passed in Scotland in 1979 - although the dogs were unlikely to have been to blame. Judith Ashworth is a co-ordinator of the Otterhound Club and has kept them for 35 years.  “They were popular dogs among the hunting community, because otters were considered vermin,” she said. “The decline of otter populations was blamed on Otterhounds and hunting of them was banned — but it turned out to be nitrates and poisons used on the land which was seeping into rivers. “Otterhounds got the blame and they became greatly reduced after that.” Will has urged dog lovers to consider the breed in future, saying they’re the perfect family pet. “You read a lot of rubbish on the internet about Otterhounds being boisterous and needing a lot of exercise, and that they need to live in the country,” Will explained.

The campaigners - reportedly from a group called \u0027Get The L Out!\u0027 - carried banners which said \u0027transactivism erases lesbians\u0027 ahead of the 30,000 strong parade on Saturday. PinkNews filmed the group of \u0027radical feminist campaigners\u0027 forcing their way into the front. Today, Pride in London admitted it had allowed the anti-trans group to lead the march due to safety and hot weather, but has since been forced to apologise. Now a transgender woman has launched a petition - signed by more than 1,200 people - calling on the organisers to stand down. The open letter from Aimee Challenor, 20, from Coventry, said permitting the protesters to lead the march was horrific exclusionary behaviour.  Speaking today, she said: I started the open letter because I wanted to help make a difference so that it wouldn\u0027t happen again, but I knew I was just one voice out a very large community, and so rather than just trying to be one small voice, I put together this open letter so that we could have a big collective voice as our community, and it\u0027s taken off with so many supporters. I was at Pride yesterday, I know transphobia goes against everything that Pride is about, so it\u0027s important to call it out. It’s great to see so much support for this letter condemning transphobia. Pride in London were wrong to allow transphobia to be at the lead of the parade on Saturday, and clearly many members and friends of the LGBTQ+ community agree. I hope now Pride in London will make a full apology, and will allow new people to take the reins, so that we do not see a repeat of the horrific transphobia.  The organisers initially said the parade start had gone as planned before later admitting it had allowed the anti-trans group to lead the march due to hot weather and in the interest of the safety. Aimee launched her petition today and at 4pm it had attracted 1,200 signatures, including Andrew Jones, festival director of Pride in London in 2013. Pride in London has now been forced to apologise and said members reject what this group stands for but said it could not forcibly remove the group as it wasn\u0027t a criminal offence. A spokesperson claimed the group demanded to march behind the rainbow flag, but organisers moved them to an area far in front of the official parade start to separate them. They added: We are distraught by the messages and the hurt that has been caused and we held an urgent meeting with the Community Advisory Board this morning.  The protest group showed a level of bigotry, ignorance and hate that is unacceptable. We reject what this group stands for. They do not share our values, which are about inclusion and respect and support for the most marginalised parts of our community. We are proud of our trans volunteers, proud of the trans groups that are in our parade, proud of our trans speakers at events and proud of the trans people who take part in our campaigns and proud of those who cheered even louder for them yesterday. As volunteers, we are shocked and appalled by this behaviour, not least because some felt threatened by the protesters. London Pride is also going to be reviewing what happened with the Greater London Authority, the politan Police, Westminster City Council and TfL.

Luke Gillman, 25, severely injured a female driver in Trafford when he shot out of a side road and ploughed into her car in September last year. Police said the victim, who is in her 40s, was extremely lucky to survive after she suffered broken ribs, fluid around the heart, whiplash, and severe bruising in the smash in Talbot Road, Stretford. She was in hospital for several days, has also been left with post traumatic stress disorder and has been unable to return to work.  Gillman, who is originally from Leigh, was only on a provisional license and had no insurance at the time of the crash. He was almost twice the legal drink drive limit - with 144 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millllitres of blood - and had traces of cocaine and cannabis in his system. The Citroen Xsara he was driving did not belong to him.  He failed to appear in court after being charged with a string of driving offences and fled to an address in Shropshire, the Manchester Evening News reported .  The victim spotted him going into his mother\u0027s house in Stretford a few months later and alerted the police, who arrested him.  Gillman has now been jailed for a year and banned from driving for 42 months, after he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, drink driving, having no insurance and no full license, and admitting failing to stop in relation to another incident earlier in the evening. The victim had been driving home at 2.15am on September 16 after giving a lift to a reliative. In a statement to police she said: “As I drew level with the junction with Milton Road on my left I saw headlights of a vehicle very close to the side of my car. Before I had time to react the vehicle collided with my passenger side and sent my car spinning across the road. I was trapped upside down. “I was taken to hospital where I was treated for four days and had a precardial effusion which corrected itself, and severe whiplash injuires to my back, neck, and shoulders.” She was in discomfort and pain for ten weeks due to severe bruising from her seatbelt. In an impact statement submitted to court she said: “Since the collision I am now a very nervous driver and even when I am walking I am jumpy. I have had several panic attacks and have been taking anti-depressants.”  She is still having physiotherapy to realign her spine, which was twisted in the crash. “This has had a massive impact on my home life as well as having to find extra money for treatment.”, she added. “I think the hardest thing was the impact this had on my children.  My 10-year-old son has been very upset in school prompting teachers to contact me as he had told the teachers he thought I might die. “My husband had to take time off work to help with the family, I could not even dress myself or bathe myself never mind look after the children as well. “I have been off work since the collision and have been told that I might not be able to return to the same job as result of my injuries, as the job I do is quite physical and I will not be able to do the lifting which is required.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first pictures 14 year old","story":"NewsFirst pictures of 14-year-old schoolgirl Shakira Pellow who died after taking \u0027unknown substance\u0027Three other teenagers are still in hospital after Shakira collapsed and died in Cornwall\u0026nbspShareByPippa Allen-Kinross15:41, 8 JUL 2018Updated16:02, 8 JUL 2018NewsShakira collapsed in a park on Friday (Image: Facebook)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 14-year-old girl who died after taking an \u0027unknown substance\u0027 has been named as Shakira Pellow.

Two 15-year-old girls and a 15-year-old boy were also taken to hospital. One of the girls is in a serious condition.

Already faced with prices soaring by more than \u0026pound1,000 during the school holiday peak, lone parents say the \u0026shyadditional hike can make it impossible to take their children away. And operators such as Jet 2, Tui and First Choice can make the problem worse – as offers of free child places only apply if two paying adults travel with them. Single parent groups say the policy is “unfair” and “out of touch”. We found a one week all-inclusive stay at Bulgaria’s SuneoClub Odessos, \u0026shyflying from Manchester on July 27, costs \u0026pound1,572 for two adults with a free child’s place via First Choice.  But for just one adult and one child, the price is exactly the same. When selecting one adult, the ad for free child places disappears from the site. Airtours offers “child prices” for some hotels – but only when sharing a room with at least two adults paying full price. Thomas Cook Holidays has the same pricing policy. And because the firms do not count children in the room rate, a single parent can be charged an under-occupancy supplement. But it is not just accommodation – other firms also hit single parents with increased fares. A First Choice holiday to the Holiday Village Rhodes for seven nights cost an extra \u0026pound515 per person for a single adult with one child.

Ellie Chessell, 29, has told how she thought she was about to die as she stood screaming in the street, with her body burning “like a bonfire”. Her ex-lover Claudio Gouveia, 35, was jailed last month for 12 years for her attempted murder in 2017. Accomplice Edmundo Fonseca, 44, was jailed for nine years last Friday. He was paid just a few grammes of cocaine to throw acid over Ellie near the hotel she worked in on the Algarve in Portugal. He lured her out of the hotel after arranging a dinner date over Tinder and posing as a businessman.  Ellie had no idea it was a fake date set up by her deranged ex. They had split up two months earlier. He still had her laptop and old phone and had hacked into them to access all her emails and social media accounts to trace her every step. She said: “I saw this man dressed in black and I thought, ‘Bloody hell, he’s odd’. “He was sat down on a bench and his leg was shaking up and down. “The next second I hear ‘desculpe!’ [Portuguese for sorry] and he threw liquid all over me.  “In a split second I realised it was acid and I knew straight away it was him [Gouveia]. “I started screaming and told my friend to help, telling her: \u0027It’s acid. He’s set me up!’ “I felt like I was on fire. The burning was unbearable. “I whipped off my blazer because I could see my dress was melting, it was sticking to me so I threw it to the floor. “And then I just started spitting because I could taste it. I could just see my skin dripping to the floor, dripping on to the pavement.”  She believes Gouveia drove by slowly after the attack – “real blas\u0026eacute” – but did not stop. Ellie was finally helped by a taxi driver with a female British passenger. “The woman wound down her window and was speaking to me trying to calm me down as the driver rang the police and ambulance. “The driver’s window was only open slightly and he said he could feel the heat coming off me on his face. “He said it was like ‘a full-blown bonfire’.” Two police officers who attended were sick nearby after inhaling the fumes and later taken to hospital. The pavement where Ellie was struck was bleached white and even a hedge where he flung the bottle burned. “I’ve never felt pain like it. I thought I was going to die. It was unbearable. I could taste it on my tongue and that was worrying me,” she said.  Ellie ended up in the intensive care burns unit in Lisbon in a glass room to protect her from infection. She had second and third degree burns to her face, chest, both arms, stomach and legs. The next morning she was given a mobile in a sealed plastic bag to phone her mum in the Isle of Wight. “I said ‘Mum, now don’t worry because I’m all right. But that b***ard’s got me!’” Her mum Diana Newman, 60, who flew out to be by Ellie’s side, said: “I wasn’t able to hug her or kiss her or even touch her. It was heartbreaking. “She was covered in bandages like a mummy. We touched hands through the glass and we were both crying.” It was the start of a month’s intensive treatment in hospital for Ellie who was too scared to look under her bandages. “It was yucky, my skin was still being eaten and they put my arms in a bleach solution,” Ellie recalled. Ellie finally broke down when they shaved her head to get a skin graft. “I was in tears and the nurse was in tears, it is what finally broke me. He’d finally taken away my identity.”  Gouveia had been trying to break her for much of their relationship. They met a week after Ellie started as a tour rep on his home island of Madeira in 2015. Within months she was banned from going out alone or contacting her parents in the UK. He started messaging her up to 100 times a day. “I started feeling a bit panicky if I didn’t reply. I felt I was on my knees apologising for everything.” The first time he turned violent was after they visited his relatives and he stormed off after drinking for hours. “When he got home he was spitting and effing and jeffing. It was like he was a monster, smashing things, screaming and spitting, it was grim. “He pinned me up against the bathroom wall around the throat. I had a full-on hand print across my neck.” A month later, Gouveia erupted in violence again, splitting her head open after a night out. Ellie had three stitches in hospital. The police were called but said it was her word against his. She never saw him again and relocated to mainland Portugal. But what Ellie did not know was he had kept her laptop and knew all her passwords and tracked her movements for the next two months.  Ellie, now back home with her mum in the Isle of Wight, told how her terror continued in hospital. “When I opened the message in hospital I felt sick,” said Ellie, who is in counselling for post-traumatic stress. “I thought to myself, ‘He’s not going to stop’. He’s a little terrorist.” Fellow acid attack victim Katie Piper helped her get counselling and laser treatment after the tour rep’s brother, Ryan Chessell got in touch.  Ellie said: “I had been struggling to get help from the NHS. When Katie got involved things started moving.” Now the long journey to get back to normal begins. Ellie said: “I’d love to work as a tour rep but at the moment I lack concentration. I sleep too much, I eat too much...but I want to go back and do something I enjoy.” Evil ex sent naked pic to Ellie\u0027s teen brother Deranged ex Claudio Gouveia sent hundreds of menacing messages and naked photos of Ellie to relatives – including her little brother and his teenage friends. He spent two months spying on Ellie after they’d split by hacking into her social media accounts. Just 24 hours after the acid attack, he sneered: “I am looking forward to our next encounter...” Ellie said about the message: “I felt sick, but we all decided as a family not to respond. “He had dozens of different email addresses and sent hundreds of emails to me. He sent Instagrams. He created fake accounts on Facebook.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how keep your kids cool","story":"AdvertorialHow to keep your kids cool during the heatwave: 9 products which can help protect your little onesIce, ice baby.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Thousands of products – including pasta, biscuits, crisps and cake bars – past their “best before” dates are being snapped up at bargain prices. The new service is operated by Fultons Foods, which hopes it will reduce the amount of perfectly usable produce that gets binned. An astonishing seven million tonnes of food is thrown away in the UK every year, of which three-\u0026shyquarters, or five million tonnes, could still have been safely eaten. Family-run Fultons, which is based in Barnsley, South Yorks, operates 100 stores in the Midlands and North. It sells surplus stock direct from manufacturers at “significantly” lower prices than supermarkets.  The firm’s Karen Gunter said: “An increasing number of UK householders are saving hundreds of pounds by taking advantage of the reality of best before dates. These products are perfectly fine to eat.” “Best before” is a manufacturer’s indication that an item may not be as good quality, but it is not unsafe. Bargains include roast chicken and pasta Mug Shot down from 84p to 29p, Galaxy cake bars down from \u0026pound1 to 79p, bottles of 7 Up lemonade down from \u0026pound1.10 to 59p, and Golden Wonder salt and vinegar crisps from 79p to 50p.  Deliveries, which are made by couriers, are free for groceries costing \u0026pound30 or over. Online retailer Approved Food runs a similar scheme offering 2,000 items near or past “best before” dates. It claims regular customers can save \u0026pound70 on their monthly shop compared to high street prices. The firm’s biggest-selling items include tinned tomatoes and pasta.

Adam Bral, 37, and his bride-to-be, Anna Lewandowska, 40, were forced to buy emergency blow-up beds for guests after The Stage Hotel, in Nottingham, unexpectedly shut up shop. Family had arrived from Poland and London for the big occasion on June 30. Mr Bral was just about to put on his suit and tie he was hit with the devastating news that the hotel he had booked for 17 guests had closed down - and they were left stranded with their suitcases outside, the Nottingham Post reports. The hotel was closed after council chiefs labelled it as a source of anti-social behaviour and crime.  A judge ordered a three-month shutdown on June 29. But this news had not reached the couple - and Mr Bral said the hotel had not warned them of the closure or reimbursed the \u0026pound355 the couple had paid in advance. Shop worker Mr Bral had to come up with a back-up plan four hours before he was about to marry the love of his life. He rang around Nottingham hotels to find a suitable alternative, but to no avail.

He told the Post: On our wedding night we had our friend\u0027s daughter who is six sleeping between us and the bridesmaid was on an air bed in the room with her husband. We had nine people in the living room and also had someone in the bath. My best man had nowhere to stay but did not want to worry me and found a hotel but paid a lot more.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027 christening . The latest royal baby has been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23. We got a quick look at the fifth in line to the throne as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took him home from the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in central London. But his christening will be the first time we\u0027ve seen him in public since. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the christening.... When is Prince Louis\u0027 christening taking place? The date to pop in your diary is Monday, July 9. Kensington Palace has confirmed the service will begin at 4pm and last approximately 40 minutes. Where is Prince Louis being christened? The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will lead service, which will be held at The Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. Louis\u0027 brother George was christened at the Chapel Royal in 2013, while sister Charlotte was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015.  Why is July 9 important to the Queen? Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.  The couple married later that year at Westminster Abbey and became the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. As we all remember from Prince William and Harry\u0027s engagement announcements, it\u0027s a big day for any royal so it\u0027s probably still a special day for the Queen. Her majesty is due to attended to attend Louis\u0027s christening, and it\u0027s expected that Prince Philip will be by her side despite retiring from royal duties last year.  What will Louis wear for the christening? Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn. The Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly made a replica which was debuted on Louise\u0027s younger brother James in 2008. The same gown was worn by Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their christenings.  Who are the godparents likely to be? Royals typically choose loads of godparents, and it is usually made up of other royals and members of the aristocracy. Louis\u0027 dad Prince William had six godparent - including former King of Greece Constantine II and Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin. Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor, who is one of the wealthiest men on the country and another member of the Royal family, Zara Tindall. As for Louis, nothing has been announced yet, but the bookies have a few favourites for his godparents.  Tiggy Pettifer, Prince William and Prince Harry\u0027s former nanny, leads the pack - with Ladbrokes offering odds of 2/1. William\u0027s outgoing private secretary Miguel Head is another favourite, with odds of 5/4.  Why Meghan Markle won\u0027t be godmother The Royals follow a pattern of choosing close friends and even former members of staff rather than family. Meghan, obviously falls in the latter. When will Prince Louis\u0027 official photos be released? Princess Charlotte\u0027s official photos were released the Thursday after her christening, so expect to wait a few days.  How was the christening announced? Just as they did with George and Charlotte, the royal family announced the details of the christening on Twitter. The statement said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to announce that the christening of Prince Louis will take place on Monday 9th July at The Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, London. Prince Louis will be christened by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.   Little Louis was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington on April 23. Just seven hours after he arrived Kate and Wills showed off their new arrival to the world on the hospital steps. Why Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening was in a different place Instead of Chapel Royal, Charlotte was baptised at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in July 2015. The change wasn\u0027t due to her gender, or her ranking, it was thought to be due to the church\u0027s proximity to the family\u0027s new home in Norfolk.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"community chest broughty ymca seeks cash to bring facilities up to 21st century standard","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBroughty Ferry YMCA is hoping to land some of the cash in the Tele’s Community Chest.The group runs a community centre on Brook Street that aims to provide affordable services to everyone in the area.The centre hosts various activities ranging from ballet classes for youngsters to exercise classes for those aged 50-plus.It also has a community garden and men’s shed.There are just three weeks left to collect tokens in the Community Chest giveaway, which is your opportunity to get a share of £10,000 for your non-profit group or club.David Mills, one of the fundraising directors at the YMCA, said: “We are all excited about trying to collect as many tokens as we possibly can.Community Chest 2018“Any funds that we get go straight back into what we do on the front line.“Whatever we get from the competition is a bonus.”The YMCA’s current project involves renovating its Victorian gym and turning it into a state-of-the-art facility, which is where any cash it receives will go.David added: “The showers need brought up to 21st Century standards and then more people would be able to use them.”He said money would go towards equipment, toilet facilities and making sure the building is accessible to people in wheelchairs.He added: “We want to turn it into something we can be proud of.“We want people to come and use a facility that is beautiful on the outside but still in keeping with the heritage and, at the same time, that it is as good as we can make it.”For your chance to grab some cash, all you have to do is work as a team to collect as many of the tokens printed in the Evening  as possible from now until Saturday July 28.Don’t miss out on your chance to enter our Community Chest competition by visiting thetele/promotions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

I was taken aback by some of them myself.“It’s stuff like the first woman doctor and the first woman to be allowed to attend university that people aren’t entirely aware of, which is pretty amazing for Scots.“My inspiration was just to make them look colourful. I didn’t really set out to make them psychadelic but they ended up that way.“The portraits aren’t in any chronological order – it’s not about time. The whole purpose was to make them look cool and timeless while highlighting what they did.“It was really just about giving them a fun background and I’m looking forward to bringing it to the Butterfly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3de12a36b0a-750x564.jpg ","title":"dundee kid kerr waddell could move again as english premier league side keep tabs on him","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKerr Waddell has been farmed out on loan to Morton but there’s a chance the Dundee kid could be on the move again.The 20-year-old, who made 22 appearances for the Dark Blues last term, has been sent to Cappielow until January to gain even more first-team experience.But the Tele understands the move could be shortened because of interest from England. Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership. I think we can all agree on that.”That’s pretty much all he has to say on that last point. He knows the best place to show United’s intent won’t be in interviews but out on the pitch and by getting results.And as Csaba Laszlo’s new-look side gels, he’s confident that will be the case.“We need to do our talking on the pitch,” he added.“Hopefully, all the pieces will come together during the season and the goal is to get to the Premiership.“It is going to take time but the pre-season games and the Betfred Cup games before the league season starts are all preparation for the first game against Dunfermline.“And the Betfred Cup gives us competitive games before the season starts but at the end of the day it is part of our preparation for the start of the league.“It’s a lot better playing games than training all the time but we do want to go on a nice cup run as well.”The early signs up at Glebe Park were encouraging and Aird admits he was pleased with how things went for both himself and his new team-mates.“Obviously, I was delighted to get a run out and get the goal. It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me. Obviously, the manager has a vision of the way he wants the team to play and the direction he wants to go.“It’s an exciting time ahead for the football club and I am glad to be part of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f7e261a320-e1531118160265-670x564.jpg ","title":"get involved tracey and garvie to benefit from dundee triathlon","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee man has organised a charity triathlon to raise money for two local causes.Marc Crighton decided to arrange the swimming, cycling and running event after reading about the plights of Tracey Burke and Garvie Winter in the Tele.The families of Tracey, 33, and seven-year-old Garvie are raising money for cancer treatment abroad.Marc, 31, wanted to do something to help and set about planning the event and obtaining permission from Dundee City Council to hold the triathlon.Now he is appealing for people to take up the challenge, which involves swimming 25 lengths of the 25m pool at Olympia, a 35km cycle and a 10km run, all in Dundee.Marc, from Broughty Ferry, said: “I’m hoping to get 50 people to take part.“The cost will be £25 per person and that will be to cover the health and safety costs. The rest of the money will be split between the two fundraising pages.“I wanted to help but didn’t know what to do, then I thought of the triathlon and started planning it.“The council gave me the go-ahead last week but the event will be on August 1, so it doesn’t give me long to get people involved.“I should probably have allowed more time to get things done but it’s been approved now so I will just get on with it.“Unfortunately I won’t be able to do the event myself as I will have to oversee and manage everything that’s going on.“I’m just remaining positive that a good number of people will be up for it.”Marc previously walked the West Highland Way to raise money for multiple sclerosis, completing the trek in a day.He added: “Because it is local people and not for a national charity, I thought people would be up for doing it.“The money being raised by both families is a huge amount and I noticed there were a lot of people doing smaller events.“My thinking was that I could help by holding a medium-sized event and getting a few people together.”The event will start at Olympia and then continue with the cycle ride, ending at Broughty Ferry Castle.The 10km run will begin and end at the castle.To sign up, visit bodyfuelnutrition/tracey-s-triathlon.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hannah nets dream job at overgate gift shop after chance meeting on way to another interview","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I absolutely love my job so was more than happy when I got asked to be store manager.”Hannah Murdoch, 24, began working at the Little Thistle Gift shop a week after it opened its doors in October 2015.After working in retail since she was at school, Hannah got the job after a chance encounter with the shop’s owner.She said: “I was actually on my way to another job interview when I noticed the shop had opened in the Overgate.“Little gift shops like this are my favourite kind of store so I always have to go in when I see one.“After chatting to one of the owners, Kevin, he told me to hand in a CV since I was looking for a job.“I got a call from him asking me to come in for an interview and they offered me a job there and then.“I absolutely love my job and after working here for a year, I was asked to become store manager, I was so shocked but more than happy to take on the role.”The Little Thistle Gift Shop’s secret is definitely it’s superb range of gifts – and Hannah says she loves being able to talk to customers about the products.“We have a lot of suppliers that we sell in store but it is very important to that the shop stocks local, independent products.“The owners Kevin and Tracey also make some of their own products which we sell.

49, were seizing the opportunity with both hands.The newly-purchased bars include The Boars Rock on Arbroath Road, which John has been running as area manager for nearly 20 years.Other purchases include Halley’s Bar on Strathmartine Road, Caw’s Bar on Panmure Street, The Vault on Reform Street in Monifieth and Sandy’s Bar in Lochee.John, 49, has also snapped up The Barn on Nursery Road, the Bowbridge Bar on Main Street and the Clep Bar on Clepington Road, giving him a wide regional reach.He has kickstarted his residential property portfolio with 11 local properties, seven of which are located above Sandy’s Bar on Liff Road.The purchases represent the next stage in a long career in the licensed trade for John.He became area manager of Redwood Leisure, the previous owner of The Boars Rock, and has long been known by local people for his work in the community, especially with amateur football teams.He then also became a shareholder in Redwood Leisure – which also runs the Invercarse Hotel, Woodlands Hotel and Birkhill Inn – in 2006.However, when the opportunity arose to pursue the solo venture, John said he decided to “go for it”.He said: “All the pubs have regular clientele which was important to me and I would like to keep them the same in the short term but maybe look at developing them into something else in the longer term.“I have always wanted to chase something like this.”Karen added: “I feel excited and I’m looking forward to starting back in the licensed trade.“I’ve been away from it since 2010 when I left to work with the community alarm

with them for 25 years.“I worked alongside John in the licensed trade for 20 years and I feel this is the next step for us.”The couple’s investment in city pubs comes at a time when Dundee’s food and drink trade is enjoying a multi-million-pound boost.Official statistics published by the Scottish Government last month revealed that food and beverage spend across the city grew by £43 million in the

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

festival","story":"\u0026nbspTHE future looks bright for the creative industries in Inverness after another successful XpoNorth event.An estimated 2000 people attended seminars, talks and shared their ideas as part of the annual two-day gathering.Organisers were delighted to see the creativity spill out to the benches and gardens by the River Ness as industry leaders and those looking to progress their career exchanged ideas.The festival was staged in venues across the city but the majority of day sessions were held at Eden Court.Iain Hamilton, head of creative industries at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, said: \"Folk picked the seminars they needed to see and in between enjoyed meetings outside.\"There has been a really great turnout and most of the sessions have been very busy.\"He was also pleased to see Gaelic play such a big role in the festival line-up and applauded the translation services that opened the session up to everyone.\"The Gaelic media sector is unique and provides so many opportunities and it was great for visitors to the area to hear the seminar in Gaelic as well,\" he said.Most of the festival\u0027 emphasis was put on developing the creative industries for the future and this was highlighted with sessions such as Storytelling for 21st Century Audiences \u0026ndash with questions raised about the future of artificial intelligence and how, with using a formula, computers could one day produce stories.There was also a chance for people to enter the creative sector with sessions for those looking to get into television and music and an opportunity to mingle with leaders from across the industry.Mr Hamilton highlighted this as one of HIE\u0027 aims while planning the festival.\"It is giving access to industry leaders, showing what the trends are and what the future might be, it is also a chance for businesses to meet and see how they can work together,\" he said.\"On top of this it brings businesses to Inverness to see what we have on offer.\"The second day of the festival emphasised the importance of the creative sector and tourism industry working together to form events, films and productions that appeal to locals and

Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of

This time he returned fully fit and is clearly ready to stake a claim for a regular starting slot.Wright was impressive in the testimonial for Saints stalwart Chris Millar as he was a constant menace to the defence with his fast creative runs down the flank. The winger also got on the scoresheet as did striker Stevie May, another to produce a strong shift.In previous years, the Reds had a small window of only two to three weeks and endured a congested pre-season before their Euro opener.This summer they have five weeks to prepare for the Battle of Britain with Burnley and have packed in the friendlies.This away match at St Johnstone was the third of six friendlies that will culminate in a clash against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday July 20.Although recently relegated from the English Premier League, the Baggies are essentially a top flight side.The real acid test of just how prepared the Reds are for the Euro campaign will be against Darren Moore’s West Brom.Aberdeen are certainly on an upwards trajectory and look sharper and fitter from that first friendly in Cork.It is all part of a slow-burning build-up to an explosive start to the campaign with Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round and Rangers in the Premiership.Boss McInnes hopes to secure a number of new signings before facing the Clarets but the squad is progressing well.At this stage in pre-season, getting that game sharpness, fitness and understanding within new additions is primary, results are secondary.There were starts for summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson as Dons boss Derek McInnes initially went with a 4-4-2 formation featuring a midfield diamond.There was a two-pronged attack of Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove while Adam Rooney, Aberdeen’s most prolific goal scorer for the last four straight seasons, was on the bench.Aberdeeen recently had a bid rejected by Doncaster for striker John Marquis.McInnes has confirmed the offer was the most the Reds could afford and that they will now look at other centrre-forward targetsin the bid to bolster the attack before the Euro clash with Burnley.St Johnstone grabbed the lead in the fifth minute when former Aberdeen skipper Richard Foster played a cross from the right into the penalty area.The delivery found David WOTHERSPOON who took one touch to control before lashing into the net beyond keeper Joe Lewis from 15 yards.It was the first goal that Aberdeen had conceded in pre-season having defeated Cobh Ramblers 1-0 in Cork and Falkirk 1-0.Aberdeen hit back in the eighth minute with a swift move down the right flank instigated by Gleeson.Midfielder Gleeson threaded a superb through ball between four Saints players to find Ferguson.The 18-year-old picked out Stevie MAY’s diagonal run into the box and the striker dinked a shot beyond keeper Zander Clark.Moments later May was again involved when he flighted in a cross from the right towards Cosgrove who flicked a header just wide of the far post from 15 yards.Aberdeen went ahead in the 27th minute through a solo goal from WRIGHT.The winger collected the ball with his back to goal some 35 yards out, he turned, then drove forward.Bursting into the box, he fired a lethal finish beyond keeper Clark from 15 yards.In the 39th minute, Drey Wright stepped wide of Mikey Devlin to open up space but curled his 22-yard wide.Rooney came on for Cosgrove at half-time and was immediately involved when he met a Wright cross but he headed just wide from the edge of the box.Moments later the impressive Ferguson curled a 25-yard effort inches wide of Clark’s near post.Ferguson plays with a maturity and game intelligence well beyond his young age and looks to be a strong addition to the squad.In the 64th minute, Considine cleared off the line as Greg Hurst got on the end of Liam Craig’s knock-down from close range.St Johnstone levelled in the 73rd minute when HURST curled an effort beyond keeper Joe Lewis into the top far corner.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Devlin, McKenna, Considine, Gleeson, Shinnie, Ferguson, Wright, May, Cosgrove.SUBS: Rooney (for Cosgrove 46), Mackay-Steven (for May 70), McGinn (for Wright 70), Ross (for Gleeson 76), Anderson (for Logan 84), Campbell (for Shinnie 87), Reynolds (for Devlin 90).

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done.

So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them.

And the crew which filmed scenes in Lochgilphead and other parts of Argyll last week thought the town was beautiful.Five weeks of dry weather broke just as they started work, but damp weather made no difference to their view of the town.This does not alter the fact a lick of paint and some weedkiller wouldn\u0026#8217t go wrong, but it serves as a reminder we live in a wonderful part of the world \u0026#8211 whether we can see it or not.Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day is intended as a time to remember the work and sacrifice of our armed forces past and present.It is also an excuse for old cronies to get together and have a dram and a blether.On both counts, it was a success.Well done to everyone involved.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd share the spoils with ardnamurchan","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:30 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The two teams in joint first position in the league shared the spoils in a hard fought match in Strontian.Dunadd went into Sunday\u0026#8217s game with high hopes of securing a win. However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team. The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dust flies in cracking argyll rally","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 12:07 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Dunoon Presents Rally on June 23 saw the Scottish Rally Championship roll into town and 58 top-spec cars and crews take to the stages.Dust flew in dry conditions up in the hills of Cowal as drivers tested their skills among forestry roads in what turned out to be an excellent rally.The route this year was slightly different, with two new stages added to a schedule which saw the cars cover each of the four stages twice through the day with two service stops at Dunoon Stadium along the way.There were a few well known Argyll faces out there, with mixed fortunes on the day.Douglas Watt from Furnace managed to rebuild his Escort after its small excursion on the Scottish Rally in May and he was out again, hoping for better luck and a finish for he and his co-driver, Mark Grierson. The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time. As we get a clearer picture of the condition of the building further restrictions may be necessary to keep rail users and the wider public safe. “We will continue to track the work carried out on the privately owned building with a view to recovering the costs of these works from the owners.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport"},{"url":null,"title":"drink-driving-shepherd-was-stopped-with-child-in-car","story":"A SHEPHERD who assaulted his partner and then drove away in a car with a child while almost double the legal alcohol limit has been banned from the road for 12 months at Jedburgh Sheriff Court.\nForty eight year old George Wylie of Cranshaws, near Duns, had a breath/alcohol limit of 43 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - when police responding to the assault claims breathalysed him.\nThe court was told his 19-year-old partner had threatened to leave him after he came home from working at lambing under the influence of alcohol.\nDuring the bust-up he seized her by the hair and repeatedly kicked her on the body.\nWylie then drove off to a friend\u0027s house a mile away with a five month old child claiming he wanted to take the baby to a place of safety.\nHe was fined \u0026pound270 and disqualified for a year for drink driving.\nIn addition he was ordered to carry out 90 hours unpaid work for the assault and wilfully exposing a child to unnecessary suffering while under the influence of alcohol.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"excitement-building-ahead-of-braw-lads-day","story":"EXCITEMENT is building ahead of Braw Lads\u0027 Day!\nHere\u0027s a quick reminder of what\u0027s happening tomorrow....\nThe Braw Lad will receive the Burgh flag at 8am  \nThe Raid Stane Ceremony will follow at 8.40am\u0026nbsp  \nFording the Tweed at Galafoot is at 9am  \nThe visit to Abbotsford is at 9.15am  \nFording the Tweed at Boleside is at 9.45am  \nThe Gallop over Gala Hill is at 10am\u0026nbsp  \nThe Old Town Cross Ceremony is at 10.30am  \nThe visit to Old Gala House follows at 11am  \nAt 11.30am, the cavalcade will leave Scott Park and go through Scott Street, Gala Park, Kirk Brae, Hall Street, Island Street, High street, Channel Street and Market Street \u0026ndash the dipping of the flag at the war memorial is at midday.  \nAt 7.50pm the march of the Principals and Ex-Principals from Bank Street to the War Memorial will take place.\u0026nbsp  \nAt 8pm the Roses Ceremony will be held.  \nFINAL FLING \u0026ndash at the Volunteer Hall.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

been noticed by the market and is a matter of grave concern.\n\u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos failure to assess the quality of services as well as their cost is lamentable.\nMPs found that the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopreoccupation with cost meant it had to renegotiate more than \u0026pound120 million worth of contracts\u0026nbspsince early 2016 in order \u0026ldquoto ensure public services would continue.\nThe committee said: \u0026ldquoUltimately, this has led to worse public services as companies have been sent a clear signal that cost, rather than quality of services, is the Government\u0026rsquos consistent priority.\n\u0026ldquoContractors told us that the Government was known to prioritise cost over all other factors in procurements, driving prices down to below the cost of the services they were asking firms to provide.\n\u0026ldquoWorse, the Government was unable to provide significant evidence for the basic assertion behind outsourcing: that it provides better services for less public money, or a rationale for why or how it decides to outsource a service.\nMPs were also critical of the way the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) works.\nThe committee said it was \u0026ldquoshocking that the Government had admitted the \u0026ldquoentire (PFI) structure is to keep the debt of the balance sheet.\nSir Bernard Jenkin is chairman of the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (Chris McAndrew/UK Parliament/PA)\nPACAC chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said: \u0026ldquoIt is staggering that the Government has attempted to push risks that it does not understand onto contractors, and has so misunderstood its costs.\n\u0026ldquoIt has accepted bids below what it costs to provide the service, so that the contract has had to be renegotiated.\n\u0026ldquoThe Carillion crisis itself was well-managed, but it could happen again unless lessons are learned about risk and contract management and the strengths and weaknesses of the sector.\n\u0026ldquoPublic trust requires that outsourcing better reflects public service values. The Government must use this moment as an opportunity to learn how to effectively manage its contracts and relationship with the market.\nA Cabinet Office spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe Government is committed to ensuring a healthy and diverse marketplace of companies bidding for government contracts, and we have recently announced a wide package of new measures to further improve how we work with our vendors.\n\u0026ldquoThis includes extending the requirements of the Social Value Act in central government to ensure all major procurements explicitly evaluate social value where appropriate, consulting on improvements to the prompt payment code, as well as measures to make the outsourcing process more robust and the results more transparent.\n\u0026ldquoWe will respond formally to this

campaign","story":"The school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

bag on a school trip to France when they blew it up in a controlled explosion.Christopher, aged 11, a pupil at Castlehill School, was visiting a school in Lourmarin near Marseilles with a group of

first, he said, he was not aware the bag had been lost, but after they arrived at Lourmarin and the bus was emptied, he realised it was missing.He immediately informed the teachers in charge of the group and Francois Bonnard, a French teacher who had visited Campbeltown, phoned the airport to be told that the bag had been found, and after investigation by security, had been blown up.FIFTY YEARS

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

The RNLI thanked the two surfers for raising the alarm and also offering assistance in guiding the crew to the exact location and transferring the man for treatment.  The spokesman added: \u0026ldquoThe recent warm weather is ideal for beach barbecues but we would urge people to take care.  \u0026ldquoEven when a barbecue has cooled the heat of the sand underneath can be considerable, as this man\u0026rsquos injuries demonstrated."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024011.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"university-delight-for-inspirational-paul","story":"  Paul Hannigan was just 12 years old when doctors discovered three tumours on his brain, called a multifocal germinoma, which were affecting his sight.  They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.

All eyes will be on the duchess\u0026rsquos choice of outfit and whether she continues her trend of opting for a neutral palette.  Royal fans will also be looking for signs of broodiness as she joins the Cambridges\u0026rsquo young children at the service.  Meghan\u0026rsquos father Thomas Markle has revealed her longing for a family, saying: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.  Royal babies are baptised in the same intricate cream lace christening gown.  It is a replica of a 19th century one used for most of Queen Victoria\u0026rsquos children which is now too delicate to wear.  At the christening of William\u0026rsquos children, there has usually been a poignant nod to the duke\u0026rsquos late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car crash in 1997.  The princess\u0026rsquos friend Julia Samuel was made George\u0026rsquos godmother, while Diana\u0026rsquos niece Laura Fellowes is one of Charlotte\u0026rsquos.  The Chapel Royal is where Diana\u0026rsquos coffin lay before her funeral to allow her family to pay their last respects."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8042184.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cost-not-quality-is-government-priority-when-outsourcing-services-say-mps","story":"  The collapse of Carillion has exposed fundamental flaws in how the Government awards \u0026pound250 billion worth of contracts for services and projects each year, the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC) found.  Public confidence in the system has been \u0026ldquoseriously damaged by construction giant Carillion going under, MPs said.          The Government handled the final collapse of #Carillon well, but it has exposed fundamental flaws in the Government approach to outsourcing          Our new report on public service outsourcing \"After Carillon\" is out today https://t.co/InMTAEwOLi pic.twitter/vPKpxTrQpu          \u0026mdash PACAC Committee (@CommonsPACAC) July 9, 2018  Services have got worse because contractors know the Government prioritises price over quality, according to the report.  And the Government was unable to present real evidence to back its key claim that outsourcing produces better public services for less money, MPs said.  The study found that the Government\u0026rsquos overriding priority for outsourcing is \u0026ldquospending as little money as possible while forcing contractors to take unacceptable levels of financial risk.  The report states: \u0026ldquoIt is intolerable that the Government is spending \u0026pound250 billion with little evidence that it is currently following its own procedures to secure value for money.  \u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos preoccupation with price has been noticed by the market and is a matter of grave concern.  \u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos failure to assess the quality of services as well as their cost is lamentable.  MPs found that the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopreoccupation with cost meant it had to renegotiate more than \u0026pound120 million worth of contracts\u0026nbspsince early 2016 in order \u0026ldquoto ensure public services would continue.  The committee said: \u0026ldquoUltimately, this has led to worse public services as companies have been sent a clear signal that cost, rather than quality of services, is the Government\u0026rsquos consistent priority.  \u0026ldquoContractors told us that the Government was known to prioritise cost over all other factors in procurements, driving prices down to below the cost of the services they were asking firms to provide.  \u0026ldquoWorse, the Government was unable to provide significant evidence for the basic assertion behind outsourcing: that it provides better services for less public money, or a rationale for why or how it decides to outsource a service.  MPs were also critical of the way the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) works.  The committee said it was \u0026ldquoshocking that the Government had admitted the \u0026ldquoentire (PFI) structure is to keep the debt of the balance sheet.  PACAC chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said: \u0026ldquoIt is staggering that the Government has attempted to push risks that it does not understand onto contractors, and has so misunderstood its costs.  \u0026ldquoIt has accepted bids below what it costs to provide the service, so that the contract has had to be renegotiated.  \u0026ldquoThe Carillion crisis itself was well-managed, but it could happen again unless lessons are learned about risk and contract management and the strengths and weaknesses of the sector.  \u0026ldquoPublic trust requires that outsourcing better reflects public service values. The Government must use this moment as an opportunity to learn how to effectively manage its contracts and relationship with the market.  A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe Government is committed to ensuring a healthy and diverse marketplace of companies bidding for government contracts, and we have recently announced a wide package of new measures to further improve how we work with our vendors.  \u0026ldquoThis includes extending the requirements of the Social Value Act in central government to ensure all major procurements explicitly evaluate social value where appropriate, consulting on improvements to the prompt payment code, as well as measures to make the outsourcing process more robust and the results more transparent.  \u0026ldquoWe will respond formally to this report in due course."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/5149041.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-fans-left-empty-handed-as-touts-snap-up-tickets-for-glasgow-shows","story":"  Fans of the singer-songwriter have been left reeling after all four shows sold out in three minutes.

The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \"common rulebook\".  \"It\u0027s a Trojan Horse deal,\" is how rising SNP star Christopher McEleny described it, predicting that the EU would reject the proposal. \"This is fantasy politics,\" added McEleny, who is also the leader of the party group on Inverclyde Council. \"Every single one of the 27 EU members has to agree it and the plain truth is that they won\u0027t.\"  His comments seemed to be at odds with Sturgeon\u0027s, who described the plan as having \"more realism in it than we\u0027ve seen before from UK government\", although she added \"that\u0027s not saying much\".  Hardline eurosceptic MPs have begun to voice concerns over May\u0026rsquos plans to negotiate a soft Brexit deal. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see \"have the red lines been turned pink\", as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: \"As with eggs. An egg that is very softly boiled isn\u0027t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven\u0027t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.\" A comment underlined by fellow Tory Andrea Jenkyns MP.  The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage described it as a sell out. \u0026ldquoTheresa May has betrayed us all \u0026ndash and Brexiteer ministers are letting her get away with it, he said.  However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas, \"providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market, withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland\u0027s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.\"  She also hit out at the SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had \"used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart\".  Downing Street is now engaged in desperate efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics after May\u0027s Brexit compromise plan which keeping the UK closely tied to Brussels was agreed by her Cabinet.  The Prime Minister\u0027s inner circle is now desperately trying to secure support from the party\u0027s eurosceptics for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods.  Cabinet Brexiteers may have already been persuaded to support the plans after a marathon session of talks at Chequers, but backbench eurosceptics continue to express grave doubts.  The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK\u0027s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize. The cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the proposal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal.  Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week following.  The SNP\u0027s McEleny predicted that May\u0027s team would blame a failure of negotiations on the EU and that the final outcome would be a hard Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"fiona-hyslop-our-links-with-japan-and-south-korea-have-gone-from-strength-to-strength","story":"  As Brexit uncertainty continues to impact on business confidence \u0026ndash and as we face the threat of losing membership of the Single Market and Custom Union \u0026ndash it is increasingly important that we continue to engage with international partners and build trade and business links.  As highlighted by a recent EY Attractiveness Survey, Scotland is one of the most alluring locations for foreign direct investment outside of London. Scottish Government visits such as this are therefore critical to promote our unique assets to international audiences.  This is why during this visit I met with key business representatives across a range of sectors including renewables, subsea engineering and life sciences \u0026ndash from Mitsubishi Electric to the Nippon Foundation \u0026ndash to acknowledge the significant contribution these businesses make to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and to reiterate the message that Scotland is an excellent partner to do business with.  The ties between Scotland and Japan date back 150 years to a time when Scots engineers helped the Pacific nation kick-start its own industrial revolution. The links between our countries have since gone from strength to strength \u0026ndash so that, to date, 90 Japanese-owned businesses at 135 Scottish sites employ over 6,000 staff, generating a Scottish turnover of more than \u0026pound1.8 billion.  In 2016, exports to Japan increased by more than 10 per cent to \u0026pound460m, making Japan the 19th top destination for Scottish exports. With foreign direct investment into Scotland from Japan accounting for almost six per cent of all inward investment over the past decade, I believe there is scope for even closer collaboration \u0026ndash to seize shared opportunities and meet common challenges as both our countries look to address the growing needs of the global market.  Following the launch of our Scotland is Now campaign, this visit was an opportunity to further promote Scotland as a top destination to visit, live, work, invest and study. I held tourism events in both Tokyo and Seoul. I also signed a joint declaration of co-operation between Scotland and Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan and host to two of Scotland\u0026rsquos Rugby World Cup games in 2019.  Building on the constructive meeting I held with Yokohama\u0027s mayor during my last visit, this declaration is an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and expertise, while strengthening existing ties in the areas of education, sports, culture and marine industries as Japan builds to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics in 2020.  In addition, I met with local representatives and culture stakeholders to share best practices and discuss how culture in Scotland plays a vital role in shaping our cultural identity, strengthening business links and promoting our country internationally.  While in Tokyo I met with representatives from Japan\u0026rsquos Ricca Ricca Festival, the annual international festival of performing arts for young people held in Okinawa. This year, the festival will focus on Scotland as a result of a joint funding initiative between Ricca Ricca, Creative Scotland, Scottish Government and British Council Scotland. As we celebrate Scotland\u0026rsquos Year of Young People 2018, this represents a great opportunity for Scotland\u0026rsquos world leading children\u0026rsquos theatre to showcase their talent to international audiences beyond our borders.  I also met with Japanese city leaders in Tokyo to discuss how Scotland\u0026rsquos arts community can help Japan shape its cultural programme for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Japanese prefectures are now looking to deliver a world-class programme of cultural activity as part of the Olympics and are looking to Scotland for inspiration. It was a pleasure to discuss Scotland\u0026rsquos use of culture as a promotional tool in domestic and international markets while we get ready to welcome our Japanese partners to Scotland this August during Edinburgh\u0026rsquos peak festival season.  I was delighted to witness the signing of an important agreement between Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, a major Japanese industrial corporation, and the Underwater Centre near Fort William. It will see the world\u0026rsquos first test of an autonomous underwater vehicle take place in Scotland. Kawasaki will carry out a verification test of a prototype AUV equipped with a robot arm for subsea pipeline inspection.  This visit also represented an opportunity to promote our world-leading universities and to announce that the Scottish Government flagship Saltire Scholarship programme will open to Japanese postgraduates. Currently available to students from Canada, China, Pakistan and the US, the fund offers 50 scholarships worth \u0026pound8,000 per year, co-funded by the Scottish Government and partner universities.  In South Korea, I met with key tourism leaders and travel media, an ideal opportunity to further promote business and travel contacts between our two countries. I also met companies that are keen to build on their trade and investment in Scotland.  In 2017, Scotland exported 744 million of goods to South Korea, a 165 per cent increase on the previous year. Korean company Doosan Babcock is a key investor in Scotland, employing approximately 1,200 people across eight different sites,with the main facility in Renfrew.  At government level, I focussed on developing links on rural development and cultural issues.  Scotland has strengths and qualities that make it a unique location for international cooperation and investment. My message to our friends in Japan and the Republic of Korea is that, whatever your reason for coming to Scotland, you will be offered the warmest of welcomes here and will find a bold and positive country shaping a progressive, pioneering and inclusive future."},{"url":null,"title":"gove-says-chequers-agreement-offers-proper-brexit-and-urges-colleagues-to-back-pm","story":"  The Environment Secretary, who was a leading light in the Leave campaign, accepted that Friday\u0026rsquos agreement was not everything the Brexiteers had wanted but stressed it was a \u0026ldquoperfect balance between sharing regulations on 20 per cent of the UK economy - a \u0026ldquocommon market of goods - with the EU but being outside the bloc\u0026rsquos remit on 80 per cent of it ie services.  Asked if the Chequers deal was everything he had personally hoped for, the Scot told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show: \"No. But then I\u0027m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn\u0027t, you shouldn\u0027t, make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the Cabinet.  \u0026ldquoAll those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the Prime Minister in order to negotiate that deal.\"  Mr Gove rebuffed the suggestion by his Cabinet colleague and fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson that selling Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise would be like \u0026ldquopolishing a t***.  He denied the Chequers deal offered \u0026ldquofake sovereignty or that it would plunge Britain into a \u0026ldquoBrexit black hole and stressed that from now on \u0026ldquocollective responsibility reigns.  The Secretary of State also warned Brussels not to be inflexible in its response, saying if it continued to be so, then Britain would \u0026ldquowalk out of the talks.  The PM, who tomorrow is due to make a Commons statement on her compromise deal and will later address Tory MPs at a potentially fractious meeting of the party\u0026rsquos 1922 backbench committee, is said to be facing a potential leadership challenge with right-wing critics accusing her of \u0026ldquocomplete capitulation to Brussels.  Some 48 signatures from Conservative MPs are needed to spark an automatic leadership contest.  Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen expressed his unhappiness with Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise by declaring he would not back it \"if the EU were paying us\".  He told BBC Radio 5 Live\u0027s Pienaar\u0027s Politics: \"I\u0027m very, very disappointed with the offer that we\u0027ve seen coming out of Chequers I\u0027m disappointed that so-called Brexiteers in the Cabinet didn\u0027t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer.\"  Yet, despite the offer \"crossing many of the supposed red lines\" outlined by the PM, the Leicestershire MP, when asked about a demand for a confidence vote in his leader, said: \"We\u0027re not there yet.\"  Earlier, he wrote Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-Brexit European Research Group, was now the only credible challenger to Mrs May after the failure by Cabinet ministers to oppose the Chequers plan.  Veteran Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash was also keen not to rush into challenging Mrs May\u0026rsquos leadership and said he would wait for the detail in the White Paper, which is due to be published later this week.  The Staffordshire MP told Sky News: \"There are a lot of questions in here, there is a lot of unhappiness, there is a great deal of concern that we are saying that we leave it\u0027s not \u0027to be or not to be,\u0027 it\u0027s \u0027to leave or not to leave\u0027.  \"The question is how do you leave and is this going to be a proper Brexit? There will be a massive discussion about all this.\"  Sir Bill said he had not written a letter calling for a leadership contest but \"if people were to decide to put in those letters you only need 48 and as a matter of fact nobody can stop them, once the decision has been taken by those people the chairman of the 1922 Committee has to implement the process.\"  Meanwhile, the Labour leadership branded the Chequers deal \"unworkable\" and a \"fudge\" and challenged the PM to put it to a Commons vote.  Sir Keir Starmer described Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise as a \"bureaucratic nightmare\".  He told the Marr Show: \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s got fudge written all over it.  \"If you look at the facilitated customs arrangement, the sort of heart of this, it\u0027s a rebadging of the partnership and it\u0027s based on the idea that at the border you can distinguish between goods that are going to stay in the UK and those going to the EU.  \"It\u0027s unworkable, it\u0027s a bureaucratic nightmare, so this a fudge,\" declared the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  The Labour frontbencher called for MPs to be given the chance to vote between Labour and the Government\u0027s customs plans.  \"We\u0027ve now got two propositions, we\u0027ve got the Labour proposition, which has the majority support in Parliament, and the Prime Minister\u0027s new proposition, let\u0027s put it to a vote. I challenge the Prime Minister: put it to a vote and see where the majority is in Parliament on a customs union,\" added Sir Keir.  His Labour colleague, Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, said he believed the transition period would have to be extended under the Chequers agreement.  Asked if more time would be needed to negotiate a deal with the EU, he replied: \"It\u0026rsquos definitely more likely the transitional period is going to have to be extended because the Government itself now admits that now with this latest version, this facilitated customs arrangement it isn\u0027t going to be ready by the end of the current proposed transition period which is December 2020.\"  He added that if the plans did not work out, then the Government should \"bite the bullet and say remaining in the customs union is much the simplest and easiest way of doing this\".  Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, said Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise was \"sensible\" and called on her colleagues to stop arguing.  \u0026ldquoMy sense is that we now really need to stick together as a party, get behind the Prime Minister and try and make sure that we support her as she goes through what are going to be monumentally difficult negotiations with the EU.\"  She added: \"The time for arguments within that Chequers team, within that Cabinet team, has now got to stop.\"  Elsewhere, Gerard Batten, the Ukip leader, said the Chequers deal was a \u0026ldquobetrayal of the referendum vote.  \"May has done everything she possibly can in the past two years to delay Brexit, to impede Brexit, and all in the intended outcome of reversing the referendum decision.  \"The Chequers agreement is the opposite of what Mrs May promised us two years ago, when she said the UK wouldn\u0027t be half-in and half-out of the EU.  \"With this agreement, we are more in than we are out and means the UK will have a similar status to those countries applying to join the EU.  \"The implications of that is obvious. It would seem to me that Mrs May hopes that by getting rid of the Ukip MEPs next March the party will disappear from the political scene.\"  But he added: \"This agreement betrays the referendum result and shows exactly why Ukip needs to become stronger than ever.\""},{"url":null,"title":"watch-hopes-soar-for-boys-trapped-in-thai-cave-as-ambulance-leaves-affected-area","story":"  The Thai official leading the rescue operation said it has gone \u0026ldquobetter than expected and that the\u0026nbsphealthiest boys have been taken out first.  Four were brought to the surface on Sunday, more than two weeks after a football team and their coach were trapped underground.  The next phase of the operation will start in 10 to 20 hours, according to authorities.  Chief of operations governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said 13 foreign and five Thai divers are taking part in the operation.  The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) confirmed that seven divers from the UK with \u0026ldquoexpertise in cave diving are assisting.  Two elite British divers, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, were the first rescuers to reach the group on Monday night and are believed to be part of the team.  A BCRC spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe UK divers are part of the core team, so they will be actively involved and that will include escorting each child out through the flooded passage.  \u0026ldquoThe operation is being supervised by the Thai authorities.  \u0026ldquoThey have had to make a quick decision because they are really concerned about the water level rising.  Two divers will accompany each boy as they are gradually extracted.

A doctor and paramedics are standing by to provide medical attention whenever the rescue team emerges.  Rescuers pumped millions of litres of water out of the cave network to try to extract the group through nearly a mile of tunnels.  Thai officials are not only racing against worsening weather, but also lowered oxygen levels in the underground complex in the north of the country.  Former Thai navy Seal Saman Kunan passed out making the dive on Friday and died.  The boys, aged 11-16, and their coach, 25, were trapped inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai after a football game on June 23.  Monsoon flooding cut off their escape and they have been on a rocky shelf inside a cave chamber since.

Although it is now less yomping youths and more budget family hotel, half of the 72 beds are still dedicated to shared dormitories for those who like the simple charm of communal living for which the hostels are famed.  As it nears its 9th decade, the organisation that runs the 34 Scottish hostels undertaken a name-change - from the Scottish Youth Hostels Association to Hostelling Scotland - which was executed this year.  Research showed that while older people used and still use or are rediscovering hostelling, younger people understood the concept less.  Glen Nevis is part of the resulting overhaul that includes developing gems like its hostel on the edge of Loch Ossian, renovation of Lochranza on Arran and could also include expansion with new properties including in St Andrews.  Wardens are also consigned to history, with managers there in their place and new apprenticeships are being developed to help bring in young staff.    Margo Paterson, Hostelling Scotland chief executive, said the evolution will continue as the organisation settles into its new identity.  She said: \"This major redevelopment project truly reflects our commitment to the modernisation of our accommodation network.  \"It also highlights our mission to make more of Scotland more accessible to more people than anyone else, and especially young people, providing great value, affordable, flexible and welcoming accommodation in the best locations across Scotland.\"  She said:\u0026nbsp\"We pride ourselves in excellent customer service, listening to our members and guests, understanding their needs and developing our network to offer the best possible hostelling experience.  \"The new Glen Nevis Youth Hostel, one of our flagship hostels, highlights this perfectly. We want guests to discover the real Scotland with us.\"  She said removing the word youth from their title did not reflect a move away from core customers and schemes to help groups of young people embark on rural adventures are also under way.  The \u0026pound6 membership and guest overnight income supports its charitable youth programmes and the maintenance of the hostelling network.  Following the strategic review of the organisation early in 2018, the 88-year-old hostelling association said: \"The new identity follows on from extensive marketing research and reflects the organisation\u0026rsquos commitment to understanding the needs of its members, guests and employees as the modern face of Scottish Hostelling.  \"The name also more clearly indicates its representation of Hostelling International within Scotland.\"  The 34 Hostelling Scotland hostels is about half of the number hostels from a decade ago, but it attracts 380,000 guests every year, with a turnover of \u0026pound9m and an estimated contribution to the Scottish visitor economy of \u0026pound25m.  As well as the network of hostels across Scotland, members get dual membership with Hostelling International, providing access to more than 4,000 youth hostels in over 90 countries worldwide."},{"url":null,"title":"david-davis-resignation-who-why-and-what-happens-next","story":"  The long-serving Conservative MP was among the new intake when Tony Blair\u0026rsquos new Labour swept to power in 1997. In the two decades since, the former SAS reservist has become an established figure within the party, challenging David Cameron to a 2005 leadership contest which the younger man went on to win. He would become a key ally in Theresa May\u0026rsquos embattled Cabinet.  Why was he important to Theresa May?  The no-nonsense politician revelled in the description of being Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoBrexit bulldog, charged with leading negotiations with his EU counterpart over the country\u0026rsquos withdrawal from the bloc. He has been noted by former colleagues for his \u0026ldquotough, resilient approach. His role as Brexit Secretary was crucial to ensuring Britain leaves the EU next year with what Mrs May described as the \u0026ldquobest possible deal.  So what does this mean for the PM?  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine a more potentially crippling blow to her premiership. Following a long weekend which started with extended talks over the country\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU at Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers country pad, an agreed strategy met the backing of her Cabinet. It seemed like the most damaging line to emerge from the summit was Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos description of the plans as a \u0026ldquoturd. But as the weekend grew older, dissenting voices from the Tory backbenches grew louder. In short, the PM is facing the prospect of steering the country towards the biggest political junction in a generation without her captain at the helm.  Was Davis\u0026rsquos departure telegraphed?  The Brexit Secretary was understood to have serious reservations about both the plan and whether it could be acceptable to Brussels following the Chequers summit, but was absent from the television studios in the aftermath of the talks. He has been close to the exit door on a number of occasions in recent months. Last year reports emerged that Davis said he intended to \u0026ldquoretire in 2019 and leave the transitional period of Britain\u0026rsquos exit from the European Union to Boris Johnson, something later dismissed as a \u0026ldquolighthearted remark.  Is Davis the first of many?  There was a feeling that any departure \u0026ndash be it immediately after the summit or once the EU made it clear Britain\u0026rsquos terms were unacceptable \u0026ndash could trigger a series of resignations from the front benches, particularly from hardliners. Mrs May must be expecting others to go with Davis, and will be particularly keen to know what the likes of Mr Johnson and fellow Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom intend to do now.  Could it get any worse for the PM?  Yes. An avalanche of departures would surely trigger a leadership contest in the Tory party. Simply, if the Prime Minister cannot unite her Cabinet and convince them over the Brexit negotiations, she has no chance of getting the EU to agree to the terms."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-should-scots-support-england-no-it-only-makes-victory-sweeter-for-us","story":"  I sat my final exam at college in the morning before heading to a pub where happy hour pints were just \u0026pound1.  There were Saltires hanging above the bar, and a raucous crowd that erupted in cheers when John Collins scored a penalty to level the game against the eventual champions.  The pub was in York the audience was largely English.  Growing up in northern England, it never occurred to me not to support Scotland, or any of the home nations. Why wouldn\u0026rsquot I?  Unless we were playing each other, of course.  I am a passionate England fan it was Italia \u0026rsquo90 that hooked me. I couldn\u0026rsquot watch the Egypt game live so I recorded it on VHS and watched it in full when I got home. I watched the Cameroon quarter final \u0026ndash the last time England won at that level before Saturday - on a black-and-white TV in my aunt\u0026rsquos farmhouse, and was allowed to stay up late to watch the West Germany semi-final on a tiny TV in my bedroom, before crying myself to sleep.  The first poster on my bedroom wall was of Gary Lineker I\u0026rsquoll never forget watching Gazza play against Sweden at Elland Road in the Umbro tournament in 1995 I had to be picked up off the floor outside a Corfu bar in 1998 because I was inconsolable when Argentina knocked us out on penalties in the knockout stages.  Then, perhaps unwisely for such a diehard England fan, I moved to Scotland.  England\u0026rsquos next tournament game was in Euro 2000, against Portugal. I watched it in a bar in Edinburgh and it was my first real experience of the Anyone But England (ABE) phenomenon.  When Portugal came back from 2-0 down to win the game, the cheers and cries of \"sunny Portugal, we\u0026rsquoll support you ever more\" were deafening.  For someone who grew up in England, yet always supported Scotland, it stunned me. I simply wasn\u0026rsquot prepared for the animosity. I was bitter and upset.  But that was then this is now. Nearly two decades on, I get it, and I revel in it. It\u0026rsquos a footballing rivalry and it\u0026rsquos a healthy one. I even felt comfortable enough to watch last year\u0026rsquos Scotland v England game in the home end at Hampden.  I watched England\u0026rsquos World Cup game against Panama in an Edinburgh bar. There were fans in England tops bellowing out \"It\u0026rsquos Coming Home\", while others cheered Panama\u0026rsquos consolation goal as if it had been scored by Leigh Griffiths himself. It was a cracking atmosphere, with no hint of tension.  Traditionally, of course, it\u0026rsquos the ABE crowd which has more fun. Like the time Frank Lampard\u0026rsquos goal against Germany was disallowed and we went on to lose 4-1. Or the time Portugal knocked us out on penalties. Correction: times, plural.  The pain of defeat has hurt over the years, but boy is this tournament is making up for it.  Every two years the same debate takes place: should Scots support the Auld Enemy?  There are those who insist Scots should back England, arguing that to do otherwise is embarrassing. I\u0026rsquom not one of them \u0026ndash it makes victory even sweeter for us.  There are those \u0026ndash mainly politicians \u0026ndash who pick another team for spurious reasons. The correct choice for politicians whose nation is not playing is that they\u0026rsquore not supporting anyone, precisely because their nation is not playing.  And there are those who watch every England game in the hope of a humiliating defeat for the Three Lions.  This contingent is smaller than in previous years, and some put that down to the humility of Gareth Southgate and his young squad. Yet perhaps a bigger reason is we now have a generation of Scotland fans who have never known qualification for a major tournament, making rooting for England\u0026rsquos opponents all the more futile.  In the binary world of post-indyref Scotland, where everyone is forced to be a Unionist or a Nationalist, it is inevitable that politics poisons the football debate.  In a newspaper column last week, the pro-independence columnist Lesley Riddoch wrote: \u0026ldquoAs Scotland finds its new place in the North Atlantic and the league of small, energy-rich European states, our age-old enmity with England will become utterly irrelevant.  Completely failing to understand that the enmity is to do with a footballing rivalry, not the constitution, does she actually think independence involves sawing along the border and allowing Scotland to float off in the direction of Iceland?  She added: \u0026ldquoOne day, football and the constitutional question in Scotland will be equally disconnected.  It always has been, Lesley, and it\u0026rsquos only fanatical nationalists who make it otherwise.  Among real fans, there is no link between constitutional preference and support or otherwise for England. Some of the most vociferous ABE backers I know are diehard Tories.  It is perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to be part of the UK and to want England to be crushed on the football pitch. It\u0026rsquos also perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to leave the UK and to want England to win on the football pitch.  Or any combination of the above: there are no strict rules.  You don\u0026rsquot get much more passionate about independence than the SNP\u0026rsquos former Westminster leader Angus Robertson, who tweeted this week: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely delighted for England, all English fans, friends and relations. Congratulations.  Oh how the SNP misses him in the Commons.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine Angus would have resorted to such petty antics as his successor Ian Blackford and colleagues did last week, when they repeatedly dawdled through the voting lobby and ensured English MPs and Commons staff missed the Colombia game.  A healthy rivalry should not involve sabotage. Just imagine if Scotland had qualified for the tournament and English MPs pulled the same stunt during a crunch match.  So it\u0026rsquos the semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. Nearly three decades since the last time England reached this stage. Just like Gazza in Turin, it\u0026rsquoll probably end in tears.  But maybe, just maybe, Southgate\u0026rsquos men really are going to bring football home. After all those penalty defeats, all the failures of the \"golden generation\", all the crushed dreams, what absolute joy that will bring me \u0026ndash and what pain it will bring for so many Scotland fans.  I absolutely can\u0026rsquot wait."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8041789.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tribute-to-greatest-test-pilot-can-help-youngsters-dreams-take-off","story":"  Now Captain Eric \u0026ldquoWinkle Brown is to be honoured with the creation of a flying scholarship in his name for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Two years after he died at the age of 97, the most decorated pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) has been permanently honoured with a statue at Edinburgh Airport, his old base.  And there are additional plans for a more far-reaching memorial to the Leith-born aviator, with the scholarship being considered by a group of former pilots connected to his old university.    Eric Brown in a Wildcat, one of the 487 different types of aircraft he flew \u0026ndash a world record  The ex-pilots from the Edinburgh University Air Squadron Association (EUASA) got together to raise the funds for the life-sized bronze statue of Captain Brown, by Scottish sculptor David Annand.  Now Dr Hamish Macleod, chairman of EUASA, said the squadron also wants to put the scholarship in place to allow young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access light aircraft flying.  He said: \u0026ldquoWinkle was not only a man who loved to fly, but he also inspired a generation of pilots with his modest good humour and outstanding courage. The statue of him outside Edinburgh Airport will give the many thousands of passengers the opportunity to reflect on this Scottish hero who can inspire us all.  \u0026ldquoWinkle\u0026rsquos legacy can also bring a life-changing experience to today\u0026rsquos youngsters assisting them to learn to fly, or simply experiencing the thrill of flying in small aircraft.  The squadron raised \u0026pound50,000 for the statue and are bidding to raise a further \u0026pound50,000 to set up scholarships, with the estimated cost to achieve solo flying standard being \u0026pound3,000.  Captain Brown\u0026rsquos own flying experience started with a bumpy but exhilarating ride in his father\u0026rsquos First World War Royal Flying Corps bi-plane, which sowed the seed of ambition in an eager eight-year-old.  He learned to fly himself at the earliest opportunity he could after leaving Fettes College as a student at Edinburgh University, which was an RAF recruitment route.    Prince Andrew unveiled statue of Captain Eric Brown  During his early adventures, he saw Hitler\u0026rsquos oratory at the 1936 Berlin Olympics with his father and at one stage in his life managed to sing with the Glenn Miller band.  He became a British Royal Navy officer after training at RAF Turnhouse, now Edinburgh Airport, in the late 1930s and came to be affectionately called Winkle, short for periwinkle, by his friends because of his physical stature.  His most amazing achievements were in his role as a Royal Navy test pilot, during which he pioneered the perfecting of breakneck aircraft carrier deck landings.  Captain Brown holds the world record for flying the greatest number of different types of aircraft, a total of 487, which is a feat unlikely to be rivalled. The highly-decorated pilot also holds the world record for landings on aircraft carriers, at 2,407, and for take-offs on aircraft carriers, at 2,721.  Also in action, he used his language skills to interview Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering, and was among those who liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.  He flew home a rocket-powered enemy aircraft, a Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a Komet, back to Britain from Germany after the aircraft was captured in 1945.    Sir John Elvidge, chairman of Edinburgh Airport, said: \u0026ldquoCaptain Eric \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo Brown is a someone who is synonymous with RAF Turnhouse and, in turn, a key figure in the history of what is now Edinburgh Airport.  \u0026ldquoHis achievements speak for themselves and the fact his remarkable career is still held in such high regard after all these years is testament to the man himself.  \u0026ldquoWe are proud of the connection between Edinburgh Airport and the RAF and we want people to share that by learning about this truly inspiring man who served his country with great honour, and this statue is a small token of thanks to him and his legacy.  The statue to honour Leith-born Captain Brown was unveiled at Edinburgh Airport by the Duke of York, who himself served as a pilot in the Royal Navy for almost 20 years and now holds the rank of Vice Admiral.  The pilot has also received high praise from British astronaut Tim Peake who when he died tweeted a tribute from the International Space Station saying Capt Brown was \u0026ldquoto my mind the greatest test pilot who has ever lived.  First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said when Captain Brown died that he was one of the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos greats.  Paying tribute after his death, he said: \u0026ldquoThe Fleet Air Arm may have lost one of its finest and best-known pilots, but British aviation has lost something even greater \u0026ndash the most accomplished test pilot of his generation and perhaps of all time, and a huge advocate of military aviation.  His family said in a statement released after his death: \u0026ldquoEric was the most decorated pilot of the Fleet Air Arm, in which service he was universally known as \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo on account of his diminutive stature.  \u0026ldquoHe also held three absolute Guinness World Records, including for the number of aircraft carrier deck landings and types of aeroplane flown."},{"url":null,"title":"boost-for-electric-vehicle-charge-points-to-be-announced","story":"  Chris Grayling will unveil proposals that could lead to the installation of hundreds of thousands more charge points for electric vehicles to encourage more people to adopt ultra low-emission vehicles.  The initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.  The strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.  The Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.  Alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.  Launching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.  \u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.  \u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.  A study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.  The mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.  Separate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.  The motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth buying.  \u0026ldquoThese Road to Vision Zero proposals are a step in the right direction but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-to-propose-practical-alternatives-over-irish-border","story":"  The UK in a Changing Europe released a detailed assessment of what the British Government must address in its Brexit white paper after UK Cabinet ministers agreed to a plan on Friday.  Professor David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen\u0026rsquos University Belfast, contributed to the wide-ranging report in which he addressed the most pressing issues involving Brexit and the Republic of Ireland.  The report argues that Downing Street must provide a credible plan for a customs relationship, setting out a proposal that is acceptable to the EU and is feasible both practically and financially.  It said that while it acknowledges the significant political constraints within which Prime Minister Theresa May is having to act, the UK Government cannot \u0026ldquocherry-pick parts of the single market.  The report states that the UK will have to shift its red lines or accept an inferior deal.  The 36-page report, which was written by leading academics, also states that Mrs May\u0026rsquos Government must allow for continued North-South co-operation in the island of Ireland.  It also states that it should \u0026ldquopropose what kind of governance and dispute settlement arrangement it wants and decide on the institutions it wants to govern future relations with the EU as well as setting out details on the UK\u0026rsquos own governance arrangements.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe white paper must address the often conflicting interests within and between sectors addressing the high levels of uncertainty afflicting a number of economic sectors including fisheries and agriculture.  \u0026ldquoIt must choose its preferred model for managing the financial sector and recognise a trade-off between regulatory autonomy and access to EU markets in financial services and indicate what the choice will be."},{"url":null,"title":"island-vigil-for-alesha-macphail","story":"  Local people gathered to light candles for the six-year-old in Rothesay\u0026rsquos Guildford Square on Sunday evening.

The North\u0026rsquos statement, coming so soon after Mr Pompeo\u0026rsquos trip, was sure to fuel growing scepticism in the US over how serious Mr Kim is about giving up his nuclear arsenal.  \u0026ldquoIf those requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster, Mr Pompeo said, noting that numerous UN Security Council resolutions have demanded that the North rid itself of nuclear weapons and end its ballistic missile program.  \u0026ldquoPeople are going to make stray comments after meetings, Mr Pompeo said.  \u0026ldquoIf I paid attention to the press, I\u0026rsquod go nuts.  Speaking after meeting with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Tokyo, Mr Pompeo said his two days of talks in Pyongyang had been productive and conducted in good faith.

Two days of talks with senior North Korean officials had \u0026ldquomade progress, he said, and included a \u0026ldquodetailed and substantive discussion about the next steps.  Those include the formation of working group to determine exactly how North Korea\u0026rsquos denuclearisation will be verified and a Thursday meeting with Pentagon officials to discuss the return of remains of Americans soldiers killed during the Korean War.  Mr Pompeo sought to dispel suggestions that the Trump administration has backed down from demanding the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of the North\u0026rsquos nuclear weapons.

Mr Gove would likely be a contender in any future leadership contest, which could influence his decision on whether to spearhead Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans for Brexit.  Boris Johnson  The Foreign Secretary backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans during the meeting was like \u0026ldquopolishing a turd.

The initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.  The strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.  The Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.  Alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.  Launching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.  \u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.  \u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.  A study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.  The mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.  Separate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.  The motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth buying.  \u0026ldquoThese Road to Vision Zero proposals are a step in the right direction but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars."},{"url":null,"title":"broch players to strike a pose at bridal bash","story":"        The largest wedding and gift exhibition in the north east, the Big Buchan Bridal Bash, will return to Fraserburgh later this year.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Monday 9 Jul 2018 9:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Monday 9 Jul 2018 9:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765906.1531125482!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith brexit no longer means brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765653.1530992976!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm laws governing eu referendum proved meaningless","story":"        Without a criminal sanction or  the threat of a re-run, Vote Leave can cock a snook at the Electoral Commission, says Euan McColm                Imagine you’re unhappy with your television. The screen’s too small, the sound’s terrible and, frankly, nobody much enjoyed watching that last match round at your place.            There’s only one thing for it: you’re going to have to shell out a couple of grand on a new one.            Unfortunately, you’ve already spent the last of your savings on lottery tickets and artisan gin so the need for a TV simply cannot be met with the \u2028resources you have available. So what do you do?You could do the right thing and save a bit, maybe buy a new flat-screen next year, or you could, I suppose, stroll confidently into John Lewis, unhook a fancy Sony from the wall and march out with it under your arm.And, if a security guard stopped you by the front door, you could try explaining that it was the will of the people that you had a new TV.You wouldn’t do that, though, would you? There’s a law against you stealing things, even when you really, really want them. If you get caught in the act, you don’t get to keep your ill-gotten gains, you get to visit your local police station and you get to have a criminal record that might well ruin your life.Steal a referendum result, on the other hand, and – even if you get caught – you get to keep your winnings.            READ MORE: Official Brexit campaign ‘broke electoral law’Last week, the Vote Leave campaign, which celebrated victory in the 2016 EU referendum, leaked news that the Electoral Commission was set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.In what appeared to be an effort to take back control of this particular story, this particular group of  Brexiteers let it be known that the commission had accused them of breaking their official spending limit of £7 million by passing donations to another campaign group – BeLeave – with which it was allegedly co-ordinating operations.If, indeed, Vote Leave did break electoral law during the campaign, one might be forgiven for expecting that there would be some pretty serious consequences.             After all, ignoring the law in order to win a referendum that will change the course of British history might be considered a more serious matter than half-inching a telly.If the law on spending limits – put in place (and here’s a laugh) to stop the wealthy simply buying victories – really meant anything, there would be police involvement. As it is, this piece of civil, rather than criminal, law is utterly worthless.The toughest sanction available to the electoral commission is the imposition of a fine of up to £20,000. To a millionaire campaigner willing to ignore the law, that might seem like very good value indeed.The spin from pro-Brexit politicians, campaigners, and commentators is that none of this had any impact on the result of the referendum a majority would have voted Leave, regardless of the amount any of the participants had spent. If this is so, one wonders why they felt the need to spend anything on the campaign at all.Remainers hoping that the Electoral Commission’s findings might have some impact on the result are to be disappointed.             It’s no wonder Vote Leave was so relaxed about revealing some of the detail of its own alleged misdeeds.But this scandal – and it is a bloody scandal, regardless of how it might be dismissed by the braying Brexiteers of Little England – should have consequences for future elections and referendums. It is time for spending on campaigns to be a matter of criminal rather than civil law.I fear, however, that we will see little appetite for this necessary change from the main political parties.It is an open secret that participants in elections regularly ignore the rules and regulations that are supposed to ensure financial fair play. As one campaigner put it to me last week: “We all do it and nobody wants to make an issue of it. If we start throwing accusations at our opponents, they’ll start throwing accusations at us. Everyone’s hands are dirty.”This cosy, all-in-the-sewer-together understanding makes a mockery of already toothless legislation surrounding spending limits.An especially bleak irony of the electoral commission’s findings, as leaked by Vote Leave, is that the Brexit campaign was driven by a populist message that departure from the EU would empower those who felt left behind by “political elites” or “the establishment” when the reality, it appears, is that the only people truly empowered by it are a financial elite whose contempt for the law (for what it is currently worth, which is nothing) is out there in the open, now, for all to see.When those who value “Britishness” talk about what it actually means, they will tell you that they pride themselves on our collective sense of fair play.If those Brexiteers who made so much about British values during the 2016 campaign truly meant what they say, they would be clamouring for a re-run of the referendum. A result obtained by murky means, with the law ignored, is surely fundamentally un-British, isn’t it?Anyone who dares to question the validity of a victory secured by a campaign that broke electoral law should expect to be dismissed as an out-of-touch “Remoaner”. The rag-bag of libertarians, right-wing obsessives, and downright racists who are currently pushing for Brexit at any cost will have their way.I can’t see any good reason that anyone – regardless of their political position – would oppose turning the regulation of campaign funding from a civil to a criminal matter. After all, don’t we all want to ensure the high standards politicians talk about to be a reality rather than just another bit of meaningless spin?The EU referendum result will have consequences for generations to come. Those who secured that victory may consider themselves very fortunate indeed that the law governing the way the referendum was conducted is meaningless."},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment brexit s true impact on our national health service","story":"        DURING 2016\u0026#8217s referendum on EU membership, those arguing most passionately in favour of a Leave vote were adamant that one of the main beneficiaries would be the National Health Service.                Without the need to pay for membership of the European club, went the argument, the UK could invest £350million-a-week in the NHS. Campaigners making this entirely dubious claim went so far as to emblazon it on the side of a bus, a cynical but effective move that helped perpetuate what The Scotsman regards as the myth that membership of the EU represented a drag on the UK economy.            The truth is that Brexit is set to have major impact on the health service but not in the positive way Leavers insisted.            It will not have escaped the attention of anyone who has used the NHS in recent years that it depends for the maintenance of acceptable standards upon the services of a great many staff who are not UK citizens.Uncertainty over the status of these staff post Brexit should be a matter of the gravest concern for us all.Gung-ho hardline Brexiteers may argue that the UK should walk away from the EU without any kind of deal. We believe this to be a dangerously reckless approach.A new report makes clear that a no-deal Brexit would impact on staffing not to just in hospitals but beyond.The social care sector - providing nursing and support services to the elderly and disabled in their own homes - currently employs 10,000 EU nationals in Scotland.            These staff are now living under a dark cloud of uncertainty while Eurosceptics across the political spectrum flex their muscles and demand that the “will of the people” be satisfied, no matter what.We do not believe it was the will of those people who voted Leave to bring the health and social care sectors to their knees.Prime Minister Theresa May has, in recent days, begun to show a little more steel in her dealings with the Eurosceptics in her party. While she is in this frame of mind, we hope she will take the necessary step of making clear that, whatever form Brexit takes, health and care workers who have devoted themselves to building careers here will be welcome to remain and that she will not prevent employers from bringing in more workers if necessary."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765145.1531123829!/image/image.jpg","title":"nick freer comment thinking outside the box to attract digital talent","story":"        I wrote last week about one of this country\u0026#8217s top venture capitalists and his view that in order to succeed in all things tech, we need an increasing pool of local digital and IT talent together with more senior managers experienced in global growth.                This stacks up with ScotlandIS’s annual survey which found that the local marketplace is anticipated to provide the bulk of new people talent, with 70 per cent of respondent companies expecting to recruit from within Scotland in 2018. No huge surprises here and a more interesting finding was around a marked increase in company demand for modern apprentices, with almost half of respondents saying they would recruit in this way.              Peter Proud, CEO and founder of Cortex Worldwide whose cloud-based technology platform includes Microsoft as a key client, says the group’s graduate apprenticeship scheme is “the second best thing we’ve done after founding the company.” Proud praises the work of ecosystem players like Skills Development Scotland (SDS) and Edinburgh Napier University to support further learning and employers, the overall engagement of the Scottish Government and says that the performance of Cortex’s graduate apprentices have “at least matched, in some cases exceeded” that of traditional university graduates. Cortex’s CEO, who will shortly take up a board position with ScotlandIS, also says his team is actively looking to hire from digital skills academy CodeClan over the next few weeks.              CodeClan deserves a special mention here, with around 600 people set to have graduated from its 16-week Professional Software Development Course by the end of the year. Key to CodeClan’s long-term success will be expanding the network of commercial and public sector employers who take on its graduates. George Elliott, Craneware’s chairman and a former Wolfson Microelectronics finance chief, reminded me last week not to forget about other skill sets: “It’s not just digital skills that we need but also commercial skills and knowledge of how to scale, market and sell the technology.” Elliott, whose track record of selling into the North American market during his time at Wolfson is nothing short of legendary, says we are better at this in Scotland than we were but we have to do more to compete effectively.   The CEO of one of Scotland’s most highly rated scale-ups, John Peebles of Administrate, says there is “a massive skills gap within the industry for people who are not engineers but have worked at large, scaling global tech start-ups. The skills shortage will become an acute choke point for the local tech industry within the next three years as local start-ups begin to mature.”Susanne Mitschke, CEO and founder of MindMate, which develops apps to manage dementia from a headquarters in Glasgow with an investor base of US VCs, thinks Scotland has a very good standing when it comes to digital talent. Mitschke says: “We use the University of Glasgow’s recruitment system to find graduates and the quality has been fantastic. I see many other companies, in places like London, Berlin and the US who have trouble finding software developers, particularly affordable ones.”    In big news in Scotland’s informatics circles, David Richardson, currently director of partnerships at the University of Edinburgh’s soon to be opened Bayes Centre, is set to move to Heriot-Watt later this year to take up the position of chief entrepreneurial executive at the university’s new Discovery and Innovation Centre.

Here is the full text of David Davis’s resignation letter to Theresa May:            “Dear Prime Minister            “As you know there have been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line, ranging from accepting the Commission’s sequencing of negotiations through to the language on Northern Ireland in the December Joint Report.“At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.“I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.“Whether it is the progressive dilution of what I thought was a firm Chequers agreement in February on right to diverge, or the unnecessary delays of the start of the White Paper, or the presentation of a backstop proposal that omitted the strict conditions that I requested and believed that we hadagreed, the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one.            “The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem.• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisis“In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real.“As I said at Cabinet, the “common rule book” policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.            “I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions.“Of course this is a complex area of judgement and it is possible that you are right and I am wrong.“However, even in that event it seems to me that the national interest requires a Secretary of State in my Department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript.“While I have been grateful to you for the opportunity to serve, it is with great regret that I tender my resignation from the Cabinet with immediate effect.“Yours ever, David Davis”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765867.1531084886!/image/image.jpg","title":"one in seven expect to be paying off mortgage into their 70s","story":"        One in seven UK homeowners say they will still be paying off their mortgage at the age of 70, according to a survey.                The Aegon study found 14 per cent of those surveyed were expecting still to be making payments on their home at retirement age. More than 40 per cent said they would likely still be renting at 70.            More than 700 people aged between 18 and 64 were questioned in the survey, which also predicted an increase in “lifetime renters”.            Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said a combination of homeowners getting on the housing ladder, higher house prices and longer borrowing terms were the main factors in the response.He said: “Paying off your mortgage in time for your 70th birthday is now far from a given. Inflated property prices mean those getting onto the property ladder are doing so at later ages and are borrowing more for longer. Those left with an outstanding mortgage on their property face the prospect of either budgeting mortgage payments into their retirement or alternatively continuing to work.“We know that one in four people expect to still be working at 70, but not everyone will be fit enough or want to do so.”Mr Cameron continued: “As younger generations increasingly fail to get onto the property ladder, renting a home becomes the long-term plan.”The results of the survey came after a Freedom of Information request by insurer Royal London found pensioners paid a total of £24 billion in income tax in 2015/16.            According to the findings, Scottish pensioners paid as much as £1.7bn of the total bill, more than Wales and Northern Ireland combined. The tax paid by pensioners would be on various sources of income such as employment, self-employment and property.Royal London found that between the mid-1990s and the mid-2010s, the number of taxpayers aged over 65 had nearly doubled from 3.32 million in 1995/96 to 6.49 million in 2015/16 – the most recent year for which detailed figures are available.It is estimated that the number has broadly stabilised since then and stands at around 6.37 million in 2018/19, Royal London said.Sir Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said: “Many people might assume that once you retire you cease to be of interest to the taxman, but these figures show that this is very far from being the truth.            “The number of tax-paying pensioners has nearly doubled in the last two decades and with talk of requiring pensioners to pay national insurance on earnings, the older population may think of themselves as ‘generation still taxed’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nMonday 9 Jul 2018 9:44

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today. It is fitting therefore that his name will forever be associated with Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and with the development of Kilbeg village, a new sustainable Highland community which places Gaelic language and culture very much at its heart.”\nMs Forbes, extending her own congratulations to Mr McQuarrie, said: “This recognition of Duncan MacQuarrie is well deserved for his years of commitment to the Gaelic language and Sabhal Mòr Ostaig. The opportunities afforded to a new generation of Gaelic speakers are thanks to people like Duncan MacQuarrie who had the sheer determination, vision and love for the language to persevere. \u0026#8220Today, the education, employment and cultural opportunities enable Gaelic speakers to live and work in their preferred language in a way that would not have been possible without Mr MacQuarrie\u0026#8217s efforts.\u0026#8221\nPlans for the next phase of the affordable housing site \u0026#8211 which will soon be submitted for full planning consents \u0026#8211 will be delivered through a creative partnership involving Sabhal Mòr Ostaig the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, the Highland Council and the private sector and will see the creation of up to 31 units of housing on the site.\nThe units will comprise a range of models and types of tenure, including rent to buy, self-build, housing for the elderly and, affordable for-rent housing.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
