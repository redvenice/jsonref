Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It was blasted along with another sacred site on Sunday.Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy or damage the site in 2013 under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, which were drafted in 1972 to favour mining proponents.One year after consent was granted, an archeological dig intended to salvage whatever could be saved discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in artefacts, including sacred objects.Most precious was a 4,000-year-old length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people, which DNA testing revealed were the direct ancestors of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners living today.But the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act does not allow for a consent to be renegotiated on the basis of new information. So despite regular meetings with Rio Tinto, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation was unable to stop the blast from going ahead.“It’s one of the most sacred sites in the Pilbara region … we wanted to have that area protected,” PKKP director Burchall Hayes told  Australia.“It is precious to have something like that plaited hair, found on our country, and then have further testing link it back to the Kurrama people. It’s something to be proud of, but it’s also sad. Its resting place for 4,000 years is no longer there.”Hayes said the site had been used as a campsite by Kurrama moving through the area, including in the memory of some elders.“We want to do the same, we want to show the next generation,” he said. “Now, if this site has been destroyed, then we can tell them stories but we can’t show them photographs or take them out there to stand at the rock shelter and say: this is where your ancestors lived, starting 46,000 years ago.”The Aboriginal Heritage Act has been up for review, in some form, since 2012. Draft legislation put forward by the former Liberal government in 2014 was rejected after even a National party MP argued it was unfair to traditional owners and did not allow for adequate consultation.Re-writing the act was listed as a priority for Labor before their election win in 2017, and last month Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt pushed back the final consultation on his draft bill until later this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.The new legislation will provide options to appeal or amend agreements to allow for the destruction of heritage sites, Wyatt said. He wasn’t aware of the risk to the Juukan site, or its destruction, until Monday.“It will provide for agreements between traditional owners and proponents to include a process to consider new information that may come to light, and allow the parties to be able to amend the agreements by mutual consent,” he said. “The legislation will also provide options for appeal should either party not be compliant with the agreement.”In its submission to the legislative review, Rio Tinto said it was broadly supportive of the proposed reform but that consent orders granted under the current system should be carried over, and that rights of appeal should be fixed, not broad or subject to extensions, lest it “prolong approvals or appeals processes at a critical point in the project.”A spokesman from Rio Tinto said the company had a relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people dating back three decades, “and we have been working together in relation to the Juukan area over the past 17 years”.“Rio Tinto has worked constructively together with the PKKP People on a range of heritage matters and has, where practicable, modified its operations to avoid heritage impacts and to protect places of cultural significance to the group,” the company said.The mining company signed a native title agreement with the traditional owners in 2011, four years before their native title claim received formal assent by the federal court. They facilitated the salvage dig in 2014, which uncovered the true age of the site.Archeologist Dr Michael Slack, who led that dig, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.An earlier 1 metre test dig, conducted in 2008, dated the site at about 20,000 years old, but the salvage expedition uncovered a “very significant site” with more than 7,000 artefacts collected, including grid stones that were 40,000 years old, thousands of bones from middens which showed changes in fauna as the climate changed, and sacred objects.The flat floor of the cave allowed for a significant depth of soil and sand to build up, creating a layer almost two metres deep in parts. Most archeological digs in the Pilbara hit rock at 30cm.Most significantly, the archeological records did not disappear during the last ice age. Most inland archeological sites in Australia show that people moved away during the ice age between 23,000 and 19,000 years ago, as the country dried up and water sources dried up. Archeological evidence from Juukan Gorge suggest it was occupied throughout.“It was the sort of site you do not get very often, you could have worked there for years,” he said. “How significant does something have to be, to be valued by wider society?” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d8a3bc6c969c32adfc5589f2729e1419f31b72/22_375_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9cd589d63878c29760c70c4ee2dc21b","title":"aston martin sacking chief share andy palmer tobias moers","story":"Andy Palmer, who had been head of car firm since 2014, will be replaced by Tobias MoersThe luxury carmaker Aston Martin has confirmed it has sacked its chief executive Andy Palmer as part of a wider board overhaul, following a collapse in its share price and a slump in sales because of the coronavirus pandemic.Palmer’s replacement, Tobias Moers, will join on 1 August from Mercedes-AMG, where he is the boss of the German carmaker’s high-performance ision.Palmer had served as Aston Martin’s chief executive since 2014, and the company confirmed his departure after reports over the weekend. Palmer left the company on Monday.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets, said the reaction from investors was “a pretty damning indictment of his tenure that the shares jumped this much after news of his sacking.”He added: “Aston Martin has been one of the worst stock listings in living memory. Things had already got pretty horrendous before this year the coronavirus outbreak has been the coup de grace.”Lawrence Stroll, a billionaire who became the executive chair of Aston Martin after leading a £536m rescue deal in March, said: “The board has determined that now is the time for new leadership to deliver our plans. On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Andy for his hard work, personal commitment and dedication to Aston Martin Lagonda since 2014.”The company’s chief manufacturing operations officer, Keith Stanton, will oversee operations until Moers takes up the top job.The change at the top comes after a difficult few months at Aston Martin. The British company, best known as the maker of James Bond’s cars, came close to going bust for the eighth time in its 107-year history.Over the weekend, Palmer told the Financial Timesthat he was unaware he was due to be sacked and declined to comment further.In the company statement to the stock exchange on Tuesday, Palmer said: “It has been a privilege to serve Aston Martin Lagonda for almost six years. The launch of many new products including the new DBX demonstrates the dedication and capability of our employees.“I would like to thank my management team and all the staff for their hard work and support, particularly during the challenges presented by Covid-19.”The company said it had not yet finalised Palmer’s “termination arrangements”. His £1.2m salary, plus an additional £153,000 in pension contributions and benefits, had been previously criticised by investors who were disappointed by the company’s performance.Palmer’s potential bonus and share awards were worth £6m annually if certain targets were met, although he did not receive a bonus for 2019.At the time of the company’s stock-market listing, Palmer received 3.27m shares worth £62.2m at the float price of £19 per share. He immediately sold £29.2m worth of shares to settle tax and national insurance due, and was allowed by the company to sell a further £6.6m of shares and keep the proceeds.Aston Martin also announced the appointment of Peter Espenhahn as chair of the audit and risk committee and Lord Carrington as chair of the remuneration committee.Stroll agreed in recent weeks to inject more than £75m in short-term funding to enable the company to fight off a cash crunch as it battled stock market turmoil.Earlier this month, Aston Martin reported a loss of £119m for the first quarter of the year, which pushed its shares to a record low. The company said Moers had a track record of turning businesses around and Stroll added: “He is the right leader for Aston Martin Lagonda as we implement our strategy for the business to achieve its full potential.”Aston Martin, like other European carmakers, was forced to stop production for several weeks because of the coronavirus crisis. It closed its two factories at its main site at Gaydon in Warwickshire and its facility at St Athan in south Wales, which had been preparing to start production of its DBX SUV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc2c4c9f16bf3cac7697de38d3db06272e20db91/0_156_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e78f8beeecdcad9c94550735e128b0a4","title":"greggs to reopen 800 stores from mid june","story":"Menu has been slimmed-down, but includes the bakery chain’s popular vegan sausage rollGreggs’ popular vegan sausage roll – and its bestselling meat equivalent – are to make a return next month, after the bakery chain revealed it is to reopen 800 stores across the UK from mid-June.The move follows a successful trial of the reopening of a handful of branches in the north-east earlier this month, when Greggs tested safety measures put in place to protect staff and customers.The chain temporarily closed all its 2,050 stores on 24 March as lockdown restrictions came into force, even though the new government rules specified that kitchen areas could stay open for takeaway orders.It subsequently changed its mind about plans to reopen 20 of its locations, fearing that enthusiastic customers might gather in crowds.A Greggs spokeswoman said: “We have planned and delivered robust shop trials using our new operational safety measures and they have progressed well, allowing us to now move to open an increased number of our shops from mid-June.”It will be offering a slimmed-down menu, but its vegan sausage roll and longer-established pork version will feature, along with hot drinks.The UK’s fast food and coffee shop chains are accelerating their reopening plans now that the initial lockdown measures are gradually being eased. UK restaurants and pubs have been allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery in spite of the lockdown, with many providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers.McDonald’s has reopened 33 drive-through restaurants in London and the South-East with more to come in the North, while rival Burger King has reopened around 50 branches for drive-through and delivery. At the weekend KFC hit the milestone of 500 restaurant openings – more than half its 964-strong estate in the UK and Ireland, including 350 drive-through outlets.On Tuesday the peri-peri chicken chain Nando’s announced the reopening of a further 54 outlets for delivery and click and collection across the UK and Ireland, with 40 more due to reopen on Wednesday. It had until now only reopened six for delivery orders in London and Manchester, and click-and-collect to customers at other sites including Belfast, Maidstone, Sevenoaks and Worcester.All delivery orders placed through the Nando’s website are eligible for reward points or ‘chillies’, which can be redeemed when the restaurants open their doors for a full dine-in service later in the year.The menu will be reduced to help the team maintain social distancing in the kitchen and food preparation areas, but Nando’s favourites such as peri-peri chicken wings, butterfly chicken, halloumi sticks and peri-peri chips will all be available to enjoy at home. Designated waiting areas have been set up for drivers and collect customers and order volumes will be monitored to avoid queues building up.Meanwhile Subway has reopened 600 of its 2,600 sandwich stores across the UK and Ireland.

This could take longer to become apparent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1661a6a548342047f6e8d5e7673637c93553f94/0_337_4673_2805/master/4673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a7a41d155d7c669c10a1f9c53fa160e","title":"uk recession bank of england economist andy haldane","story":"Andy Haldane says latest data is ‘a shade better’ than forecast but caution remainsBritain’s economy is on course for a shallower recession than feared after a series of surveys showed business activity has recovered at a modest rate, the Bank of England’s chief economist said.Andy Haldane said recent data was coming in “a shade better” than a scenario for the economy published by the central bank earlier this month, but risks remained that the recovery could be slower as companies and consumers remained cautious.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.It said a rapid recovery should be expected next year, leading to its scenario being viewed as relatively rapid V-shaped.“This is perhaps still a V but perhaps a fairly lopsided V,” he said, referring to the shape of the economy’s downturn and recovery. “The risks to that probably ... lie to the downside rather than the up and as I say, a rather more protracted recovery even than the one that I have mentioned.”Haldane’s recasting of the Bank’s outlook follows a poll of City economists last week that showed they view the downturn over the coming months as less severe than Bank of England’s policymakers.This prediction came as IHS Markit said its composite index – measuring activity in the dominant services sector and in manufacturing – rose to 28.9 in May’s preliminary from 13.8 in April’s final reading, revealing a stronger bounce back in business confidence than earlier estimates. PMIs below 50 represent a decline in activity.Speaking at a CBI webinar on Tuesday, Haldane also played down the prospect of an emergency cut in interest rates to below zero as a way to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis.It followed comments last week by Bank of England governor that the central bank would consider pushing borrowing costs below zero if it considered that the policy would help businesses stay afloat.Haldane said the key factors for the Bank to consider were the consequences of negative interest rates for Britain’s banks and lenders, which would trigger a squeeze on margins, and how such a move would affect confidence in the broader economy.“Those are the aspects that we will look at. To be clear, reviewing and doing are different things, and currently we are in the review phase and have not reached a view remotely yet on the doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bc473e07f4a71d53a41b7f2a2bf6a7337e748da/0_44_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e21191872f09924db47edee8209f6c64","title":"cummings contempt lockdown rules public catholic church ireland","story":"The Catholic church in Ireland lost power by flouting the morals it prescribed. The Tory government risks a similar fateIt is not news that Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings treat rules with contempt. But there is one rule even they might be expected to obey, because it is crucial to the maintenance of power. Never, ever, make the people who place their faith in you feel like fools.Or, to put it another way, never let the people who think they are making a sacrifice realise that in fact they are the sacrifice. Before breaking this rule so flagrantly, Johnson and his consigliere would have done well to consider the fate of what used to be one of the most powerful institutions on these islands: the Irish Catholic church.Watching the Cummings road movie made me think, disturbingly enough, of my mother. She was, for almost all of her life, a devout Catholic – and it’s the “almost” that is most interesting. She was a kind and compassionate woman, and she did not judge other people. But she followed the rules. There was one rule in particular she found awfully hard: the church’s ban on contraception. But she believed in the authority of the church. She made the sacrifices, and did what she was told.I will never forget her rage and disgust when, in her late 70s and early 80s, she discovered that the same church she loved and obeyed had been covering up the sexual abuse of children for decades. She was revolted by those crimes, of course. But she also felt that the bishops had made a mockery of her faith. They made her feel gullible. Her belief that she and the people she looked up to were together in this thing, that they had shared a tough commitment and the pain it involved, had turned out to be a charade.She was not alone. And there was no going back from this moment of betrayal. The authority of the church melted away in the heat of this anger. For while people forgive their leaders a great deal – often far too much – there is no forgiveness for that terrible moment when you realise that the anguish you have endured for the greater good was, to those in authority, just a mark of your credulousness and inferiority.If Cummings were half as smart as he is supposed to be, he would have shown in his press conference some glimmer of understanding that this kind of betrayal is of a completely different order to the one he and Johnson engage in so routinely. The ordinary treachery of saying one thing and doing another – there will be £350m extra every week for the NHS there will never be a border in the Irish Sea – is mother’s milk to them. Perhaps because it is so habitual or because they are so used to getting away with it, their sense of how it works has become dulled. They missed the crucial fact that this time it’s different. This time it’s personal.The mundane duplicity that is Cummings’ and Johnson’s stock in trade comes with a knowing smirk: you didn’t really think we meant that literally, did you? It is part of an elaborate, highly performative, game. But the rules for collective survival in a pandemic are not ironic. They are intimate. They are embodied. They are the detailed texture of the lives we live every day. Like the rule that said Catholics must not use contraceptives, they inhabit people’s most private selves. You mock those selves at your peril.If we were all coolly rational creatures, the reasons why Cummings should not be anywhere near the levers of power in a self-respecting democracy would already have been abundantly clear. His contempt for law and order was obvious from Vote Leave’s flouting of funding rules in the 2016 Brexit referendum. His scorn for the very idea that he might be held to ordinary standards of public accountability was amply demonstrated by his literal contempt for a parliamentary committee looking into that abuse. But he got away with that stuff.So why does his odyssey during lockdown produce a whole different kind of emotion? Because it reaches into the innermost experiences of millions of people. It cuts right through to the pain of a loved one dying alone, of grandchildren growing distant, of precious human bonds being forcibly severed. It grabs hold of that torment and it squeezes the meaning out of it.We endure these things inidually because we understand ourselves to be also enduring them collectively. Cummings’ actions – and, even more, Johnson’s valorisation of them – strip away the second part. The big, communal and institutional structure that gives a value to the millions of inidual sacrifices has been kicked away – in Johnson’s defence of Cummings, the only value is the inidual “instinct” of the members of the ruling caste. To use the Blitz analogy that England apparently cannot escape, it’s fine to leave your lights on during the blackout if you’re an important person with documents to read.As the Catholic church found in Ireland, people don’t forgive this violation of the sense of meaning that gives dignity to their own sufferings. They don’t forgive because they can’t forget. This kind of betrayal is not just an event out there in the public world of media and politics and power. It is an experience that happens to every citizen inidually and privately. It is not possible for people to think about it without thinking of love and loss, of the grief they have felt and the intimacies they have foregone. To do so is to hear, as the soundtrack to the images stored from these months in the mind and the heart, an unpardonable snigger of elite condescension.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/279f1942fc2d274e2eae78a88cb0862d61d88cce/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05a9d4ead7fe72d02455e10130262758","title":"dominic cummings lockdown rules coronavirus","story":"A sense of shared responsibility has been crucial during the coronavirus crisis. Let’s hope it hasn’t been shatteredDuring his rose garden press conference, Dominic Cummings was asked if his trip to Durham had undermined government public health messaging. I hope not, he replied. Later, Boris Johnson was asked the same question. His response was more definitive: no one in No 10 has undermined the messaging. I hope they are right. For this matters. If people stop listening to what the government asks them to do and if they stop adhering to coronavirus measures then the number of infections will rise and more people will die.But I cannot be as certain or as optimistic as the prime minister and his adviser. All that we know about adherence (knowledge that behavioural scientists have repeatedly stressed to the government during the pandemic) suggests that damage has been done.First, for all the complexities of Cummings’ story, the bottom line is very simple. While millions of people up and down the land faced agonising personal circumstances and decided to stick with lockdown, Cummings did not. He went to Durham at the very time his government was insisting “stay at home, don’t travel”. He went to a beauty spot at the very time his government was insisting we avoid them. And nothing has happened to him. Instead, his actions have been endorsed. At the very least, that gives the appearance of “one rule for them, another for us” (possibly the best way of corroding trust in authority and adherence to the rules). And Cummings more than anyone else understands the importance of appearance in politics.Second, the one thing that has carried us through the pandemic so far has been an emergent sense of community. This “we” feeling has been critical in getting people to adhere to the restrictions, even when they personally were not at risk. It has been critical to all the volunteering and neighbourhood support that has helped us through hardship. It is the most valuable asset we have in a crisis. But the most notable thing about Cummings’ rose garden performance was that “we” was nowhere to be found. It was all about “I”.His explanation was entirely about his judgments as an inidual, his decisions, his personal concerns. At no point was there any thought to the impact of his actions on others. Still worse, in his defence of Cummings on Sunday, the prime minister seemed to endorse the idea that, when the going gets tough, it is fine to rely on your own judgments – and fine to follow your inidual “instincts”.In effect, Johnson’s defence of Cummings turned an issue of communal responsibility into an issue of inidual preference. Had everyone done that – had we all put so much energy into thinking about loopholes that served our personal circumstances rather than thinking about the impact of our actions on others – then lockdown would not have worked, the infection would still be raging and the NHS would have been overwhelmed.As we come out of lockdown these issues become, if anything, even more important. It isn’t that the infection has gone away. Rather we are now in a position, due to past sacrifices by the many, to use more targeted strategies against coronavirus. But these are dependent on us all maintaining physical distancing, increasing hygiene standards, revealing our contacts if infected and observing quarantine if contacted. All of these measures are personally inconvenient. Often it will be easier to ignore them. They will only work if we continue to act together and for each other.I hope this will happen. I hope people will continue to demonstrate the remarkable solidarity they have shown so far. I hope the collective spirit won’t be damaged. But this sorry affair doesn’t help, and the more they defend themselves, the more our top politician and his top adviser demonstrate that they don’t even appreciate what the problems are. • Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, an adviser to the UK and Scottish governments on coronavirus and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f61483d956a5b9b784807a246b0599f859afee89/244_246_2403_1441/master/2403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2f07086ddd3aa5c67fce9378253f6d","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of minimal","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘minimal’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘minimal’.Share your photos of what minimal means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 May at 10am.

With three younger siblings at home, she has to take on “a lot of responsibility for helping out”. Even in normal times, school is a haven for her. Over the past seven weeks it has become even more than that: an oasis of calm.Rednock secondary is a specialist science college in the small market town of Dursley, Gloucestershire. This is not the affluent north Cotswolds of honeyed stone cottages, and the school is a typical comprehensive. Usually 1,500 students troop through its gates every morning. Today, 42 pupils are in.At the moment there is one teacher to four students, which means pupils such as Caitlin can be given unprecedented tailored pastoral and academic support, without the usual pressures of time. “I think without school right now I’d be an emotional mess,” Caitlin says with a nervous smile. “It’s my GCSEs and I’m worried – we’re missing a massive chunk of learning. But I’ve had a teacher to help me whenever I’ve wanted. It’s given me that extra confidence.”Here at Rednock, pupils have been encouraged to try a huge range of new creative and practical activities: knitting, Zumba, TikTok, baking, kite-making and sign language.The school has ripped up timetables in a way no state school could normally contemplate. “We’ve said, we will be completely flexible to your needs,” says Kerala Cole, assistant headteacher. “We work in partnership with parents to personalise the deal for the students. It can be that they come in for just a couple of hours. And I think we are seeing huge benefits to that.”One boy who had refused to attend for eight months, has been coming in every day, thanks to this flexibility and the attention he can now be given. Another year 8 child, “who arrived midway through this year and has been struggling … he’s been attending for four weeks now and he’s really benefited”, says Cole. “You can just see how his shoulders have relaxed.”The gap in GCSE results between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest is thought to be around 19 months and, without changes in policy priorities, at the current rate it will take 50 years to close, according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank.Many fear children will fall even further behind during the pandemic, one reason the government gives for wanting to reopen schools to more pupils by 1 June. Rednock was hoping some 240 pupils would attend during lockdown, but numbers have been lower than expected.The corridors of the school’s spacious modern building are hushed. Children walk around alone, and don’t wear uniform. For many, “strange school” has huge advantages. “Before, I had quite a few classmates who were really annoying and distracting, but now this new way, it’s quieter,” says Edie, 13.“Teachers are ever so supportive, and it’s calmer because there’s not tonnes of people crowding around,” adds Molly, 11.“There’s less people who intimidate other people,” says Alfie, 12, whose parents, both nurses, have been at work during the crisis. “You can be yourself more rather than be the person other people think you should be.” His mum has had Covid-19, he says, and has recovered.Everyone nods. “Before, people used to sometimes judge you,” says Samira, 11. “You can sometimes have fake friends who really bring you down. This has given you a little bit of a break.”Because the school is being so careful about physical distancing, I meet students in the hall, with one child per desk. This small group either have key-worker parents, are under the care of a social worker, have an education, health and care plan (EHCP) for their special needs, or are otherwise defined as “high priority” by their teachers. They miss their friends but, to a child, say they feel immense relief from the pressures of “normal” school.“The teachers have more time to spend with you, and you get the help you need,” says Maisie, 12, whose mother works in food manufacturing. Samira agrees. “Teachers feel more like family now.” There is enthusiastic nodding from her schoolmates.The headteacher, David Alexander, and Cole, went through their entire roll to identify pupils they felt should have the opportunity to attend – those who were vulnerable, although not in the government’s stated categories.“We want as many to come in as possible,” Alexander says. As schools closed across the country, Rednock staff telephoned 280 families to make sure they knew their child had a place. “Some parents and carers are hesitant,” Alexander acknowledges. “And some prefer to have their children at home.” But efforts are unstinting to support the 160 or so students who, Cole says, “we would class as vulnerable, and who we’d prefer to be in school but aren’t”.Cole feels anxious for the welfare of some children who haven’t been seen for the past seven weeks. She is in regular contact with their social workers and, in some cases, the police. Teachers continue to check in, ringing some children weekly, some daily. In school, staff are sensitive to new needs. “Some here have really difficult home lives and they feel safer in school. And they feel worried about their parents who are at work. We’ve had tears, shouting, aggression,” says Cole.“Or they go quiet, or go off on their own,” adds Alexander. “Or you get over-the-top laughter, or clinginess,” says Cole.When all students do come back, Alexander and Cole are hoping there will be lessons they can use from lockdown. They know, too, that the return of the hurley burley will affect the more vulnerable children.And the pupils have mixed feelings about normal school resuming. Samira hopes there might be smaller classes, but says: “I’m not excited about going back – all the madness and screaming in corridors.” Molly agrees.: “It’ll probably be more stressful. Everything crowded again.”Caitlin is looking to the positives. “I’ve had the opportunity to reflect on who I want to be when I’m older,” she says. “I can be quite negative, and this time has given me a break. The extra support from school means that I know even when things get tough – because we’re in a pandemic and I’m getting through it – I can get through other things now.”Alexander and Cole emphasise that even in normal times this school tries to create a family atmosphere. But to these children, a caring school has never felt as much of a reality as it does now. There is no testing or targets, no pressure to achieve academically. They feel adults are there for them. And despite the immense stresses and limitations of living in a time of pandemic, they are blossoming.* All children’s names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274312b947acca798a64e70ac6cca123ef4eac8/0_279_2726_1635/master/2726.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9db463b340b14a2b15a3461c5f9c3f66","title":"a look at the worlds most stylish men in pictures","story":"The Staley-Wise Gallery in New York is currently closed, but has plundered its archives to curate an online exhibition celebrating some of the world’s best-dressed men.

The wounds were still too fresh, some argued. Turning a national tragedy into something a person can pay $12 to watch while shoveling popcorn down their gullet struck detractors as perverse, though critics spilled a goodly amount of e-ink debating the actual merits of the work itself. The conversation trafficked in shades of grey, but it posed a clear question: when is it appropriate to start dramatizing an intimately terrible chapter of recent history?If the parties at the vanguard of the emerging coronasploitation cinema genre called the shots regarding the timeline on our collective creative processing of 911, pre-production would have launched between the fall of the first and second towers. It would appear that any trepidation about being too soon has been supplanted by a fear of being too late.Five years separated the United States’ last generation-defining catastrophe and its first Hollywood treatment, and yet hardly five seconds could elapse before the film industry went to work on The Great American Coronavirus Movie. No fewer than a half-dozen projects in various stages of development are already endeavoring to capture the chaos, the uncertainty, the sadness, and the hope for an America in need of inspiring. Though of course, that’s the most generous assessment – one can surmise that the minds behind Corona Zombies didn’t set out to heal the soul of a nation.That film, slapped together in record time by redubbing footage from an old Italian grindhouse flick and splicing it with news broadcasts for timeliness, represents the bottom of this particular barrel. The reek of cashing-in emanates most strongly from those productions wholeheartedly embracing their B-movie origins, such as the “The Ultimate Lockdown Film” 19 Covid Lane, a winking ripoff of 10 Cloverfield Lane in concept and design.Though Keshvari rushed through a three-day shoot before social distancing protocols ramped up, the bigger treatments still to come will have to contend with harsher restrictions. It’s been announced that Sliding Doors director Peter Howitt will tackle the pandemic as an Irwin Allen-style ensemble piece, tracking seven lives across Los Angeles over the course of 60 days. The Deadline exclusive breaking the news mentions that the producers are “eyeing” a launch of principal photography in September 2020, by which time they’re presumably banking that things will have returned to relative normalcy. Whether that’s an unduly optimistic start date will be determined in time, but even if that’s how the chips fall, it won’t be business as usual by any means.Michael Bay and the other producers behind the gestating Songbird plan on forging ahead, viral threat be damned. A report last week on Deadline detailed a schedule that has shooting commencing in five weeks’ time, employing novel means to make working on the streets of Los Angeles safe for the actors and crew. While the article refrains from specifying how that could possibly work, there’s mention of “remote training” for actors. More importantly, the guilds responsible for looking after the well-being of performers and craftspeople have all given the okay for these mystery methods. While a half-dozen issues immediately come to mind – how unmasked actors can share screen time, maintenance of proper distance for crew during takes, getting everyone fed when the craft services table provides a breeding ground for germs – some industry insiders are busying themselves figuring it all out.The most eyebrow-raising notice comes from the horror factory Blumhouse, where the top brass have been devising a new approach to working on a studio lot. They’re full steam ahead on a $6.5m genre picture to be shot on Universal’s sound stages, with a “set of safety protocols” in place. The specifics include an end to the craft services table, and more notably, putting up all of the cast and crew in a single hotel to contain the flow of contagions. A quote from a source at Universal makes clear that “Blumhouse and Universal aren’t moving forward with any plans until we get the green light from city, county and public-health officials.” However, the risk remains so great that no insurance company will agree to cover the production. If disaster strikes – as it did not so long ago, when Paul Walker died while working on Universal’s Furious 7 – Blumhouse and Universal will be left with a massive financial liability.Whether new laws change that much will number among the deciding factors in the evolution of a post-viral industry. That article from the Hollywood Reporter delves into the legal muck of this sticky situation, theorizing that Democrats in Congress will push new legislation requiring insurers to offer virus policies. That will be a long and arduous fight, however, with insurance corporations expected to push back as hard as possible on a mandate they see as setting them up for failure. Even if the film industry isn’t following its own example of post-911 delicacy, they’re hoping those chaotic days can still provide a precedent today in Washington following much debate and acrimony, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was passed in 2002 to force insurers to cover the eventuality of terrorist attacks.But there’s a disparity between the crisis that opened the millennium and the crisis unfolding now, a factor making them comparable and yet different enough that there would be no waiting period for Covid cinema. The vast majority of Americans related only symbolically to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, a broadside against America that we all were supposed to fight as vicarious patriots. Everyone feels a sense of ownership over the coronavirus quagmire, because it has affected every single citizen’s life in an immediate, perceptible way. This has freed up Hollywood (and the wannabes lurking around its fringes) to claim these stories as their own for the telling. But that ubiquity is a double-edged sword. If we all share in custody of the story’s drama, we all share its hazards as well. Any film-maker hoping to capitalize on the fact that we’ve all been touched by the virus must also accept that that leaves the possibility of having been literally touched by the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f71f4e06958cf7363ea03fbadd3fd94bb59fa5de/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daa6da7c15c4eeb425f266d0a3b8fd41","title":"on the record russell simmons hbo max","story":"The makers and subjects of On the Record talk about bringing alleged sexual abuse by Russell Simmons to light and why Oprah Winfrey disowned the filmIn mid-December 2017, two months after reporting on Harvey Weinstein triggered what is now known as the #MeToo movement, Drew Dixon bought a copy of the New York Times at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, where she moved 25 years prior as a starry-eyed college grad determined to work in music. On the front page was a story titled Three Allege Music Mogul Raped Them, with her name in the first sentence. Dixon thumbed through the pages, finding her black-and-white photo – steely-eyed, braced – central on the page, then turned to her phone, a portal to reactions and blowback for speaking publicly about allegations of rape and sexual harassment by her former boss, the music mogul Russell Simmons. Scrolling, anonymous under her beanie, she silently cried.The moment, captured on camera by documentarians Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick arrives about two-thirds of the way through On the Record, a HBO Max film notionally about the women, particularly Dixon, who spoke publicly of assault and abuse by Simmons. But the film offers a larger emotional window: into the experience of reprocessing buried trauma, of music careers thwarted by abuse and shame, of grappling with the weight of public knowledge and, in particular, the weight of coming forward as a black woman against a hero in the black community. (Simmons has denied all accusations.)The film watches Dixon as she considers speaking to the Times, the consequences of reopening a wound in public and the surreality of seeing your story rehashed in push alerts and tweets. “I definitely underestimated the emotional wrecking ball that coming forward would be for me in December 2017,” Dixon told the . “I thought I was going to deposit this information in the public square and then I would walk back into my private life.”But her relationship to her story changed it went from information “packed away neatly in my emotional basement” to “part of the vocabulary of my environment”, public knowledge hyperlinked throughout her life – at her son’s Little League games, when she’d see a text with another disclosure about Simmons, or stopped by a woman in tears on the tears. “Suddenly this information that I had buried was now coursing through my veins,” she said. “And it suddenly became a part of my identity in a way that just transformed me.”Sherri “Sheri Sher” Hines, one half of the pioneering hip-hop duo Mercedes Ladies, buried the trauma of her alleged rape by Simmons in the late 80s for years. “I was the type where I wouldn’t let you see me cry,” she told the . Though she found strength in the process of speaking on the record, in the Los Angeles Times, and later in On the Record, she wondered, with the film coming out: “how is it going to feel, having my vulnerability out there in the world? When there’s so many other things to me.”Simmons has been a fixture in the music industry since the early 80s – first as a promoter for Run-DMC, then as co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, the hip-hop label behind hits by LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and the Beastie Boys. The film focuses primarily on Dixon, who arrived in the city in 1992 and, after a couple of years in entry-level record label gigs, landed her dream job: A\u0026ampR executive at Def Jam. She was talented, hungry and above all passionate by age 24, the record she organized – a soundtrack for the rap documentary The Show, featuring tracks from A Tribe Called Quest and Tupac – went platinum.But by that point, she says, the harassment from Simmons became relentless. He shoved her into a broom closet at a restaurant and tried to kiss her, exposed himself to her in her office. Her description of the alleged rape in 1995, after Simmons lured her into his apartment under the guise of calling her a car home, is raw and devastating, all the more gutting for the similarities – manipulation, disembodiment as a survival mechanism, spiraling shame – it shares with the accounts of other Simmons accusers. (Twenty women have now accused him publicly).Dixon left Def Jam for Arista Records, where she shepherded hits by such stars as Whitney Houston, Lauryn Hill, and Aretha Franklin. But when L.A. Reid took over the label in 2000, she says, she was again faced rampant sexual harassment and “quid pro quo” propositions. (Reid has denied this account he was dismissed as CEO of Epic Records in 2017 for allegations of sexual harassment). The constant stress and shame drove Dixon to leave music in 2002, in the prime of her career, and to “bury that part of myself in like a manhole.”Though still “trying to get back to normal” throughout 2018, Dixon agreed to speak again in On the Record in large part because of Ziering and Dick’s focus on the Me Too experience for black women. With interviews from academics and activists including Tarana Burke, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Joan Morgan, and former editor of the Source Kierna Mayo, the film adds historical and cultural context to what Dixon and other Simmons survivors describe as their reluctance to tear down a powerful, beloved black cultural figure – the myth of the hyper-sexual black male that underpinned the terror of lynchings, the long history of black women putting racial solidarity before gender, the misogyny rampant in hip-hop (and, as the film notes with clips of casual sexism by Mick Jagger and Tom Jones, all music genres).That focus was part of what convinced Oprah Winfrey to sign on as executive producer after seeing a rough cut in June 2019, thus bringing the project under her Apple TV+ distribution deal. So it was a confusing shock when Winfrey abruptly withdrew her support of the film just 15 days before its January premiere at Sundance, citing vague “inconsistencies”. (“I stand with the women, I support the women, and I do hope that people see the film,” Winfrey maintained on CBS in January). The withdrawal “blinded” the filmmakers, and created a cycle of re-traumatizing news that Dixon called, at the time, a “hellscape”.“There are no inconsistencies,” Dick told the  of those reports. “These stories were reported by the New York Times, the LA Times and the Hollywood Reporter and very extensively vetted.” That process included, according to the directors, their own fact-checking team, Harpo (Winfrey’s production company) and Apple lawyers, and HBO Max’s legal team. “We are very confident and we stand behind this film, we stand behind these women,” said Ziering.As for Dixon, “I am not at all in the same place with respect to Oprah Winfrey’s exit and Apple’s decision to walk away from the film,” said Dixon, adding that she’s “deeply grateful” to Winfrey for signing on as producer and for “maintaining her faith in our stories and her support for us as survivors. But I’m also grateful that we had the opportunity to stand together as survivors on our own two feet at Sundance.”“I was hoping to, I think, hide behind the power and the strength and the dignity and the courage of Oprah Winfrey, which I still admire and believe in,” she said, but when the film premiered despite the distribution fallout, “I discovered we are enough, and I’m so much stronger for having survived that massive gut punch,” said Dixon.The film received a standing ovation at Sundance, but the response from the music industry since has been, according to Dixon, Hines and Abrams, “crickets”. “While the outpouring of support has been great from a lot of people I’d never met before in the film world, and in the largely white entertainment film world,” said Dixon, “the people I’d known for 25 years in the black entertainment world have been largely silent, still to this day.”The people, who “continue to turn a blind eye, even in the light of 20 women coming forward about various allegations of sexual misconduct against Russell Simmons”, are, said Dixon, “the spoonful of sugar that helped Russell’s medicine go down”.The alleged assaults by Simmons, the harassment by Reid – long glossed over as just part of the business, the cost of doing your job and upholding the culture – are only the tip of the iceberg, the women said. “There’s a lot of films to be made in the music industry,” Ziering added. “I hope people start making them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6a039f5d5953b613d87539b28ad1551100d01f/0_0_7081_4248/master/7081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f59fd676737be550a0d9472da44511","title":"move over potato salad the best veg side dishes for a barbecue kitchen aide","story":"It’s not only meat that benefits from the application of direct heat – vegetables are also transformed by fire and smoke• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theI find barbecue sides uninspiring. Any tips for a good veg dish that isn’t potato salad?Dan, London E13First to get up in your grill, Dan, is live-fire cook Genevieve Taylor. But before we go any further, we must address your potato salad takedown. “Grilling potatoes on the barbecue is a really lovely thing to do,” counters Taylor, who wrote Charred: The Complete Guide to Vegetarian Grilling and Barbecue. She cuts new potatoes into wedges, grills them slowly until crisp on the outside, then adds “an Italian-style olive-oil-based dressing and basil” while they are still warm. “Pretty much every veg you can think of is boosted with a little bit of smoke and fire,” says Taylor. The beauty of cooking this way, she says, is that you can layer textures, flavours and colours in a way that you can’t with meat: “I might start with a base of root veg, such as carrots, which always benefit from a little blanch first to open up the cell walls so you can then hit them with a marinade, such as cumin, garlic and chipotle chilli. Then grill them until charred in places and nice and sticky.” Taylor layers them with herbs, spring onions, nuts and ricotta.Whole cauliflowers have become a barbecue’s best friend, but only when blanched first, then cooked slowly. “A lot of vegetables take longer to cook on the barbecue than you might imagine,” says Taylor. “My top tip is to set up your barbecue so that you have different zones of heat – only put charcoal on one side of the barbecue, so that you have the option to cook indirectly or directly over the fire.”Taylor cooks the cauliflower over an indirect heat until tender, then slides it over the fire to caramelise. Then, says Georgina Hayden, the author of Taverna, it is all about the finishing touches. She tosses her cauliflower in a mix of tahini, yoghurt, garlic, lemon and olive oil, then adds herbs andor chilli. This works well with broccoli, too.Vinegar is a useful tool to contrast that charcoal flavour, says Neil Campbell, the head chef at Rovi in London: “Try slicing white onions, mixing with apple cider vinegar, sugar and salt, then leaving to sit. Lightly grill some asparagus and green beans, then chop and toss them in the vinaigrette and throw in some basil.” Onion also makes a cracking side to meat: “Cut red onions in half (skin on), then cook face down until they are pretty much black, then slip them off the direct heat and cook skin side down so they sweat and steam.” Once they are done, Campbell removes the skin, slices the onions and adds Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper.To spice things up, look for inspiration from cultures where fire cooking is prevalent, says Taylor: “Indian tandoor cooking, Mexico or south-east Asia, for all those wonderful marinades with lemongrass, lime leaves and coriander.” And if you have some citrus fruits knocking around, toss them on to the grill, too, then squeeze over veg before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76f550937bb4bbd48a791a623ecdf1e69aaf16b6/0_2477_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373f81fa13ec2e5116704a40a77de64a","title":"nigel slater recipe for green and cheese","story":"You won’t be able to resist this warming veggie midweek dishSoftened onions, a lovingly made sauce and some grated cheese is the perfect base in which to use up any leafy, thick-stemmed greens.Pour 500ml of milk into a saucepan, add a couple of bay leaves, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, half a dozen peppercorns and half a small onion.

He has Lewandowski unmarked in the middle but overhits his cross. Dortmund got away with one there.47 min “Hello Rob,” says Woolie Madden. “What a fine day for a bit of association football. The Haaland vs Davies battle is great. The future of football represented right there - but it’s quite possible, even probable, that we won’t see either play in a World Cup.”You say that, but Norway and Canada might make it to Gianni Infantino’s 256-team tournament in 2030.46 min Peep peep! Bayern begin the second half. Dortmund have made a double change: Jadon Sancho and Emre Can replace Julian Brandt and Thomas Delaney.Yeah, the more I see it the more I think he should have saved it. But anyone who isn’t a sucker for a disguised chip from a diminutive midfield player is an enemy of life. Peep peep! Bayern are 45 minutes away from a seven-point lead - and an eighth straight championship. Joshua Kimmich’s delicious chip gave Bayern the lead at the end of an intense and intriguing first half on reflection Roman Burki might have done better, but it was a masterful bit of play from Kimmich. See you in 10 minutes to see whether Dortmund can save the 2019-20 title race.44 min I reckon if Pep Guardiola could clone one player in world football, with a view to having seven or eight of him in Manchester City’s starting XI, it would be Joshua Kimmich.That is pure class. After a long spell of Bayern pressure, Kimmich collected a loose ball 20 yards from goal, looked up and kissed a delightful chip towards goal. The backpeaddling Burki got a good touch on to the ball as he leapt desperately towards his own goal, but it was not strong enough and the ball dropped into the net.Joshua Kimmich gives Bayern the lead with a glorious goal!42 min Goretzka appeals hopefully for a penalty after being eased out of his stride by the arm of Delaney. The referee isn’t interested.41 min Kimmich’s corner from the right bounces dangerously across the area. Dortmund are starting to look a little edgy, and I fear for them if Bayern score first.40 min A right-wing cross is headed away to Goretzka, 30 yards from goal. He waits for the ball to bounce and cuts across a sweet strike that is punched away by Burki. It was close enough to the keeper for it to be a comfortable enough save.39 min Davies beats two players on the edge of the area with a charming little zig-zag. For a second it looks like he’s through, but Hummels comes across to ease him off the ball. 39 min “I expect the crowd noise is taken from the second option supplied by Sky Germany,” says Paul. “You can either watch the match and enjoy the deranged shouting of coaches, players etc., or have the background noise of a Dortmund crowd. I liked the old option better where you could tune out the commentator and have the ‘real’ stadium noise as background.”Shame you can’t do that with liveblogs really.37 min Dortmund have had a lot of success with switches of play, particularly out to Guerreiro on the left. 35 min Dahoud plays an excellent pass to find Brandt in space on the right wing. He tries to guide a first-time cross into the space behind the Bayern defence but gets too much on it. Goalkick to Bayern.34 min Lewandowski’s lovely dummy allows Coman’s pass to run through to Muller, but Piszczek comes across to make a fine interception. Despite the lack of clear chances, this is excellent stuff.33 min: Great defending from Davies!Haaland gets away from Alaba and rumbles into the area. He’s about to shoot - and almost certainly score - when Davies appears from nowhere to make a vital interception. Davies’s acceleration is frightening.32 min Another opportunity for Dortmund. Hakimi’s deep cross is headed down by Hummels towards Brandt, who can’t deal with an awkward bounce on the six-yard line. Hummels, as Owen Hargreaves points out on BT Sport, should probably have headed the ball back across goal.30 min Hazard plays a good return pass to Haaland on the left side of the area. He screws a left-footed shot that hits Davies and deflects safely across to the far side. It wasn’t a clean strike from Haaland, who looks frustrated with himself.30 min “The announcers keep talking about hearing everything the players say, yet all I hear is cheering and chanting and singing, that the players can’t hear,” says Joe Pearson. “Also, Dortmund’s passing has been surprisingly sloppy.”Yes, I thought they started excellently but have made some bad choices in the final third in the last 20 minutes or so.29 min Lewandowski is moving gingerly after a collision with Piszczek. I think he’s okay.28 min Haaland’s attempted scissor kick from the edge of the area slices off the side of his leg. Moments later, Brandt’s dipping cross from the left towards Haaland is superbly headed away by Alaba.26 min A superb tackle from Piszczek on Lewandowski allows Dortmund to break dangerously. Eventually Brandt delays on the edge of the area before finding Dahoud, who can’t decide what to do with the ball and in the end does nothing.25 min “Hi Rob,” says Shafath. “The fake crowd noise is not that bad actually. They seem to be in sync with what is going on in the match and does seem to create a match ‘atmosphere’. Much better than the hollow sound of something being played in the actual stadium.”The plot thickens. I’ll see if I can find a stream with noise for the Leverkusen game later.24 min Coman’s stinging shot from the right side of the area is beaten away by Burki. Bayern are getting closer. It was a comfortable enough save for Burki, because the angle was so tight, but it was a beautiful strike.23 min “Dear Rob,” says Nelson Kalberer. “The fake fan noises ruin the atmosphere of these games. It’s so obviously fake and just not an accurate portrayal of how the game is played and how it sounds. As someone who wrote a 4,000-word paper on the impact of fans on the pitch, simply putting noises to replicate fans does nothing to the tension of the matches. I’d much prefer to listen to the players shout at each other than fake fan sounds and TV companies should either give an option for fake atmospheres or simply stop using them.” I suspect I would agree with approximately 100 per cent of your email had I seen (and heard) one of these matches. I don’t see the point.22 min After a slow start, Bayern are starting to look dangerous.19 min: Piszczek clears off the line from Gnabry! It’s 1-1 in goalline clearances. Coman, on the right side of the area, found Gnabry with a speculative cross on the turn. He got the ball out of his feet and drove it low past Burki, but Piszczek kicked it off the line. His anticipation and positioning were immaculate. 18 min Dortmund work the ball from right to left and then back again. But then Kimmich nicks the ball with a beautifully judged interception. He’s such a class act. 17 min “Hi Rob,” says Matt Burtz. “I’ve missed the MBMs during all the pandemic and this game is a perfect ersion on a Tuesday morning here in the U.S. Personally, I don’t mind the lack of a crowd and the piped-in noise. What say you?”While I don’t think it’s sustainable, the lack of a crowd been a lot less off-putting than I expected. Maybe that’s because I’m used to watching cricket. I haven’t watched a match with an artificial atmosphere, though, and am not in a hurry to do so. 15 min A good spell of possession for Bayern, who are playing more like the home side. Coman ruins it all with an overhit pass to Muller.13 min Hummels is booked for a tactical foul on Coman.12 min Kimmich floats a glorious ball from the left that just evades the leaping Muller on the six-yard line and runs through to Burki. I think Muller might have deliberately left it, presumably in an attempt to dummy Burki. It would have been a touch of genius had it worked it didn’t.11 min Lewandowski’s cross shot from the edge of the area is comfortably saved by Burki.10 min: Hazard has a goal disallowed for offside. He knew it, in fairness, and there were no complaints. It was Hakimi who was offside in the build-up. There was a big chance just before that, when Haaland’s close-range shot was blocked by Boateng after good play from Hakimi and Hazard. Dortmund look good and have exploited the space behind Alaba and Davies three or four times already.8 min Haaland wins a corner for Dortmund on the right. It’s headed away at the near post.I think some TV companies are piping it in, though my BT Sport feed is mercifully free of such silliness.5 min Lewandowski moves into the area and drills a shot that is well blocked by the stretching Hummels. This has been a terrific start.4 min Delaney’s brilliant crossfield pass finds Guerreiro, who knocks it back from the byline towards Brandt on the left edge of the area. He moves the ball onto his right foot and whips a curler that is too close to Neuer, who makes a comfortable save. Lovely play from Dortmund though.3 min It’s been an assured start from Dortmund, with some neat, snappy passing.30 seconds: Boateng clears off the line from Haaland! Crikey, that was almost a sensational start. Neuer came out of his area to beat Hazard to Brandt’s through ball. Haaland picked up the loose ball and slid it through the legs of Neuer with his left foot, but Boateng was waiting on the line to boot it clear.1 min Peep peep! Dortmund, in yellow, kick off from left to right. Bayern are in red. It’s the El Klassiker!The players emerge on a very pleasant evening in Dortmund: 19 degrees, a clear sky and light winds, 2 per cent chance of rain. What more could we want?Dortmund have suffered some brutal defeats by Bayern in the last five years (5-0, 4-1, 6-0, 5-0, 4-0), though all of those were in Munich. This, they will hope, is different. It needs to be, for the sake of the title race.Mats Hummels is fit to start, which is a big boost for Dortmund, but there’s a blow for little Englanders with the news that Jadon Sancho is only on the bench.

From Gauntlet to Diablo, this genre has always featured dank subterranean lairs, treasure chests and warrior skeletons – all beloved Minecraft components. The signature blocky visuals also work well, ensuring that Minecraft Dungeons will look familiar to fans as they hurtle through dioramas of hack-and-slash fun that rearrange themselves each time you play.The plot is paper thin: a vengeful loner discovers a treasure that turns him into a powerful mage and duly begins a reign of terror over the Minecraft kingdom. The game can be played alone, but it is most enjoyable to play its co-op mode, which can be enjoyed on a console or online. In this mode players work together to bring down waves of skeletons, slime monsters, and giant spiders, reviving fallen allies as they go. With four players taking part, each equipped with magical weapons, the screen is soon awash with arrows, explosions, lightning bolts and freeze rays in a confusing but exciting light show. As Gauntlet veterans will recall, it’s the hidden rhythms of this genre that are really delightful the anticipation of the next wave of enemies, the anarchy of battle, then the delicious gluttony of loot collection.Fighting is highly intuitive – one button for melee attacks, one for ranged weapons. You start with a basic sword and bow, but soon unlock more powerful weapons such as spears, battle hammers and rapid-fire crossbows. You can also earn enchantments for your weapons, giving them new attacks – a poison cloud or lightning strike, for example. Armour and artefacts imbue you with their own special abilities, from lasers to healing auras. The generous cornucopia of defensive and attacking options add a rich seam of strategy and planning to the chaos of the levels.From the first encounter with a cute skeletal archer to the final mega battle against the Arch Illager himself, Minecraft Dungeons is a delightful thrill ride of a dungeon game. The levels are filled with detail, from lush pixellated woodlands to deep red stone caverns where clattering mine carts rush through the narrow tunnels and torches flicker on craggy walls. Each level has a clear path to the end, but there are plenty of side routes to explore, along with whole cast of baddies and bosses including the terrifying Endermen, accompanied by horror movie music, and necromancers who generate hordes of zombies.Minecraft Dungeons is enlivened by a sprightly, varied score, theatrical sound effects and many references to the original Minecraft. If you aren’t charmed by the baby zombies rushing at you, arms outstretched, or by the collectible anthropomorphic dungeon keys that run away in terror when you’re attacked, then you have had your soul extracted by a sorcerer.Minecraft Dungeons isn’t exactly an epic challenge. You’ll be able to complete a basic run-through in an evening, though escalating difficulty levels bring up ever more powerful and interesting weapons and items. Plus, as the levels are partly random, they’re never quite the same when you return, adding to the replay value. Some players will find it galling that the game map shows an unavailable area that will be available to purchase later on.It’s also a shame that we see none of the main game’s focus on player creativity. Between each level you’re returned to your training camp where you can buy new items and practise with fresh weapons, and it would have been a nice touch to be able to build your own little castle there. But as a retro-tinged hack-and-slash jaunt with plenty of Mojang character and humour, Minecraft Dungeons is a hugely erting treat that’ll provide hours of fun for locked-down families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c7630b22a1dcfc5f4ac89e757f547b85887ff0/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cca5e95035ec0528fe458a03789dc2e8","title":"uk behind yemen and sudan on global index of childrens rights report finds","story":"Report also warns of ‘dire impact’ of pandemic worldwide with large number of children failing to return to school after lockdowns easeThe suspension of vaccination programmes, school closures and a surge in domestic violence during coronavirus lockdowns are likely to derail a decade’s worth of progress for children, according to new global research.The Kidsrights Foundation on Tuesday published its annual rankings of children’s rights in 182 countries with Iceland scoring top for the second year running followed by Switzerland, Finland and Sweden.The UK fared poorly, ranking in 169th place behind countries including Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The country’s poor treatment of Roma and Gypsy children was criticised while the UK’s anti-terrorism strategy, Prevent, was found to have a stigmatising effect on Muslim children.British children’s views were not systematically heard in developing policy that affects them, the report found. It also highlighted concerns around lack of legal aid while many children feel they are not listened to by social workers, paid carers, judges and other professionals working in family legal proceedings.Chad has fallen behind Afghanistan to reach the bottom of the rankings while Sierra Leone has the third worst result.The advocacy group’s chairman, Marc Dullaert, told the  the pandemic would have a dire impact: “Our index shows that even before Covid-19, countries were not allocating sufficient budgets around the protection of child rights. Now we expect the economic consequences of the crisis to turn the clock back 10 years on the progress made around the wellbeing of children, unless governments take swift action.”Countries are scored using UN data and evidence collected from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. They are assessed across five areas including health, education, and enabling an environment that promotes child rights.“Overall, we see two big red flags in the findings this year,” said Dullaert. One is lack of government funding around children’s health, education and protection.The other is around the discrimination of children with more than a third of countries having the lowest possible score in this area.“We see in 91 of 182 countries that girls do not have the same rights as boys in terms of inheritance rights, access to education and equal treatment in legislation. It is not only in developing countries that there is a problem with discrimination.”Italy ranked 15th in the index, up from 74, after being commended for adopting laws on cyberbullying and protecting children with disabilities. It was criticised for smear campaigns against organisations helping migrants.The index is not an absolute ranking of countries where children have the best life but nations are scored relative to their capacity to implement children’s rights.“Once we take this into account, surprising rankings might occur,” said Professor Karin Arts, of the International Institute of Social Studies, who was among those who compiled the data.“Examples are the ultra-low scores of Australia (135), New Zealand (168) and the UK (169), and the high ranks of Thailand (8) and Tunisia (17),” she said.Australia has dropped from 19 last year to 135 because of the poor treatment of refugee and migrant children, as well as Aboriginal young people who were found to be discriminated against in ways that affected their rights to education and health.Dullaert said: “It is really sad to see that recent welfare reforms have pushed more children into poverty in a rich country like the UK. We are also concerned about children in detention who, because of the indirect impact of Covid-19, are effectively in solitary confinement and have nearly no contact with family or the outside world.”The Kidsrights Foundation said the fallout from measures taken by governments to reduce the spread of Covid-19 would have lasting effects on children globally.School closures in 188 countries affect 1.5 billion children, leaving them vulnerable to child labour, child marriage and teenage pregnancy.“Millions of children were out of school for a long period and we see especially in developing countries that, even after the easing of lockdown, there is an enormous drop-off rate, with large numbers of children failing to return to school again,” said Dullaert. “As with the Ebola crisis, this will result in more children being put into work and early marriages for girls.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

He was ill for 10 days, then recovered. He’s usually a crazily prolific songwriter – two of his band’s most celebrated albums, 50 Song Memoir and 69 Love Songs, obviously contain 119 songs between them – but he hasn’t come up with any new numbers since he got ill. The problem is that he can only write songs in bars. And not just any bar – it needs to be “one-third full of cranky old gay men gossiping over thumping disco music”. Plus he needs a glass of cognac, to be slowly sipped, and a corner with a light so he can see his notebook.Fortunately, before the outbreak, he was able to find a place that fulfilled these conditions and the result is the Magnetic Fields’ latest album. Like most of Merritt’s records, there’s a concept – on this one, titled Quickies, all the songs but one are two minutes 15 seconds or less. However, that’s not an unusual length for a Magnetic Fields tune – as Merritt points out over the phone, one-third of the songs on 69 Love Songs would qualify.Is it ingrained in him that this is the perfect length for a pop song? “It’s ingrained in everyone in Gen X or earlier,” he says. “It used to be that seven-inch singles were 2 mins 50 in length maximum – this is before Bohemian Rhapsody and such epics were considered singles.” It’s much more rare for him to write a song that lasts around five minutes. “That’s long to me, yes, both in my tastes and musical output. I like bubblegum and experimental music so I’m comfortable with two minutes and I’m comfortable with six hours.”This is a relatively loquacious answer for Merritt, whose laconic baritone has had many interviewers tearing their hair out. When I mention his long-standing interest in brevity – he co-wrote a book, 101 Two-Letter Words, with the New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast, inspired by the shortest words you can use in Scrabble – his entire answer is: “Hm.”He’s hilarious, if you don’t mind protracted awkward silences – a man of passionately held, if quietly expressed, views. Don’t get him started on bonus tracks. “I’ve always hated bonus tracks. The whole idea bugs me. Either it’s an album or it’s not an album. It gets my Asperger’s up to even think about it.” Does he really have Asperger’s? “I don’t know, I refuse to ask for a diagnosis, but my various friends with Asperger’s swear I do, yes.”As well as brevity, it’s Merritt’s way with a lyric that makes the songs on Quickies extraordinary. It’s hard to imagine anyone else writing tracks called You’ve Got a Friend in Beelzebub, I Wish I Were a Prostitute Again and The Biggest Tits in History. Merritt says that I Wish I Were a Prostitute Again is something a couple of his friends have regularly lamented. “They both harp on it a lot. I have heard a whole lot of the lyrics to this song verbatim. But clearly it’s an exaggeration of what they actually do.” (The song includes dressing up as King Tut, Betty Boop and the Turin Shroud and selling one’s “urine” and “poop”.)Then there’s the song The Day the Politicians Died, which describes global revelry breaking out in response to the event of the title. A bit extreme? “It’s a little less extreme than what I think about politicians,” Merritt counters. “It would be illegal for me to express my actual political opinions in probably any country in the world, and I definitely wouldn’t be allowed to travel.”He pauses – again – and then elaborates. “In reaction to Donald Trump’s suggestion that people ingest disinfectants, Howard Stern suggested that there should be a Trump rally in which his supporters drink disinfectants and, quote, all drop dead, unquote. I admire Howard Stern for being able to say these things and keep his job. I also completely endorse that sentiment.”Magnetic Fields fans know more about Merritt than we usually would about a musician. His previous album, 50 Song Memoir, had a lyric about each year in his life (he’s now 55) and detailed everything from his eccentric mother – who gave away all her money and joined new-age cults around the US, dragging her son with her – to the many odd illnesses he has been plagued with. The most debilitating is hyperacusis, an acute sensitivity to certain sounds, which would make it impossible for Merritt to play with an amplified rock band – Magnetic Fields gigs are much quieter affairs.Merritt believes he all but destroyed his hearing watching the industrial band Einstürzende Neubauten play a gig in New York in the early 80s. When I interviewed him 16 years ago for the cult gay magazine Butt, a publication for which he also posed naked, he told me: “I was standing too close to the circular saw being scraped across corrugated metal, and listening to the incredible sounds in my own ear of what I now realise was my hearing being damaged.”Though Quickies is mainly fiction – one song is called I Wish I Had Fangs and a Tail – Merritt’s life has still informed it. I note that there are two songs about the sinful allure of dancing (Evil Rhythm and The Price You Pay) and suggest that dancing is a theme on the record. “And all other popular music, yes,” comes the reply.Merritt takes pity on me and elaborates. “When I was young I lived against my will on a Tibetan Buddhist commune in Vermont, where music was forbidden. Music distracts you from enlightenment or something. But I was – also against my will – made to grow up in Boston for a while, which had a long history of Puritanism where all sorts of things have been banned, one of those being music, another being theatre, and I am heir to all sorts of Puritanical impulses. Also, my mother was a radical feminist acolyte of Mary Daly who I have relentlessly satirised in a number of songs, including Kill a Man a Week” – another song on Quickies. “That’s really not an exaggeration of Mary Daly’s actual opinion, it’s only a reductio ad absurdum but not actually an exaggeration.”The Magnetic Fields’ first single came out in 1991 by the late 90s Merritt’s songwriting was already revered in the music press, before 69 Love Songs, released in the US in 1999, showcased the range of Merritt’s talents to a wider public. Ranging from songs about horny puppies to sharp attempts to fathom the nature of love itself, it’s still a monumental record that is destined to overshadow the rest of Merritt’s work – which he doesn’t mind, since that was the intention. Like all his records, it ranged stylistically from folk to jangly post-punk, to Fleetwood Mac-inspired AOR and even Ace of Base-style Swedish reggae, though some genres – particularly rock – are always off-limits.Quickies, of course, is being released in the teeth of the pandemic, and Merritt is brutal about the implications for his career. “We’ve already postponed our US tour from June to January and I don’t know if January’s realistic at this point. So it may have simply ended my concert career, we don’t know.”What would happen if you couldn’t play live? “Well, I would probably have to get a job. But I would actually be relieved that I didn’t have to perform any more because I’ve never been a big fan of performing.” Like most musicians, Merritt won’t be able to get by on streams and record sales alone: “The money in the music industry is mainly in concerts at this point.”It all spells trouble for gigging musicians. “Medium-size mass gatherings will be the last thing to come back,” he predicts. “I see no reason why there can’t be big outdoor festivals, but we really really don’t do big outdoor festivals – we have a cello. Although I guess we could just have the cellist switch to bass guitar.”And then you could rock out, I joke – since if the choice was between making rock music and surviving, or staying pop and perishing, Merritt would choose the latter every time.“I don’t begin to know where to go with that,” he replies.• Quickies is out now. The vinyl version, on five seven-inch EPs, is out on 29 May, as is the CD."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

Why no, he had not ‘offered his resignation, or even thought of offering it’, because he had absolutely no idea why he should have. Over and over again he repeated: ‘I acted reasonably’.”Of Cummings’ Easter jaunt to Barnard Castle, undertaken – by his account – to check that his eyesight was up to the journey back to London, Libération remarked: “To many, driving 30 miles with blurred vision and a four-year-old in the back might not be considered entirely reasonable. But not, apparently, to Dominic Cummings.”Le Monde was equally astonished. “Usually, special advisers remain in the shadows,” it said. “At worst, when things go wrong, they quit. They never speak in public ... But for more than an hour, Cummings delivered his version of the facts, assuring all that he had ‘acted reasonably’, without breaking the rules.”There was “no question of apologising. At most, he conceded one or two minor errors … But will the operation have been successful? It will, in any case, have shown how deeply Cummings wants to keep his job. And how deeply Boris Johnson cares about this very special special adviser.”Spain’s El País said Cummings was meant to be “the breath of fresh, irreverent air that was going to help Boris Johnson design a new country after Brexit”. But the adviser’s “refusal to express any remorse for breaking the lockdown rules has caused a political gale that may irreparably damage the prime minister’s political credibility”.Johnson’s “machiavellian henchman is asking for a display of understanding and empathy that at another time, and for another person, might have seemed humane and reasonable”, the paper said.“But Cummings has left a trail of political enemies along the way, and the patience of British public opinion is at breaking point. The adviser so famously capable of scenting the mood of the people has not grasped that sometimes a resignation is not fair or unfair, but necessary to protect a superior.”In Germany, Die Welt described a “bizarre” event at which “the second most powerful man in Westminster after Boris Johnson … refused to step down or even apologise, despite massive criticism of his trip to relatives during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings could have irreparably damaged confidence in the government.”The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Cummings had “gone down in history as the first adviser to give a live press conference in Downing Street”. Usually, the paper said, “political advisers work for the government. In Cummings’ case, it is ministers who work for the adviser: one after another has been sent out to defend him.”Whether the adviser’s trip broke the rules “remains a matter of interpretation,” the paper said, but there was no denying the extent of “the outrage that has shaken the country in the past few days. Not just politicians and commentators, but academics and churchmen – all echoing the chorus of citizens demanding Cummings go.”In the Netherlands, NRC Handelsblad said Johnson was now stuck with “a growing problem. Firing Cummings, even temporarily, would remove his right hand – and Johnson’s most important ministers were appointed because of their views on Brexit, not their expert special knowledge or leadership experience.”But keeping him “is equally dangerous”, the paper said. “It will show the British public that they do not need to observe the lockdown rules so strictly. And in that case, the authority of the Johnson government will crumble yet further.”Beyond Europe, Australia’s The Age said Cummings’ press conference had “compounded his difficulties in a manner reminiscent of Prince Andrew’s catastrophic BBC interview in November”.Of the trip to Barnard Castle “to test whether his eyes were working properly”, it asked: “After setting himself up as examiner and examinee, what were other drivers on the open road to do if he failed his own assessment?”In a crisis such as the coronavirus, the paper said, “those who wield power − especially when they do so largely behind the scenes − cannot be exempted from accountability for their actions. In arguing, as Cummings has, that his is an exceptional case, he has given the impression he is beyond reproach. That is not a healthy position for anyone in a democracy to occupy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d4be0c46d4033e4154391f16866b2f1f117f06/1083_210_3636_2182/master/3636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13411bff44ae661c5e3ec4310cdae40c","title":"can coronavirus affect eyesight evidence is lacking say experts","story":"Medics including Royal College of Ophthalmologists say cases of impaired vision alongside coronavirus infection ‘rare’See all our coronavirus coverageSpeaking to the press on Monday, Dominic Cummings said he drove, with his wife and child, on a 30-mile trip to Barnard Castle during lockdown to see if he could drive safely, concerned that his eyesight might have been affected by coronavirus.In a press conference later the same day, Boris Johnson also claimed to have experienced problems with his eyesight following Covid-19, brandishing a pair of glasses and saying: “I’m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years … I think that’s very, very plausible that eyesight can be a problem associated with coronavirus.”Eye problems are not on the UK’s list of coronavirus symptoms. At present, only a high temperature, new continuous cough, and loss of taste or smell are considered common signs of the disease.A spokesperson for Moorfields eye hospital, in London, said there was, at present, very little evidence to suggest Covid-19 could affect eyesight.“Cases where Covid-19 is recorded alongside an impact on eyesight are rare, so we cannot establish a direct causal effect,” the spokesperson said.Prof Chris Hammond, Frost chair of ophthalmology at King’s College London, who is also a consultant ophthalmologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS trust, said: “Eye problems with coronavirus, Covid-19, seem to be extremely uncommon and there aren’t any reports that I can find in the literature of anyone having visual loss due to the virus.“Maybe something like one in 100 people may get a bit of conjunctivitis, which can in theory blur vision. But it is pretty uncommon.” He added that such eye problems were more frequent among patients who had been ventilated.Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the eye, and typically has symptoms including pinkness of the eye, watering and a sticky discharge.Robert MacLaren, the professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, said reports from Wuhan suggested a link between Covid-19 and conjunctivitis, as well as conjunctival hyperemia (red eye), chemosis (eye swelling), epiphora (watery eye) and increased secretions (sticky eye). MacLaren noted such symptoms could affect vision.A spokesperson for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said the college was unable to report on an association of vision impairment with Covid-19 due to the lack of evidence. But, they added, the college had previous noted coronavirus might cause conjunctivitis.Hammond said it would be clear to an inidual if they had conjunctivitis. “You would be aware that you had a bit of a pink eye and it was a bit watery and discharging. A bit like a windscreen wiper on a car, you have to blink to clear the muck off the tear film.”Hammond said a report from Brazil suggested that, from scans, some Covid-19 patients appeared to have some damage to the retina, but the patients did not have any symptoms of eye problems or loss of vision.Hammond added that severe Covid-19 might mean patients needed their reading glasses more. “It is true when you have been significantly unwell, that as all your muscles are a bit weaker, the muscles that control the focus of your eyes can be weaker,” he said. But the situation, he noted, applied only to far-sighted people, adding that Cummings appeared to wear glasses for short-sightedness – myopia – being unable to see well in the distance.As for getting behind the wheel of the car to test your eyesight, Hammond said the Highway Code stated that drivers needed to be able to read a vehicle number plate at a minimum distance of 20 metres. “When you have your driving test to see if you are seeing well enough to be allowed to drive, they test whether you can read the number plate before they allow you in the car,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb2094cbebe092dfccd2a4f012094b10aae9f72/401_221_5153_3092/master/5153.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3ee24238a396b95ef8a2c4d809b4f931","title":"spacex nasa human space launch","story":"Elon Musk’s SpaceX, in partnership with Nasa, to launch Falcon 9 rocket from Florida carrying two American astronautsIn a historic moment a decade in the making, the skies above Florida will light up on Wednesday when the launch of a rocket born from a groundbreaking public-private partnership returns the United States to the business of human spaceflight.Not since the retirement of Nasa’s space shuttle fleet in 2011 has the US possessed the capability to send its own astronauts into orbit, and the success of this week’s mission, formally known as SpaceX Demo-2, is likely to shape the direction of the space agency’s near-Earth ambitions for a generation.At 4.33pm, a Dragon crew capsule attached to a Falcon 9 rocket is set to take flight from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, bound for the international space station (ISS). It will carry two Americans as test pilots, both veterans of previous space shuttle missions. They will remain there for up to three months while mission managers evaluate the spaceship’s performance.The hardware was built by SpaceX, the private California-based company founded by the controversial billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, and funded by the US government under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP).While every previous US space program was a government venture, Nasa signaled a switch of direction in 2010 with the initiative to subcontract low Earth orbit operations to private industry while concentrating its own efforts on longer-term goals, such as returning to the moon by 2024.In a symbolic nod to the new world order, the astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will ride to the launchpad in an electric car manufactured by Tesla, another of Musk’s pioneering companies, foregoing the “tin-can” Astrovan that has been the traditional crew transport since the US began sending humans into space in 1961.“We are on the cusp of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil yet again,” said Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, who referred to Wednesday’s planned launch as “the big show”.“This time we’re doing it differently than we’ve ever done it before. Nasa is not going to purchase, own and operate the hardware the way we used to. We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, drive down our costs and increase the access to space.”According to the Planetary Society, Nasa has invested $6.2bn in CCP since 2010, making it the lowest-cost human spaceflight development effort in almost 60 years. The money has been mostly split two ways, to SpaceX and its rival Boeing, whose uncrewed test flight of the Starliner human-rated capsule ended in partial failure in December, pushing back its next launch attempts to 2021.SpaceX, which has been ferrying cargo to the ISS since 2012 under a separate freight contract with Nasa, has had to overcome challenges of its own. A Crew Dragon capsule was destroyed in a ground test explosion at Cape Canaveral in April 2019, and in 2015, a Falcon rocket carrying supplies to the ISS exploded 139 seconds into flight.“Spaceflight is not easy. They’ve had hiccups along the way and they’ve overcome them,” said Dr Henry Hertzfeld, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.“They’ve done quite well. They’ve been in existence 20 years, so not quite your startup at this point. They have a younger, more energetic workforce along with hiring some very good, experienced people, most having cut their teeth on government programs, be it Nasa or defense programs.The cancellation of the workhorse shuttle program in 2011, after 30 years of flight and punctuated by two disasters that cost 14 astronauts their lives and lost the orbiters Challenger and Columbia, marked dark days for the space industry. More than 10,000 jobs were lost, and the economy around the Florida space center tanked, despite Nasa’s continuing robotic exploratory missions to Mars and beyond.With each astronaut’s seat on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS costing the US government up to $85m, some even feared for the future of Nasa itself. In recent years the industry has become resurgent, with entrepreneurs such as Musk Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, through his Blue Origin operations and Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson fuelling a building boom at Cape Canaveral and elsewhere.Blue Origin and Virgin are pursuing the space tourism market, while expanding ambitions in other directions: for example, a team including Blue Origin was selected in April to begin development of a lander capable of returning humans to the moon under Nasa’s Artemis program, while Virgin Orbit, a Branson offshoot, was planning the first test flight of its airborne rocket launch system LauncherOne this week.Donald Trump, who has made American spaceflight a policy priority through the foundation of the Space Force as the sixth branch of the US military, and an ambitious order to Nasa to make the first crewed moon landing since 1972 within the next four years, will attend Wednesday’s launch.Coronavirus, however, has led to Nasa urging the public to watch on television from home to avoid large crowds gathering on beaches and causeways near the space center. The agency has set up a website, Launch America, to enhance the experience.“This is a moment when we can all look and be inspired,” Bridenstine said. “We have a moment in time when we don’t just have to reflect on how difficult things are right now, we can talk about how bright things are going to be in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

Today he is 74, and one of the last people in the world still using an iron lung. But after surviving one deadly outbreak, he did not expect to find himself threatened by another. By  Linda Rodriguez McRobbie The summer of 1952 was hot, even by Texas standards: 25 days above 100F (38C), the “cool” days not much cooler. But across the state, swimming pools were shut. Cinemas, too, and bars and bowling alleys. Church services were suspended. Cities doused their streets with DDT insecticide by now, health officials knew that mosquitoes didn’t spread the disease, but they had to be seen to be doing something. Nothing seemed to work. As the summer wore on, the numbers of polio cases grew.One day in July, in a quiet Dallas suburb, a six-year-old boy named Paul Alexander was playing outside in the summer rain. He didn’t feel well – his neck hurt, his head pounded. Leaving his muddy shoes in the yard, he walked barefoot into the kitchen, letting the screen door slam behind him. When his mother looked up at his feverish face, she gasped. She made him run out and grab his shoes, then ordered him to bed.Paul spent the first day in his parents’ bed, filling in Roy Rogers colouring books. But even as his fever soared and aching pains blossomed in his limbs, the family doctor advised his parents not to take him to hospital. It was clear that he had polio, but there were just too many patients there, the doctor said. Paul had a better chance of recovering at home.Over the next few days, the boy’s condition worsened. Five days after he had walked into the kitchen barefoot, Paul could no longer hold a crayon, speak, swallow or cough. His parents rushed him to Parkland hospital. Though the staff were well trained and there was a dedicated polio ward, the hospital was overwhelmed. There were sick children everywhere, and nowhere to treat them all. Paul’s mother held him in her arms and waited.When the boy was finally seen by a doctor, his mother was told that there was nothing to be done for him. Paul was left on a gurney in a hallway, barely breathing. He would have died had another doctor not decided to examine him again. This second doctor picked him up, ran with him to the operating theatre and performed an emergency tracheotomy to suction out the congestion in his lungs that his paralysed body couldn’t shift.Three days later, Paul woke up. His body was encased in a machine that wheezed and sighed. He couldn’t move. He couldn’t speak. He couldn’t cough. He couldn’t see through the fogged windows of the steam tent – a vinyl hood that kept the air around his head moist and the mucus in his lungs loose. He thought he was dead.When the tent was eventually removed, all he could see were the heads of other children, their bodies encased in metal canisters, nurses in starched white uniforms and caps floating between them. “As far as you can see, rows and rows of iron lungs. Full of children,” he recalled recently.The next 18 months were torture. Although he couldn’t talk because of the tracheotomy, he could hear the cries of other children in pain. He lay for hours in his own waste because he couldn’t tell the staff he needed to be cleaned. He nearly drowned in his own mucus. His parents visited almost every day, but his existence was unrelentingly boring. He and the other children tried to communicate, making faces at each other, but, Paul said: “Every time I’d make a friend, they’d die.”Paul recovered from the initial infection, but polio left him almost completely paralysed from the neck down. What his diaphragm could no longer do for him, the iron lung did. Paul lay flat on his back, his head resting on a pillow and his body encased in the metal cylinder from the neck down. Air was sucked out of the cylinder by a set of leather bellows powered by a motor the negative pressure created by the vacuum forced his lungs to expand. When the air was pumped back in, the change in pressure gently deflated his lungs. This was the regular hiss and sigh that kept Paul alive. He could not leave the lung. When medical staff opened it to wash him or manage his bodily functions, he had to hold his breath.What Paul remembers most vividly about the ward is hearing the doctors talk about him when they walked through on their rounds. “He’s going to die today,” they said. “He shouldn’t be alive.” It made him furious. It made him want to live.In 1954, when Paul was eight, his mother got a call from a physical therapist who worked with the March of Dimes, a US charity dedicated to eradicating polio. Paul’s months on the polio ward had left him with a fear of doctors and nurses, but his mother reassured him, and so the therapist, Mrs Sullivan, began visiting twice a week.Paul told the therapist about the times he had been forced by doctors to try to breathe without the lung, how he had turned blue and passed out. He also told her about the time he had gulped and “swallowed” some air, almost like breathing. The technique had a technical name, “glossopharyngeal breathing”. You trap air in your mouth and throat cavity by flattening the tongue and opening the throat, as if you’re saying “ahh” for the doctor. With your mouth closed, the throat muscle pushes the air down past the vocal cords and into the lungs. Paul called it “frog-breathing”.Sullivan made a deal with her patient. If he could frog-breathe without the iron lung for three minutes, she’d give him a puppy. It took Paul a year to learn to do it, but he got his puppy he called her Ginger. And though he had to think about every breath, he got better at it. Once he could breathe reliably for long enough, he could get out of the lung for short periods of time, first out on the porch, and then into the yard.Although he still needed to sleep in the iron lung every night – he couldn’t breathe when he was unconscious – Paul didn’t stop at the yard. At 21, he became the first person to graduate from a Dallas high school without physically attending a class. He got into Southern Methodist University in Dallas, after repeated rejections by the university administration, then into law school at the University of Texas at Austin. For decades, Paul was a lawyer in Dallas and Fort Worth, representing clients in court in a three-piece suit and a modified wheelchair that held his paralysed body upright.At a time when disabled people were less often seen in public – the Americans With Disabilities Act, which banned discrimination, wouldn’t be passed until 1990 – Paul was visible. Over the course of his life, he has been on planes and to strip clubs, seen the ocean, prayed in church, fallen in love, lived alone and staged a sit-in for disability rights. He is charming, friendly, talkative, quick to anger and quick to make a joke.At 74, he is once again confined to the lung full-time. Only one other person in the US still uses one. The last person to use an iron lung in the UK died in December 2017, at the age of 75. No one expected someone who needed an iron lung to live this long. And after surviving one deadly epidemic, Paul did not expect to find himself threatened by another.Poliomyelitis kills by suffocation – not by damaging the lungs, as Covid-19 does, but by attacking motor neurons in the spinal cord, weakening or severing communication between the central nervous system and the muscles. The ensuing paralysis means that the muscles that make it possible to breathe no longer work.Polio existed in isolated outbreaks around the world for millennia, but it didn’t become epidemic until the 20th century – helped, ironically, by improvements in sanitation. Poliovirus enters the body through the mouth, via food or water, or unwashed hands, contaminated with infected faecal matter. Until the 19th century, almost all children would have come in contact with poliovirus before the age of one, while they still enjoyed protection from maternal antibodies transferred from mother to baby during pregnancy. However, as sanitation improved, children were less likely to come into contact with poliovirus as babies when they encountered it as older children, their immune systems were unprepared.In the US, from 1916 onwards, each summer brought an epidemic of polio in some part of the nation. At its peak in the 40s and 50s, the virus was responsible for more than 15,000 cases of paralysis in the US each year. During this same period, it killed or paralysed at least 600,000 people annually worldwide. The year Paul contracted the virus, 1952, saw the largest single outbreak of polio in US history: almost 58,000 cases across the nation. Of those, more than 21,000 people – mostly children – were left with varying degrees of disability, and 3,145 died.Though polio was not the most lethal of epidemic diseases, it transformed everywhere it touched. “It was like the plague, it drove everybody mad,” Paul told me when I first spoke to him last year. In places where outbreaks occurred, families sheltered in fear at home with the windows shut. All kinds of public gathering places closed. Human interactions were laced with uncertainty. According to the historian David Oshinsky, some people refused to talk on the phone out of concern that the virus could be transmitted down the line. During the first major outbreak in New York in 1916, 72,000 cats and 8,000 dogs were killed in one month after a rumour went around that animals transmitted the disease (they don’t). By the 40s, parents had their children perform “polio tests” every day during the summer – touch their toes, tuck their chin to their chests, checking for pain or weakness – while insurance companies sold “polio insurance” to parents of new babies.If we had forgotten the terror of epidemics, we are now being forcibly reminded. The last time I spoke to Paul, in April, it was over Skype, from our respective lockdowns – him in his iron lung in an apartment in Dallas, with a rotating staff of full-time carers and an Amazon Echo next to his head, and me in my house in Surrey, England.Like polio, Covid-19 can be transmitted by silent carriers who don’t know they have it. Like polio, it has put normal life on hold. And just as with polio, we are pinning our hopes on a vaccine. There is even talk of bringing back the iron lung – a UK-based initiative is trying to bring a new negative-pressure ventilator called Exovent to hospitals for Covid-19 patients. Unlike positive-pressure ventilators, this smaller iron lung would fit over the patient’s chest, allowing them to remain conscious, speak, eat and take medication orally as a machine breathes for them.“It’s exactly the way it was, it’s almost freaky to me,” Paul said of the parallels between polio and Covid-19. “It scares me.”Though this virus, if he gets it, will likely kill him, life hasn’t changed dramatically for Paul since the start of the pandemic. He hasn’t been able to venture outside of his lung for more than five minutes in years. As one of his friends told me: “It’s not a strain for him, it’s his life. This is Mr Shelter-in-Place.” I asked Paul if he is worried about Covid-19. “Sure, sure,” he said. Then he added: “Well – I don’t sit around and worry about it. I’m dying a lot. It doesn’t make any difference.”Paul’s health has always been precarious, but it has declined in the past few years. When I first met him in May 2019, he was a long-term inpatient at Clements Hospital in north Dallas. More than four months earlier, he had developed a persistent respiratory infection, which had sent him to hospital. He also suffers pain in his legs every time he is moved. He had hoped the doctors could help him manage that pain, but, he told me, “It’s not about to go away,” looking up from a pillow on a wide board attached to one end of the lung. His voice is slow, raspy and sometimes punctuated by gasps. Hearing Paul over the machine’s constant sighs requires the listener to focus on him and tune out the lung accordingly, he is used to being listened to.Next to Paul’s head was a clear plastic stick, flat and about a foot long, with a pen attached to the end of it. His father crafted a stick like this when Paul was a child, and he has been using versions of it since. He clamps the end of the stick in his mouth and manipulates the pen to write, type and push buttons on the phone he used it to sign the hospital’s waiver allowing him to talk to me, although he bristled at having to sign anything at all to tell me his own story. “That is the most ridiculous thing,” he grumbled. Paul’s teeth are flattened and worn from years of using the stick. Though his body inside the lung is scarcely larger than it was when he was a child and his muscles atrophied, his neck measures 18 inches around and his jaw muscles bulge.Paul’s iron lung – his faithful “old iron horse” as he calls it – is the butter-yellow colour of 50s kitchen appliances. Its metal legs, ending in black rubber wheels, raise it to a height that suits a caregiver, while windows at the top allow them to see inside, and four portholes on the sides let them reach in. To open the machine, which weighs almost 300kg, carers must release the seals at the head and slide the user out on the interior bed. The portholes, the pressure valves, the cylindrical shape and the colour all give the impression of a sturdy miniature submarine.Iron lungs were built to last, even if no one thought the people in them would. The device was invented in 1928 by Philip Drinker, a medical engineer, and Louis Shaw, a physiologist, at Harvard. Drinker had visited Boston Children’s Hospital to investigate a malfunctioning air conditioner in the ward for premature babies, but he came away haunted what he saw in the polio ward – “the small blue faces, the terrible gasping for air”, as his sister and biographer, Catherine Drinker Bowen, later wrote. His invention was a simple mechanism, doing the job of depleted muscles, and it meant that thousands of children who would have died didn’t. The iron lung was intended to be used for two weeks at most, to give the body a chance to recover.Over time, the claustrophobic iron lung became emblematic of the devastating effects of polio. Only the sickest patients ended up in one if they made it out, a lifetime of disability was likely to follow. But once the vaccine was administered to children across the US from 1955, incidence of the disease plummeted. Those who needed short-term breathing assistance were treated by more invasive but much smaller positive-pressure ventilators, invented in 1952 by an anaesthetist during a polio outbreak in Copenhagen. These push air directly into and out of the lungs either through the mouth, via a tube that is snaked down the throat while the patient is sedated, or through a hole made in the trachea. These, like the iron lung, were only intended for short-term use those few people who needed help breathing for the rest of their lives saw a hole in their throat as an acceptable price to pay for the increased mobility that positive pressure offered. The last iron lungs were manufactured in the late 60s.By the time positive-pressure ventilators were in widespread use, however, Paul was used to living in his lung, and he had already learned to breathe part of the time without it. He also never wanted a hole in his throat again. So he kept his iron lung.With the decline of the disease, and the visual reminders of it hidden away in a handful of homes and care facilities, across much of the western world the terror of polio faded from collective memory. “You can’t believe how many people walked into my law office,” Paul said, “and saw my iron lung and said: ‘What is that?’ And I’d tell them: ‘It’s an iron lung.’ ‘What does it do?’ ‘Breathe for me.’ ‘Why?’ ‘I got polio when I was little.’ ‘What’s polio?’ Uh oh.” David Oshinsky, the author of Polio: An American Story, believes that the success of vaccines in eradicating so many deadly diseases is precisely why the anti-vaxx movement has gained ground in recent years. “These vaccines have done away with the evidence of how frightening these diseases were,” he told me.When I visited him at Clements Hospital, Paul seemed like a kind of medical celebrity – none of the hospital staff had ever seen an iron lung before. As we talked, two women in nurses’ scrubs came in. They were from another unit, but they just wanted to meet the man in the iron lung, they said. Paul told them that he was in the middle of an interview. “That’s all right, sir,” the older nurse said, “we’ll just listen for a bit.” After they left, Paul told me this happens all the time. “That’s the way it is – like living in a zoo,” he said.People often come away from meeting Paul humbled. Norman Brown, a retired nurse who has been good friends with Paul since 1971, said: “The guy is such an impressive character … most people are in awe when they first meet him.” Paul doesn’t mind answering people’s questions: “I’m a lawyer, I’m paid to talk!” He likes talking about polio and the lung, and about his life, because what terrifies him, even more than the possibility of Covid-19, is that the world will forget what polio was like, and what he achieved in spite of it.On Christmas Eve 1953, a year and a half after Paul was admitted to Parkland Hospital, his parents rented a portable generator and a truck to bring him and his iron lung home. It was a short, nerve-racking drive: “Any minute it looked like that old generator would go off,” his father Gus later told a Texas newspaper. “It kept popping. I didn’t know if we would make it home or not.” Part of the reason Paul was cleared to leave the hospital was that no one expected him to live much longer.But Paul didn’t die. He gained weight the day he got home, his older brother made him a plate of bacon – the best he’d ever tasted, he said. His parents slept in the same ground-floor living room with him, always half-awake in case the swish-swish of the machine stopped. It did during power cuts – even today, Texan storms and tornadoes sometimes knock down power lines – and his parents had to pump the machine by hand, calling neighbours in to help.After three years, Paul could leave his lung for a few hours at a time. His frog-breathing had become muscle memory – like riding a bicycle, he told me. His education had been left to founder during his 18 months on the ward. One day, his mother walked in with a pile of books borrowed from the local elementary school: she was going to teach him to read.“I had all these ambitions. I was going to be president,” he said. But it took his parents, along with the parents of several other disabled children, more than a year to convince the Dallas school system to allow him to take classes from home. In 1959, when he was 13, Paul was one of the first students to enrol in the district’s new programme for children at home. “I knew if I was going to do anything with my life, it was going to have to be a mental thing. I wasn’t going to be a basketball player,” he told me.Most days, he would leave the lung around the time other children got out of school, and sit out front in his wheelchair. Friends would push him around the streets later, as they got older, the same friends took him to diners and cinemas, then restaurants and bars.And he went to church. The Pentecostal church, to which the Alexanders belong, is a denomination characterised by a personal, passionate experience of God. At the end of each service, congregants are invited to come to the front of the church and pray. “My dad would take me down there sometimes to pray with him, and he would let all of his emotions out then,” Paul’s younger brother, Phil, told me. “He’d just cry and cry.”Paul dealt with his emotions in a different way. Polio had robbed him of his independence. “He let his anger out a lot. He had a mouth,” Phil recalled. “I completely understand it. He would yell and scream and curse and get it all out, and my parents would just let it happen, because obviously, Paul would need a release … he was normal.” It hurts Paul to think about it now. “There were frustrating times, times I’d get really mad, scream. But Mom and Dad were so tolerant, they seemed to just understand,” he said. As he spoke, tears trickled down his temple to the pillow.In 1967, Paul, now 21, graduated from high school with almost straight As. His one B was in biology, because he was unable to dissect a rat. “I was so mad,” he said. (He still is.) He applied to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, but despite his academic record, he was rejected. “I was too crippled,” he said bitterly. “Broke my heart. I fought for two years, repeatedly called them. “‘Well, wait a minute,’ I’d say, ‘I want you to reconsider, think about this. I’m coming over, I want to talk to you!’” His high school teachers backed him. Eventually, the dean of admissions relented, on two conditions: that he find someone to help him get to his classes, and that he get the polio vaccine.Paul was “scared to death” rolling into his first class. “You have to understand, back then, there were no cripples. There was none on campus, I was the only one. Wherever I went, I was the only one. Restaurant, movie theatre – I thought: ‘Wow, there’s nobody else out here. I’ll just pave the way,’” he said. “I kind of thought of myself as representing a group. I fought for that reason. ‘What do you mean I can’t go back there? I want to go back there!’ … ‘You can’t do that.’ ‘Oh yes I can!’ I was always fighting.”Paul met a woman, Claire, and fell in love. They got engaged. But one day when he called, her mother – who had long objected to the relationship – answered, refused to let him talk to her, and told him never to speak to her daughter again. “Took years to heal from that,” he said. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin. At Southern Methodist University, he’d been living at home, but now he was on his own. His parents were terrified.At UT, the caregiver Paul had hired never turned up, so for a month, the guys in his dorm took care of him – even “the most intimate things”, he said – until he was able to hire a new one. Paul graduated in 1978, and later began studying for a postgraduate degree in law. He again made headlines in November 1980: “Iron-willed man leaves iron lung to vote”, declared an article in the Austin American Statesman newspaper. Paul struggled with trying to pay for a full-time carer and his education at the same time, but in 1984, he graduated from the University of Austin with a degree in law, and found a job teaching legal terminology to court stenographers at an Austin trade school. When a newspaper reporter asked if his students found it uncomfortable to be in his class, he responded: “I don’t allow people to feel uncomfortable for very long.”He passed his bar exams, and on 19 May 1986, he slightly raised his right thumb as he took the oath promising to conduct himself with integrity as a lawyer in front of the chief justice of the supreme court of Texas. He was 40 years old, wearing a natty three-piece suit, living on his own, and able to spend most of his day outside the machine that still kept him alive.The story of how Paul taught himself to breathe is central to how he thinks about himself. It represents the determination that made everything else – getting into university, the law degree, the life of relative independence – possible. It even inspired the title of the memoir, Three Minutes for a Dog, that he self-published in April. It took him more than eight years to write it, using the plastic stick and a pen to tap out his story on the keyboard, or dictating the words to his friend, former nurse Norman Brown.But the title of the book was Kathy Gaines’s idea. Kathy, 62, has been Alexander’s caregiver since he graduated from law school and moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, although neither can remember precisely when she found his advert in the paper and became his “arms and legs”.Kathy is a type-1 diabetic and, as a consequence of the disease, has been legally blind for years, so she can’t drive. During Paul’s five-month stay in hospital last year, she took the bus or got a lift there every day. She taught the nursing staff how to manage the machine and, to some degree, Paul. While we talked, Kathy brought us foam cups of hospital coffee, and a plastic bendy straw for Paul. She left it close enough for him to reach with his tongue and mouth, but not so close as to be in the way. Kathy knows how to shave Paul’s face, change his clothes and sheets, trim his hair and his nails, hand him his toothbrush, do his paperwork, make his appointments, do his grocery shopping, and that when he says “biscuit” he usually means “English muffin”. Sometimes, if she sees his head in a position that she thinks will be uncomfortable for him, she’ll move it without asking. (He doesn’t always appreciate that.)Kathy knows everything about him, Paul says. “Kathy and I grew together … she stretched herself over as many things as I needed,” he said. For most of their relationship, Kathy has either lived with Paul or nearly next door. They’ve moved a lot: his legal career was not lucrative, and he has struggled financially. Today, Kathy lives upstairs in their communal apartment building. She sees him every day, whether she’s working or not.Though Kathy and Paul have never been romantically involved, his brother Phil describes their relationship like a marriage. “Paul has always been aggressive about things that he wants and needs around other people,” he said. “He’s pretty demanding. But Kathy is more demanding than he is. They’ve had their moments, but they always work it out.”What Paul hates is being invisible. He remembers going to restaurants where the server asked his companion, “What will he be having?” His voice shook with anger at the memory. “I think it’s why I fight so hard, because there’s people standing there with the gall to tell me what I’m going to do with my life … You have no right to tell me what to do,” he said. “You should get down on your knees and thank God it wasn’t you.”Paul has now outlived both his parents and his older brother, Nick. He has outlived his old friends. He has even outlived his original iron lung. In 2015, the seals were failing and it was leaking air. Not surprisingly, spare parts for iron lungs, and mechanics who know what they’re looking at, are difficult to find, but after a friend posted a video of Paul on YouTube asking for help, a local Dallas engineer fixed him up with a refurbished one.Paul still has big plans – he has hopes that his memoir is “going to smack across the world” – but Covid-19 is a new danger. Paul is, Phil said, “probably the most vulnerable you can get” to a virus like this one. “He’s staying positive, but we’ve also had conversations that this is probably going to do it. It’s very likely.”Paul has always thought that polio, the “demon” that tried to destroy him, was going to come back. “I can see hospitals inundated by polio victims again, an epidemic, I can see it so easily. I tell the doctors, it’s going to happen. They don’t believe me,” he told me when he was in hospital last year.It is only thanks to concerted vaccination efforts that there hasn’t been a new case of polio in the US since 1979, or in the UK since 1984. By 2000, the World Health Organization had declared all of the Americas and the western Pacific region polio-free. India, which had seen 200,000 cases of polio a year through the 1990s, was declared polio-free in 2014 after a series of aggressive vaccination campaigns. The virus is now only endemic to three countries in the world – Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan – and cases of polio number in the dozens.But Paul was right that most people have largely forgotten about the terror of polio, just as we have forgotten the terror of other diseases we now routinely vaccinate against – diphtheria, typhus, measles and mumps.

This is especially concerning as we move into an economic downtown,” Olchawski said.“The increase in self-harm among young women is deeply worrying. Yet the discussion around this issue and women and girls’ mental health is often very narrow, focusing on issues like social media rather than reflecting on wider causes. This research highlights the important relationship between self-harm and poverty.”Agenda is an alliance of groups working to help young women and girls affected by abuse, poverty, poor mental health, addiction, homelessness and criminal justice issues.NatCen, which based its findings on face-to-face interviews with more than 20,000 people in England, also found other stark differentials in mental health related to young women’s financial circumstances.Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s Budget Group, said: “This powerful report shows the strong links between poverty, mental health and self-harming for younger women. We know that young women are particularly likely to have been hit badly by the economic impact of Covid-19, since they are more likely to work in sectors like hospitality and retail that have been closed down.”Men, especially middle-aged men, are more likely to kill themselves than women. However, the suicide rate among girls and young women aged between 10 and 24 has risen: in 2018 it was the highest on record.Sally McManus, who led the research for NatCen, said: “People have become increasingly likely to report using non-suicidal self-harm as a way of coping and this increase is particularly apparent in young women. This report indicates that self-harm often occurs in the context of poverty and debt, especially for young women.”Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: “This survey underlines that economic and social inequalities have a major impact on our mental health. Young women’s mental health has deteriorated significantly in the last decade, and those who are most disadvantaged are at a far greater risk still.“The impact of Covid-19 on young women’s mental health is likely to add extra pressure both now and in the coming months and years. It’s vital that we take action now to protect mental health for all and reduce the inequalities that lie behind so much of the distress this survey has brought to light.”A government spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to supporting everyone’s mental wellbeing, especially during this unprecedented period. Vulnerable young women can continue to access mental health services, including virtually, and we have released new tailored guidance to help people deal with this outbreak through practical tips and advice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82e0dcd716897bf7e032ab6dbf1edf132f1cbbd8/346_31_2231_1339/master/2231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd246a7b57cdb79c515453821166620c","title":"ascot postpones shergar cup horse racing","story":"This year’s Shergar Cup, the competition involving jockeys representing regions of the world along with an international women’s team, has had to be cancelled.The Ascot event, scheduled for its usual early-August slot, was perhaps the race day most vulnerable to the coronavirus crisis, since it requires the presence of jockeys drawn from all around the world performing in front of a family-based crowd of up to 30,000.Nick Smith, Ascot’s director of racing, said: “Regrettably, given the complexities of flying jockeys around the world and uncertainty over what governmental regulations will be in place at the time, the Shergar Cup won’t take place this year.”Guy Henderson, Ascot’s chief executive, added: “We decided that this event, even if logistically possible, wouldn’t be the same without crowds and that the best option was to plan ahead to return with the event in 2021.”Ascot will work with the British Horseracing Authority to devise a replacement programme of races for the day.The event would have featured the return to Ascot of Emma-Jayne Wilson, the swaggering Canadian rider whose cheerful volubility made her a crowd favourite and a staple at the event for several years until her most recent appearance in 2017. Hayley Turner was also expected to take part, a year after finally winning the Silver Saddle for top rider at the meeting, which she described as “a massive thrill”.While Ascot hope to press ahead with the Royal meeting behind closed doors next month, the Shergar Cup would be much less likely to succeed in such a format, even if an appropriate collection of jockeys could be assembled.Its appeal is mainly to those present in the grandstands purist followers of the sport have not warmed to it in great numbers, while its programme of 10-runner handicaps featuring unfamiliar riders means it is of only limited appeal to punters.“I’m absolutely gutted,” Turner said. “I understand why it has to be this way but the Shergar Cup is always the highlight of the year for me. It’s good fun and it’s nice to get together with the international riders. But we can’t grumble, can we? There’s a lot worse things going on.”Meanwhile, Andrew Balding has enthused about the Qipco 2,000 Guineas prospects of Kameko, fourth in the betting for the Classic a week on Saturday. Balding sent his stable star, a Group One winner when last seen in November, to Kempton for a gallop last week and liked what he saw.As a caveat, the jockey expressed his admiration for the Guineas favourite, Pinatubo, whose unbeaten juvenile season made him the best two-year-old in Europe for 25 years. “I think he deserved his rating last year, he beat everything impressively. I thought the day at the Curragh was just incredible and the clock backed it up as well. So we have massive respect for him. You just hope one horse has improved more than the other from two years to three.”Balding added that soft ground would be a concern for Kameko but weeks of dry weather in Newmarket makes that seem a remote possibility for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baebb08b06513e829be2aa37a4aa36eddab7d0a1/0_30_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c8552fb4034f613549af3b28cc0be7f","title":"michael jordan isiah thomas dream team olympics last dance nba","story":"Michael Jordan’s claim that he had no part in his rival Isiah Thomas being left off the USA’s Olympic ‘Dream Team’ have been contradicted by a new audio recording.In the recent ESPN documentary on Jordan’s career, The Last Dance, the six-time NBA champion denied he had lobbied for Thomas to be omitted from the Dream Team, which went on to win gold at the 1992 Olympics.But on his podcast, The Dream Team Tapes, writer Jack McCallum played an interview from 2011 which contradicted Jordan’s claim.Jordan and Thomas shared an intense rivalry during their careers. In The Last Dance Jordan admitted he still had “hate” for Thomas, stemming from an incident when the Detroit Pistons refused to shake hands with the Bulls after Chicago’s victory in the 1991 Eastern Conference finals.However, in The Last Dance, Jordan denied he had asked Thomas to be left off the team. McCallum wrote a book, The Dream Team, on the 1992 Olympics in which he says Jordan’s opposition to Thomas was crucial to the guard being omitted. “Please, in the year of our Lord 1991, there was no one who was going to pick Isiah Thomas over Michael Jordan. It’s that simple,” McCallum said on his podcast.While The Last Dance has been wildly popular, it has also been met with some criticism. Many critics have noted than Jordan’s production company was involved in making the show, and many of the Hall of Famer’s faults were glossed over as a result.Jordan’s former Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen is said to be “livid” with the way he is portrayed in the documentary, while another teammate, Horace Grant, was even more blunt. “When that so-called documentary is about one person, basically, and he has the last word on what’s going to be put out there ... it’s not a documentary,” Grant said. “It’s his narrative of what happens in the last, quote-unquote dance. That’s not a documentary because a whole bunch of things was cut out, edited out. So that’s why I call it a so-called documentary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f05e61218de2ef8f312da6ec48883d97f3d3e0f2/0_296_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d640f2d9373a7e57f57d412490f9ff5","title":"tyrrells end sponsorship womens premier 15s rfu","story":"The Rugby Football Union has refused to rule out funding cuts for top-flight women’s clubs after it was announced that Tyrrells will be ending its sponsorship of the Premier 15s league in August.The RFU is hopeful of securing another title partner, insisting it remains “an attractive proposition”, but warned there would be no guarantees for the 10 clubs, with the union forecasting losses of up to £122m because of the coronavirus pandemic if the men’s autumn internationals do not go ahead.When Tyrrells became the title sponsor for the Premier 15s in 2017, the RFU pledged investment of £2.4m into the league over the next three years, which equates to £80,000 a season for each club. This season’s Premier 15s competition was declared null and void in March and the RFU said it was unable to offer assurances over the same level of financing in the future.“The RFU has been very clear on the financial impact of Covid-19 if autumn internationals don’t go ahead,” a spokesperson said. “The women’s game and Premier 15s remain key priorities however, like all businesses, until we have clarity on absolute revenues, we can’t provide absolute guarantees on any future funding.“The women’s game is crucial to the health of the overall game and we are proud of the role we will continue to play in investing and growing participation by ensuring the women’s game is not hit disproportionally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee80b4e38712d180ff80fed2433e8287173af92c/0_458_3896_2336/master/3896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9e4eea3790f945982b15e2bcc8c401","title":"one giant leap meet the new generation of male royal ballet stars","story":"Beauty, strength and bags of energy: BBC Four’s Men at the Barre documentary gets up close and personal with the Royal Ballet dancers on the rise‘It’s a golden era of male ballet dancers.” So says Emma Cahusac, the commissioning editor behind a new documentary, Men at the Barre, part of BBC Four’s dance season. It’s not just hyperbole. The young men rising up at the Royal Ballet are some of the most exciting in dance right now: principals Matthew Ball and Marcelino Sambé, first soloists Cesar Corrales and William Bracewell, and first artist Joseph Sissens all feature in Men at the Barre. With the majority of them British or UK-trained, it’s a giant leap from the grumblings of a decade ago about the lack of local dancers making it to the top.I spoke to Ball, Corrales and Sambé by phone, all staying resolutely positive during this enforced break from their intensive dancing lives, but all desperate to get back to work with colleagues they’re certain are something special. “I see so much beauty and so much strength and power in that company,” says Sambé. “There has been a surge in this younger generation,” says Ball.Why this wealth of talent has arrived right now isn’t easy to pinpoint, but they definitely spur each other on. There’s healthy competition – ballet boys can’t resist a pirouette-off Corrales’ record is “at least 15” – but they all talk about how secure they feel because each dancer is very different.Liverpool-born Ball, 26, who trained at the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11, is the tall athlete-poet with a flair for drama. He took leave from the Royal Ballet to make a dazzlingly seductive turn in Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake and his interests lie in character and storytelling. “He’s almost dancing with his brain,” says Sambé. “There’s always something so intense going on he’s bubbling, bubbling, bubbling.”Ball and Sambé have been friends since the latter joined the Royal Ballet Upper School at 16. “Marcelino is so full of energy and vivacity and life,” says Ball. “That’s his personality and his dancing matches that. When you see him move it’s like a fish to water, it just makes sense.” Sambé’s joy as he springs and bounds has made him an outright audience favourite, although he admits his beaming smile was originally a mechanism for coping with nerves. “The one thing that made me feel comfortable was a big smile, to connect with the audience,” he says.Corrales, at 23, is the virtuoso prodigy. The son of Cuban ballet dancers, raised in Canada, he joined English National Ballet aged 17, was a principal at 20 and moved to the Royal two years ago. “He’s a real firecracker,” says Ball. “He certainly pushes us to achieve one more centimetre higher or an extra turn. People often talk about British dancers being controlled or mannered and that’s something I personally don’t want to buy into.”A notable line in Men at the Barre comes from ballet master Christopher Carr, who was a dancer in the Royal Ballet in the era of Rudolf Nureyev. He says that if Nureyev was around now, he wouldn’t be such a big star: “There are now better dancers.” Corrales takes issue with that. “Nureyev was on another planet!” he says. But it’s true that while Nureyev was ahead of his time, and had blazing power and charisma, there are technically better dancers with every generation. The expectations on young dancers now are much greater than their predecessors. Everything is bigger, faster, higher training draws on hi-tech sports science, and they must master not only the exactitudes of classical technique, but be versatile enough to perform the most contortive contemporary moves. They don’t just follow directions, either, but help develop movement with choreographers. “It’s very different to other generations,” says Corrales. “You need to have that skill of contributing, bringing ideas to the table.”With two ballet dancers for parents, Corrales had the genes and the set-up for a smooth career path. In Cuba dancers are revered, with footballer-like status, but growing up in Canada he experienced bullying, “especially since I was the smallest in the class,” he says. He could laugh, because “they just had no clue” about dance, but at the same time he thinks that spurred him on to literally jump higher. “All those negative comments, the bullying in school from a young age, gave me that power and explosiveness to become who I am today.”The teasing Corrales experienced probably chimes with most people’s expectations about the lingering stigma attached to boys who do ballet – mocking comments made by US television presenter Lara Spencer about Prince George doing ballet feature in Men at the Barre. But it’s not everyone’s experience. Ball, whose mother is a dance teacher, remembers “leaving school halfway through the day to go and audition in London and all the lads giving me high fives and wishing me good luck. I was actually quite supported, which some people might be surprised by, especially in Liverpool which is such a football city.”Unlike Ball and Corrales, Sambé doesn’t come from a dancing background. From a poor family in Lisbon, his construction-worker father died when he was eight and he was fostered by another family with a daughter at the Lisbon Conservatory, where Sambé studied. His earliest dance experience was in African dance and he first saw ballet on YouTube. He wouldn’t have found his calling without it, he says, especially seeing black dancers such as Carlos Acosta. “An incredible moment, thinking, yeah, of course you can do this.”The internet has inevitably had a huge impact on this generation of dancers, and on the reach of an art form previously confined to the stage. Having a social media profile is part of the job for dancers now, and the combination of gorgeous bodies and photogenic grit and strength has turned out to be catnip for brands looking for ambassadors and influencers. The dancers’ Instagram accounts reveal superhuman tricks and off-stage candour (Sambé has an account dedicated to his beautiful backstage shots of colleagues). You can check out how they’ve all been spending lockdown: Corrales and principal dancer girlfriend Francesca Hayward giddily laughing their way through multiple pirouettes Ball and his partner, fellow dancer Mayara Magri, filming their plyometric fitness routine in the park. When we speak, Ball has just taken delivery of a shoulder rig for his camera, using the time off to explore his other creative interests – he thinks there’s a lot of potential to better capture dance on film.Sambé has been painting and gardening, he tells me, and working on his own choreography, some of which can be seen in a film made (pre-lockdown) with Cloakroom magazine, all undulating muscles and sharp turns. It’s a hint of what’s to come, the choreography connecting to Sambé’s first experience in African dance, a meshing of dance identities he wants to pursue. “To be able to explore incredible ballet dancers’ bodies doing this kind of movement I think will be really cool.”Ballet can be so much more than its traditional image, insists Sambé, but it means this generation breaking out of the ballet bubble. “I believe the art form is still in its infancy,” he says, “and there’s so much more to explore. We need to look out at what is happening in the world, from politics to arts, and bring that into the ballet world.” More than ever, young dancers aren’t just empty vessels, he says. “There are so many layers to being an artist this way. The process is so rich and intense and visceral. The sacrifice brings such a specific grain and incredible strength. I feel there’s a misconception that we all just go on stage and look pretty, but no, there’s so much more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68899ccaa99451d4b4c876e6cd45724952cae551/0_148_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b92d79ff6cdfbc6f77d9072c25dfec9","title":"swan lake bath ballet bbc corey baker lockdown bathtub","story":"BBC commissions choreographer Corey Baker’s splashy new lockdown-friendly take on the classic balletIt has been performed by ballet companies in the grandest of opera houses around the world. Now a new take on Swan Lake, commissioned by the BBC, is to be performed in the confines of dancers’ own bathtubs.Swan Lake Bath Ballet, set to Tchaikovsky’s music, has been choreographed by Corey Baker who says the idea came to him, appropriately enough, in the shower. Baker wanted to create a piece uniting dancers who are in lockdown and he asked himself what they might all have in their home. “Everyone has a bath or a shower,” he said. “And I love choreography with water. We thought about recreating The Rite of Spring and then Swan Lake came to mind. I turned the music on and had a splash around.”Baker created the choreography in his own bathroom and made tutorial videos for a global lineup of dancers, some of who also improvised their own moves. Baker found that he had to direct and rehearse with the dancers from his toilet seat, so he could appreciate the confines they were performing within. When he tried to direct from his roomier kitchen, he would be moving around too much and asking them to execute moves that were impossible in their bathrooms.Each performer has been filming themselves on cameraphone, using an app from Filmic Pro that upgrades the quality of the footage. Baker is keen for the film to have a professional finish. Some dancers perform in coloured water one uses the feathery fillings of 20 pillows. “It’s a bit wild,” he says, laughing. “It’s been like hanging a picture blindfolded, a mile away.”Originally from New Zealand, Baker started out in ballet and joined the British company BalletBoyz before forming Corey Baker Dance. The company has often performed in unexpected locations, rather than theatres and opera houses, as Baker is keen to bring dance to new audiences. A lot of his work has concentrated on climate change, such as the dance film Spaghetti Junction, featuring dancers from Hong Kong Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet, which was released on Earth Day as part of Culture in Quarantine.Baker is grateful to have been busy with commissions, and draws attention to how many of his friends in dance and theatre have suffered during the coronavirus outbreak. One upside of the Covid-19 lockdown, he says, is that “the environment is going to benefit from a break and it will give climate scientists a chance to get real data that’s not speculative”. This current period, he suggests, allows “time for us all to think about what is essential, what we need to live and to make our society thrive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214f8025a165c4b4ee1d63360cccd2a60a14bce2/0_0_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10172ae2482d8c1973bf50c0fabfb065","title":"what is it like to live on uk borders during lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from people who live on the border of two nations with different lockdown guidanceAfter Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refused to adopt the British government’s new “stay alert” slogan, instead opting to continue the original advice to “stay home”, the four nations’ approaches to coronavirus has begun to fracture.For those living on the UK’s borders, this ision has left them grappling with conflicting guidelines.

Its star Dave Burd, AKA Lil Dicky, reveals where it all comes fromSo … does Burd, AKA Lil Dicky, really have two “pee holes” and a “dick made of balls”, as he says in the opening episodes of his sitcom Dave? “Everything about my penis in the show is true,” Burd affirms, saying that he was born with a tangled urethra and the condition hypospadias, where the opening to the urethra is on the underside of the end of the penis rather than the tip. “I wanted the show to be as real as possible and to be written from my own experience.”Dick jokes have been the cornerstone of Burd’s craft since he began his music career in 2013 with the release of the song Ex-Boyfriend (about meeting his ex’s boyfriend and standing next to him at a urinal: “This dude’s got a dick that I don’t comprehend  I had to move my neck to see it end to end”). Burd and his 10-part series Dave exist on the knife-edge of profundity, absurdity and hilarity. Co-written by Burd and produced by Seinfeld showrunner Jeff Schaffer, the show focuses on Burd as the eponymous Dave, a Jewish rapper trying to make it in the world of hip-hop as his alter ego Lil Dicky while negotiating his whiteness and litany of insecurities. It largely reflects Burd’s own experience – he quit his job as an advertising copywriter to become a rapper after Ex-Boyfriend hit 1m views in a day once he put it on YouTube.Throughout the show, the penis material underscores a continuing meditation on masculinity, especially in the face of the bravado promoted by Dave’s rap idols, such as Kanye West. We see Burd negotiate an intrinsic belief in himself and his greatness as a rapper with charges of cultural appropriation and the general disbelief of those around him. That meandering between arrogance and humility is reflected in reality too. “In record label meetings in real life, am I saying, ‘I’m Kanye but I’m white?’” Burd asks. “No. But I am saying, ‘I’m Kanye.’”Burd spent a year working on his rap material while working in advertising. “I’ve always believed for no particular reason that I was meant to be a star,” he says. “I always pictured myself being on screen but when I started telling people I wanted to be a rapper, they all thought I was insane. I was on vacation with my parents and my girlfriend in Hawaii just before I put anything online and they went around the table each saying why it would ruin my life.” When Burd’s videos went viral, he finally felt validated.“Imagine believing your whole life that you could be the greatest with nothing to base it on and everyone telling you it’s ridiculous, and then you get a million views in one day,” he says. “It was the best day of my life.” Initially releasing songs for their comedy value – “ridiculous tunes grasping for attention” – Burd soon realised his talent for verbal dexterity and his passion for rap was overtaking his satirical ambitions. “I stumbled into being a rapper,” he say. “I was the kind of guy who wouldn’t even do karaoke since I found it that hard to perform but now I’m so competitive I just want to be the best.”Yet, as a white rapper, Burd understands he exists as a privileged minority in hip-hop. It is an issue he tackles in the show as others question his use of a black hype man – who is also his real-life collaborator GaTa – and his description of some beats as “too urban”. “Cultural appropriation is when you’re stealing from something and not making it your own,” he says, “but when I rap, I try to be objectively unique in myself at all times.

The outcome is, of course, no surprise to Burd. “I’ve always believed that it was going to be a great show because the people who worked on it are too smart and the subject matter is too good,” he says. “I’m relieved because I’ve had one dream my whole life and I did it. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders.”But what about so many people now having an intimate understanding of his biggest insecurity: his penis? “I’m luckily just sitting in my house all day at the moment, so I’m not facing the reality that when I meet someone they might know about my dick,” he says. “And there’s even crazier stories for the next season, so who knows what things will be like when I go outside.”• Dave is on BBC Two on Sundays at 10pm and on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13c5a3f4df4f10bdb6e7bd92f6506303c2c28f7/288_100_4682_2808/master/4682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be1610abf1cba0f59ae944aa2b04b3e3","title":"native americans coronavirus impact","story":"Coronavirus is novel to the world, but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experienceIn the first few weeks of 2020, as president Donald Trump dismissed and mocked warnings about a novel virus killing people faraway in China, Native American leaders were taking the deadly threat seriously.And they were right.The infection rate among the Navajo Nation has now surpassed the state of New York, the centre of the pandemic in the US, and on Monday stood at 2,680 cases per 100,000 people compared with 1,890 in New York.The data emerging from some smaller tribes is even worse. By mid-May, the known infection rate in the Pueblo of Zia, which has a population of 934 people, was 3,319 per 100,000 – ten times the rate of New Mexico where the tribe is situated, and almost double the rate of New Jersey – the second worst hit US state.The nearby Pueblo of San Felipe, population 3,544, is also badly affected with 3,301 known cases per 100,000. Reporting lags mean the actual infection rate for both tribes could be significantly higher.Coronavirus is novel to the world, but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experience. Native Americans feared the worst because they’ve been here before many times.“More than any other population in the country, the shared experience of surviving a pandemic is in our blood, it’s not historic, it’s current for American Indians, it’s our reality. We took it seriously because we had to,” said Desi Rodriguez-Lonebear, a social demographer at the University of Arizona and citizen of the Northern Cheyenne tribe in Montana.As a child, Rodriguez-Lonebear recalls being told by her grandfather not to play in certain spots where their relatives who died of smallpox and typhoid were buried.Now, it’s increasingly thought that the cruel conditions of colonization such as forced displacement, enslavement and starvation created the perfect conditions for deadly disease outbreaks, according to Jeffrey Olster, historian at the University of Oregon.“The impact of Indian removals like the Cherokee trail of tears forced people into horrific conditions of poverty and destitution. It wasn’t just because they weren’t immune, it was the conditions of colonization which made them vulnerable,” said Olster.This would also explain the lack of population rebound after each epidemic: the same horrific conditions caused low life expectancy and high infant and maternal mortality.Again, experts say that parallels can be drawn with what’s happening today as the coronavirus pandemic rages across the US.The disproportionately high Covid-19 infection rates in Indian Country are attributed to chronic structural and economic inequalities such as overcrowded housing, understaffed hospitals, lack of running water and limited internet access – resulting from the US government’s failure to comply with treaty obligations which agreed adequate funding for basic services in exchange for vast amounts of tribal land.“Back then, like today, tribes are trying to tackle a fatal virus without adequate resources. That’s a strong historic parallel, the simple failure of the federal and state governments to provide the resources necessary,” said Ostler.In addition, high rates of medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease have contributed to worse Covid-19 outcomes. For instance in Arizona, the death rate for indigenous people is 42.8 per 100,000 – almost six times higher than for white people. In Mississippi, they are dying from Covid-19 at 10 times the rate of whites, according to analysis published last week by APM Research Lab.Native communities, who rely on their elders for oral history and traditions, are also concerned about the survival of their ancient cultures.“We are survivors of genocide, our numbers prove it… for nations with less than a thousand citizens, losing one person is too many,” said Rodriguez-Lonebear. “And losing even one of our elders threatens the future of our tribal nations as it means losing our language, oral histories and the cornerstones of our families and communities.”In fact, the situation is likely worse as the data currently available is extremely patchy.In New York, where significant ethnic disparities have emerged, no data is being collected on indigenous peoples. “This oversight is especially hammering… it’s a painful blindspot in New York,” said Andi Egbert, senior demographer at APMResearch.Native peoples with Covid-19 are being “eliminated from the data” because their ethnicity is so frequently misclassified or ignored, according to Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the national tribal epidemiology centre based in Seattle.“Without the data, we’re going to keep dying and nobody is going to acknowledge that… and resources allocated by congress won’t reach the communities,” said Echo-Hawk.Over recent weeks, Trump and his supporters have pushed for America to reopen for business, even though scientists are still months from finding a vaccine or treatment.Yet native communities have demonstrated a greater historical awareness of the experience of pandemics, and tried to protect their citizens through measured emergency responses with limited resources, but which assert their right to self determination and governance.“Indigenous nations have been through so many waves of pandemics and epidemics that they have a well of resilience, stamina and intergenerational knowledge that others just do not have,” said Jessica Kolopenuk, a political theorist and indigenous studies scholar at the University of Alberta. “I am of the strong opinion that indigenous knowledge and world views can really help change the course of this pandemic.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8c49d701db20b7b9919ae079b6057d6a382f15/0_0_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9d58717c8ef242ec8c695e61bddc443","title":"nyse reopens two months closing covid 19","story":"Most employees will continue to work remotely those who return will be required to wear face masks and practice social distancingThe New York Stock Exchange’s famous Wall Street trading floor opened on Tuesday for the first time in more than two months, having closed in March due to the spread of Covid-19.Governor Andrew Cuomo rang the opening bell while wearing a face mask, signaling that while New York state may be starting to open up, things will be far from normal for some time yet.“Today I ring in the start of the trading day and the return of traders to the floor of the NYSE,” Cuomo wrote on Twitter. “In the two months the floor was dark, NYers bent the curve and slowed the spread of the virus.”According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, New York is the worst-hit US state by far, with more than 362,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and around 23,500 deaths. Cuomo later reported 73 deaths in the state on Monday, a continued decline, and detailed reopening plans for Long Island and the mid-Hudson region.The Intercontinental Exchange, which runs the NYSE, closed its trading floor in downtown New York City on 23 March, saying all trading would be done electronically. The exchange took precautions while the trading floor was still open, such as testing employees and screening temperatures of anyone who came into the building, but two employees tested positive for Covid-19.The NYSE now says it has consulted with public health and elected officials to develop a protocol that will allow the floor to be open with precautionary measures.“The virus will remain a stubborn reality but we can’t keep the country closed indefinitely,” wrote Stacey Cunningham, president of the NYSE, in a column for the Wall Street Journal this month.“Given that, our reopening will bring a ‘new normal’ for the NYSE, hopefully helping chart a path that other businesses in densely populated areas might follow.”Most employees will continue to work remotely. The small group of traders who are allowed to return will be required to wear face masks and practice social distancing. Anyone entering the building must be screened and undergo a temperature check.Traders must also sign a waiver that acknowledges being on the floor puts them at risk of “contracting Covid-19, respiratory failure, death and transmitting Covid-19 to family or household members and others who may also suffer these effects”, the Journal reported.The paper also said Intercontinental Exchange had asked firms, including major banks, who employ traders on the floor to agree to provide compensation if any lawsuits arise.Traders on the floor must also avoid taking public transportation, a ban that has proved controversial.Transportation news site Streetsblog said the policy was a sign of a potential “carpocalypse” – a rapid rise in cars driving into Manhattan as commuters attempt to avoid public transportation in the wake of the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

It displays a QR code with an inidual’s virus status, which can be used to determine the extent to which the inidual is allowed to move about.Authorities in the city of Hangzhou, a tech hub home to e-commerce giant Alibaba where the app was first launched, have announced they will seek to launch a broader version to monitor people’s health.Sun Yongrong, the director of the Hangzhou health commission, told a meeting on Friday a number of advancements in healthcare administration had already been achieved through the health code app, and proposed integrating the data with more health indicators to develop inidual index rankings.In the proposed app an inidual’s status would be colour-coded and scored out of 100 based on medical records, physical test results, levels of activity and other lifestyle choices such as smoking.Screenshots of the proposed app showed a numeral and colour bar indicating the relative health of the user, and the tracking of factors that contribute to the score, including the number of cigarettes smoked that day, steps taken, or hours slept.For example, drinking a glass of white wine could set your score back by 1.5 points, while sleeping for seven hours could improve it by one point.According to Chinese media reports, Hangzhou authorities plan to have the app ready by the end of next month. The city’s health commission said the proposed system would be a “firewall to enhance people’s health and immunity” after the pandemic.Although apps used during the outbreak have raised concerns about privacy and a lack of transparency in how they operate, Chinese people generally appear to have accepted them as necessary.However, the push to make a permanent version appears to have crossed a line for some. “Outside of the epidemic periods, it has strong privacy issues,” said one commenter on a news article posted to Weibo.Another said: “The boundary between personal health and public health should be reflected. The health code is for others to read. Others have no right to read your personal health reports.”“What the hell do my smoking, drinking and sleeping habits have to do with you?” read another comment on Weibo.“We have no privacy left whatsoever,” lamented another user.The existing apps have run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat, developed for the Chinese government. One commenter said they would delete Alipay from their phone if the app became permanent.Others expressed fear it would be used by insurance companies for tiered pricing, or by employers to screen job applicants.Chinese tech commentator and privacy advocate Lawrence Li said that the new app should ideally be an opt-in system to protect citizens’ rights.Last week’s annual meeting of the Chinese Communist party heard calls from delegates to strengthen oversight of security breaches. There were also calls for the National People’s Congress to speed up the introduction of data protection laws in response to the massive amounts of information collected on Chinese citizens during the pandemic.“Given the data explosion, the demand for data security has become increasingly urgent,” said Wei Ming, a deputy to the congress and chairman and general manager of China Mobile’s Guangdong branch.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and AFP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 25 may","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Dozens of MPs from the ruling Conservative party demand the removal of the prime minister’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, after he insisted he did not regret breaching the government-ordered lockdown.A junior minister resigns, while the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, a former chief whip and a former attorney general are among the Tory MPs to publicly call for Cummings to leave his Downing Street post.Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, says the country has passed its peak of infections on the same day the country records its highest daily death toll. After peaking in mid-May at more than 11,000 new cases per day, the number of daily infections in Russia has dropped to fewer than 9,000.On Tuesday, the country reported its highest daily death toll of 174 – a number still far lower than in countries with similar rates of infections.The number of excess deaths registered in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak is almost 60,000, figures show, underlining Britain’s status as one of the worst-hit countries in Europe.The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday there had been 53,960 excess deaths in England and Wales from the start of the outbreak to 15 May.There were 4,210 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in England and Wales in the week ending 15 May, the fewest since the week ending 3 April.The Spanish government declares 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died in the country the longest official mourning period in the country’s four-decade-old democracy.Flags will be flown at half-mast in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June.Control over Germany’s lockdown measures is increasingly slipping from Angela Merkel’s grasp as more federal states announce unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on social distancing within the country.Winfried Kretschmann, the premier of Baden-Württemberg, announces his state will allow seated public events with up to 100 people form 1 June, adding that there are no plans for further talks on coordinating the responses of Germany’s 16 states.A state of emergency introduced in Hungary to tackle its epidemic is to be lifted on 20 June, the country’s justice minister says, potentially bringing to an end Viktor Orbán’s controversial power to rule by decree.In late March, Hungary’s parliament gave Orbán, the country’s rightwing prime minister, the right to rule by decree indefinitely as part of a package of measures aimed at fighting the epidemic.Spain will ask for the maximum in transfers from the European Union’s pandemic emergency funds, a spokeswoman for its government, says.“We will keep fighting so that the transfers are the largest possible and so it doesn’t mean debt for Spain’s government,” Maria Jesús Montero tells a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting.According to the Johns Hopkins University pandemic tracker, known infections worldwide number at least 5,534,728. The known global death toll stands at 347,587.

He was rushed there by the Jewish volunteer ambulance service, Hatzola, after they had called at his house to check up on him. While he was in hospital, another volunteer organisation took care of Eli’s family’s shopping for Passover as they were self-isolating. Twice, a local restaurant cooked and delivered supper for the family, and when Eli’s wife wanted to send him kosher food to eat and books to read, Lecheiris, a local volunteer group, took the package to the hospital for her.Across the UK, communities have hastily pulled together in the pandemic, with leaflets posted through doors, WhatsApp groups set up and crowdfunders launched. Many people are meeting neighbours for the first time. In Stamford Hill, north London, the networks of support are well established. “Not on my fingers and toes could I count the times I’ve been helped by community organisations recently,” Sufrin said as we chatted on the street during the Jewish holiday of Lag B’Omer.Many strictly Orthodox Jewish families in the Stamford Hill community do not have access to social media and mainstream news outlets, so some were slow to grasp the severity of the situation. “Close-knit means we’re all there for each other and we keep in daily contact. But it also means we tend to congregate more, and the virus has spread much quicker,” said Mrs Davidovits, a part-time teacher and volunteer at the Interlink Foundation.Haredi men pray at least three times daily in the synagogue, and some spend six or seven hours there. So when Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, ordered the closure of all United Synagogues, the largest network of Orthodox synagogues in the country, in the same week that schools across the UK were told to close indefinitely, the community was shaken.Sam Friedman, a local graphic designer saw what was going on and started a physical distancing awareness campaign putting notices in local magazines and on social media. He said: “For some people essential things means going to the supermarket, but for some essential means what’s ideally required by the Jewish law, and that is prayer in groups. Many people have never prayed by themselves in the house setting, with kids around. It’s very tough. These people needed an extra dose of awareness to adhere to the law.”Yoni Koppel works in property maintenance, and for the last three years he has volunteered with Chaveirim in his spare time. Chaveirim offers a free 247 service to help with breakdowns, gas leaks and other odd jobs around the area, but when I met him in April we drove to Homerton and Royal London hospital to drop off food and drink packages to the NHS staff there. Covid-19 has forced many organisations in Stamford Hill to adapt to the needs of the community. “At first my wife was worried,” Yoni said. “But we have been brought up in the same area, and here if people need help you have to put yourself in the frontline. So she does understand.”It’s not only men volunteering to criss-cross town dropping off packages and offering support. But when I reached out to some of the women, they politely declined to talk about it. Mrs Davidovits told me some Haredi women were leading organisations in Stamford Hill, but they did not want to attract attention due to tzniyut, a Hebrew word that best translates as modesty. “It’s not only about the way we dress, but it’s behaviour as well and about putting ourselves out there. It’s very central to our way of life, for men and women.”The virus has shone a light on cracks in every community, but it has also unearthed resilience. The close-knit way of life in Stamford Hill meant lockdown presented previously unimaginable challenges and many were at risk. Everybody knows people who have died. Equally, those like Eli who needed support in a moment of need have undoubtedly received it. Moses Gluck, the undertaker, echoed so many I spoke to when he told me his work was not just business “there has to be heart to it”. Hatzola hasn’t been called to a patient showing Covid-19 symptoms in two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32117b5f04af7421f87fb39615468bd8e5fe3eaa/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41587953f62df663f14fb94b02bc3a5d","title":"research reveals gene role in both dementia and severe covid 19","story":"Having two copies of e4 variant of ApoE gene linked to double risk of severe Covid-19, study suggestsPeople with a genetic mutation that increases the risk of dementia also have a greater chance of having severe Covid-19, researchers have revealed.The study is the latest to suggest genetics may play a role in why some people are more vulnerable to the coronavirus than others, and could help explain why people with dementia have been hard hit: dementia is one of the most common underlying health conditions among those who have died from Covid-19 in England and Wales.“It is not just age: this is an example of a specific gene variant causing vulnerability in some people,” said David Melzer, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Exeter University and a co-author of the study.Writing in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences, Melzer and colleagues report how they analysed data from the UK Biobank, a research endeavour that has collected genetic and health data on 500,000 volunteers aged between 48 and 86.The team focused on a gene called ApoE – this gives rise to proteins involved in carrying fats around the body, and can exist in several forms. One such variant, called “e4”, is known to affect cholesterol levels and processes involved in inflammation, as well as increasing the risk of heart disease and dementia.The researchers found 9,022 of almost 383,000 Biobank participants of European ancestry studied had two copies of the e4 variant, while more than 223,000 had two copies of a variant called “e3”. The former, the team add, have a risk of dementia up to 14-fold higher than the latter.The team then looked at positive tests for Covid-19 between 16 March and 26 April when testing for the coronavirus was largely carried out in hospitals, suggesting the cases were severe. The results reveal 37 people who tested positive for Covid-19 had two copies of the e4 variant of ApoE, while 401 had two copies of the e3 variant. After taking into account various factors, including age and sex, the team say people with two e4 variants had more than double the risk of severe Covid-19 than those with two e3 variants.Melzer said the findings were not down to people with two e4 variants being more likely to be living in a care home – settings that have been hard hit by Covid-19 – since the association remained even when the team excluded participants with a diagnosis of dementia. None of the Covid-19 positive participants with two e4 variants of the ApoE gene had a dementia diagnosis.“It is pretty bulletproof – whatever associated disease we remove, the association is still there. So it looks as if it is the gene variant that is doing it … This association is not driven by people who actually have dementia,” said Melzer.The team say further work is needed to unpick the link.Prof Tara Spires-Jones, an expert in neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, said the large number of Biobank participants meant the association between the ApoE genetic variants and Covid-19 risk was robust, but stressed the study did not prove the former caused the latter. Nevertheless, she said, the study was important.“It is possible that the role of ApoE in the immune system is important in the disease and future research may be able to harness this to develop effective treatments,” she said.Fiona Carragher, a director of research and influencing at Alzheimer’s Society, said people with dementia and their families were desperately worried, adding the government must take urgent action to protect people with dementia. But, she said, more research was needed to delve into the possible link between the e4 variant of ApoE and severe Covid-19.“Other factors may contribute, so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions at this stage. But clearly much more in-depth research is urgently needed to fully understand why people with dementia seem to be at a higher risk and to what extent factors like ethnicity and genetics might play a role,” she said.But Prof David Curtis, honorary professor at the UCL Genetics Institute, urged caution. He noted that among the study’s limitations, diagnoses of dementia in recent years are unlikely to be captured, meaning that the link between the e4 variant and severe Covid-19 may still be driven by more people with two e4 variants having dementia than those with two e3 variants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b9db06878d3a024083c7b4633cacbb1d1a84c31/0_224_5334_3200/master/5334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ebbdb83532eec1b7ab2983ec5874ac","title":"russia to hold victory day parade on 24 june says vladimir putin","story":"President announces new date for military showpiece as rate of Covid-19 infections slowsVladimir Putin has said Russia will hold its postponed Victory Day military parade on 24 June and declared that the country’s coronavirus outbreak has stabilised, on the same day as it posted a record death toll from the virus.The decision to hold the parade in a month’s time is likely to mean thousands of soldiers being scrambled to begin rehearsals for the complex event, while millions of Russians remain under strict orders to shelter at home.The rate of infections in Russia has begun to slow, according to official data, although the country still has the third highest number of confirmed cases of coronavirus after the US and Brazil.Russia said on Tuesday that another 174 people had died from coronavirus, the worst single day death toll yet, although lower than other countries with similar rates of infection.Putin, speaking with senior officials during a conference call, ordered the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to prepare to hold the military parade next month, an event that in normal years brings together more than 10,000 soldiers from around Russia, as well as foreign delegations and war veterans.“I order preparations to begin for the military parade in honour of the 75th anniversary of Victory Day in the capital, Moscow, and in other cities,” Putin said, adding that the situation “in the country as a whole, in most regions and in the armed forces is stable”.He noted that the new date matched the “legendary, historic” Victory Day parade of 1945. Putin also said he hoped the country could hold “Immortal Regiment” marches in late July, where nearly 1 million Russians gather in public to march holding images of family members who fought in the war.Putin was forced to postpone the 9 May parade in April after it became clear the Covid-19 pandemic would make celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany a health hazard. The event is an important public and political holiday and the Kremlin had hoped to host the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and China’s Xi Jinping at the parade. So far the leaders of Moldova and Kazakhstan have confirmed they will attend the rescheduled event.In April the military said it had quarantined more than 10,000 soldiers, after they had remained at a training grounds outside of Moscow until mid-April, weeks after local officials had instituted distancing measures.Video from the training grounds leaked in early April showed thousands of soldiers in formation. The Proekt investigative website reported that more than 376 Russian cadets had fallen ill after the rehearsals, although that has not been confirmed by Russia’s military. Shoigu told Putin on Tuesday that in total 5,500 Russian soldiers had fallen ill with coronavirus since March.Russia has the third largest outbreak of coronavirus in the world behind the US and Brazil, with nearly 350,000 total cases reported. Officials have boasted about low mortality rates for the disease in Russia, although they have warned that death rates from the virus would rise considerably in new data published this month.In several regions, a considerable number of deaths ascribed to pneumonia have not been counted among Russia’s official tally of coronavirus deaths.Several dozen Russian regions have begun relaxing coronavirus quarantine measures, but the country is still identifying between 8,000 and 9,000 cases of coronavirus each day.Putin said: “I order you to ensure the strictest security standards while preparing for the parade. The risks for all participants must be kept to a minimum, and better excluded.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5faded911843398a70710ed833f9b0deed409448/214_215_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c23584e850c4924846c53ccaa0fe401","title":"what is the test track and trace system in england coronavirus","story":"What we know about the government’s plans to help curb the spread of coronavirusThe government’s test, track and trace system to help curb the spread of coronavirus is supposed to be up and running by Monday 1 June.

Last Thursday, Prof John Newton, of Public Health England, told the Downing Street briefing there were advantages to starting one part of the operation ahead of the other.How important is the app?The government initially set great store by it. Hancock is known to be a great fan of technology. It was hoped it would make the work of contact tracing much easier, but the trial on the Isle of Wight has thrown up problems. For one thing, it appears the app does not work so well with Google- and Apple-operated phones.What will the call handlers do?They will work from home initially, and possibly in call centres later. They will be given the details of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 and call them to find out whom they have met in the previous two days. The call handlers will phone those people and advise them and their family to self-isolate for 14 days. They should then check on them regularly to ask how they are and whether they are coping. If any of those contacts becomes ill, the call handlers will ask them in turn for the names and numbers of people they have been with.Will people who get a call and are told to self-isolate cooperate?Some will and some may not. A pilot project run by a group of doctors in Sheffield found a number of problems, including a reluctance by some people to self-isolate when it meant being unable to earn money. Several of those people were working in care homes.Many public health doctors think the tracing schemes should be run at local authority level, by people who are part of the community and will be better able to find and support people, rather than call handlers who may be located in a different part of the country. Contact tracing in the past has been done by local environmental and public health officers.Will Dominic Cummings’ decision to travel 264 miles to Durham to self-isolate make it more difficult for call handlers to persuade people to stay at home?That is the fear of some behavioural scientists. Some families may think if he can interpret the rules how he likes, then so can they."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4262953.1590498634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert q a how do i apply for my calculated grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll Leaving Cert and Leaving Cert Applied students are required to register by 10pm on Thursday for their calculated grades. How do I apply to receive my calculated grades? All Leaving Cert and Leaving Cert Applied students are required to register on gov.ieleavingcertificate by 10pm on Thursday May 28th. Students - where relevant - are also required to confirm the level at which they intended to sit each of their subjects. Cabdidates will have the option of confirming the level or changing to a lower level. When registering on the website, students must have the following information to hand: (1) Your examination number (2) Personal Public Service number (PPS), which you will use to create a four-digit PIN code (3) Email address (4) and mobile phone number.Once the Department of Education has received all the necessary data from schools, students will be asked to opt in through the portal to indicate if they wish to receive calculated gradesHow, simply, will the calculated grades process work?There are two stages to the process.First, teachers will be asked to provide an estimated percentage mark for each student for each subject. Students will also be placed in a rank in their class. These estimates will be based on coursework and in-school assessments over the last two or three years. Secondly, the department will apply a national “standardisation” to the grades. This could result in the adjustment of grades up or down based on a number of data sources.These sources include a school’s achievement in a particular subject over recent years and the proportional distribution of grades nationally, sometimes referred to as a bell-curve.What will happen in the case of a teacher who is due to grade their son or daughter?Teachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.Are there any rules to prevent students or parents lobbying teachers on their grades?Any attempt to inappropriately interfere with the grading process may be recorded by a school and forwarded to the department. In addition, the department has stated that teachers and schools must not be subjected to “any type of influence, inducement (including gifts), pressure or coercion by a parent, student or any other person in relation to a student’s mark or ranking either before or after it has been assigned”.Such contact would be regarded as “totally inappropriate” and a “serious attempt to interfere with the fairness and objectivity” required of teachers and schools in the assigning mark for the students in the school as a whole. I performed terribly in my mocks. What exams or assessments, exactly, will teachers base their judgements on when calculated grades on?The guidance will state that teachers should draw on “existing records and available evidence” such as classwork, homework, class assessments, Christmas and summer exams and mock exams. Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions. As a result, an inidual mock exam should not distort a student’s achievement.What happens with the 100 per cent mark I was due to receive for the cancelled oral exams?The department says these marks are no longer valid and all subjects will be assessed using the calculated grades model. Teachers will be asked to consider what they feel the student would have achieved in the oral exam, based on past performance, as part of the process for awarding calculated grades.What will happen with Leaving Cert candidates who have been studying for subjects outside their schools?In cases where students are studying a subject outside school with a tutor or teacher, this shouldn’t be a problem. Schools will be required to engage with the tutor or teacher (it doesn’t have to be a registered teacher) outside the school when determining a student’s estimated grade. Problems may arise in cases where a student is studying a subject outside school and does not have a tutor. Similarly, there may be issues for an “external candidate” (such as adult learners, home-schooled students or those in alternative or private college that are not officially State-recognised) who does not have a teacher or tutor.A total of 2,858 external candidates are entered to sit the Leaving Cert this year, though it’s hard to say how many do not have a tutor or teacher.Put simply, the calculated grades process is primarily school-based and requires teachers to be able to make an informed estimate of a student’s likely grade based on their work to date. If this evidence is not available, a school principal will not be able to stand over the grade.The department says it will examine all cases on a “case by case” basis, but has acknowledged that some may not be able to receive a calculated grade and will need to wait to sit the written Leaving Cert exams.What happens if a student in a school is taking an extra subject outside the school, such as Polish?A school will be asked to include that tutor’s estimate of a candidate’s mark if the school is satisfied it can stand over the estimate. The student’s performance in that subject will then be amalgamated with the school grades. However, if the school is not satisfied that there is sufficient evidence available to them to stand over any estimated mark, it is required to inform the department. In this case, the student may not receive an estimated result for this subjectMy school is new and has never had a Leaving Cert class before. Will our grades be assessed differently?It is expected that these schools will be advised to work with whatever historical data is available for students during the senior cycle, in the same way as any other school.Will international colleges recognise my calculated grades?Students will receive a State-issued certificate and it is understood that these will be recognised in the UK and EU. Other countries, such as the UK, are also awarding calculated or predicted grades, which in turn will be recognised by Irish third level institutions.When will results be issued?There is no official date yet, but Minister for Education Joe McHugh has signalled that the provisional results will issue as close to the usual time in mid-August as possible.Will I be able to appeal my grades?Yes, but the appeals process will be limited to checking data entry errors rather than reviewing a teacher’s professional judgement.Students will also be entitled to submit a request for their mark and school ranking under data protection legislation. Those who are still unhappy will have the option to sit the deferred Leaving Cert written exams whenever they are held, which will be in line with public health advice. However, it will be too late to start college in the coming academic year based on these exam results Leaving Cert results.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Rite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong timeNetwork could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issues"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJair Bolsonaro greets supporters in Brasília  on Sunday. Photograph:  Evaristo SaAFP via Getty ImagesIn mid-March, Brazil took what seemed to be a forceful early strike against the coronavirus pandemic.The health ministry mandated that cruises be cancelled. It advised local authorities to scrap large-scale events. And it urged travellers arriving from abroad to go into isolation for a week. Although Brazil had yet to report a single death from Covid-19, public health officials appeared to be getting out in front of the virus.They acted on March 13th, just two days after the World Health Organisation called the disease a pandemic.Less than 24 hours later, the ministry watered down its own advice, citing “criticism and suggestions” it had received from local communities.In fact, four people familiar with the incident told Reuters, the change came after intervention from the chief of staff’s office for Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro.“That correction was due to pressure,” said Julio Croda, an epidemiologist who was then the head of the health ministry’s department of immunisation and transmissible diseases. The intervention by the chief of staff’s office has not been previously reported.The about-face, given scant attention at the time, marked a turning point in the federal government’s handling of the crisis, according to the four people. Behind the scenes, they said, power was shifting from the health ministry, the traditional leader on public health matters, to the office of the president’s chief of staff, known as Casa Civil, led by Walter Souza Braga Netto, an army general.Brazil has lost two health ministers in the past six weeks – one was fired, the other resigned after they disagreed publicly with Bolsonaro over how best to combat the virus. The interim leader now in charge of the health ministry is another army general.More importantly, the revisions underlined the hardening of Bolsonaro’s view that keeping Brazil’s economy running was paramount, the people said. Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, has never wavered on that stance formulated during a crucial few days in mid-March, despite domestic and international criticism of his handling of the crisis, and a snowballing death toll.Divergence of viewsBrazil now has the world’s second-worst outbreak behind the United States, with more than 374,000 confirmed cases. More than 23,000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19.“So what?” Bolsonaro said recently when asked by reporters about Brazil’s mounting fatalities. “What do you want me to do?”Casa Civil – the office of the president’s chief of staff – said changes to the March 13th guidance were made by the health ministry, following input from states and municipalities.The health ministry said there had been a ergence of views due to differing situations in states and cities nationwide. It said the implementation of physical distancing measures was the responsibility of local health authorities.“The strategy of the Brazilian response to Covid-19 was not impaired at any point,” the ministry said.Bolsonaro’s office declined to comment for this story.Reuters interviewed more than two dozen current and former government officials, medical experts, healthcare industry representatives and doctors to paint the most complete picture yet of Brazil’s missteps in containing the coronavirus outbreak in South America’s largest country.They described a response that began promisingly, but which was soon hobbled by the president’s clashes with health ministry and cabinet officials who could not persuade him that Brazil’s economic fortunes ultimately hinged on how effectively it tackled its public health emergency.Health experts were sidelined, the people said, and Bolsonaro embraced an unproven remedy to treat Covid-19 infections. Federal co-ordination foundered. State governors – some of whom Bolsonaro regards as re-election rivals – were left to set their own physical distancing policies and secure much of their own tests and equipment, the sources said.Some experts said Brazil’s stumbles are all the more shocking because of its previous success containing malaria, Zika and HIV.“One thing that has been a shining light in Brazil has been their public health system,” said Albert Ko, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health who has decades of experience in Brazil. “To see that all disintegrate so quickly, it’s just been very sad.”Advance warningWhen Brazil’s first coronavirus case was confirmed on February 26th, the health ministry had been preparing for nearly two months.Its personnel were running models to estimate when and how to implement stay-at-home orders in collaboration with state and local officials, sources said. The ministry was the command centre for an emergency committee co-ordinating the federal response across multiple agencies.Brazil’s vast size, underfunded public hospitals and widespread poverty were vulnerabilities. But the country boasts top medical scientists and a competent private healthcare sector. It had weeks of advance warning, as the virus hit countries like China and Italy first. Those on the frontline thought Brazil was in good shape to respond.But the people who spoke with Reuters said things began to unravel along two main fronts: Bolsonaro’s opposition to shutdown measures favoured by the health ministry and the government’s inability to scale up testing quickly.Cabinet members tried numerous times to persuade Bolsonaro to endorse a nationwide lockdown, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. Bolsonaro refused, the person said, believing the virus would soon pass and that health officials were exaggerating the need for physical distancing that had proved effective in other parts of the world.Bolsonaro’s office declined to comment on why he prioritised the economy. He faced pressure to do so, however. Members of his conservative base have protested in cities across Brazil against lockdowns that threaten his promise to rekindle economic growth.Yet Bolsonaro’s economic advisers appeared slow to grasp the scale of the crisis. Economy minister Paulo Guedes, a hardline free market advocate, in mid-March told CNN Brasil that the nation’s economy in 2020 could “reasonably grow 2 per cent or 2.5 per cent with the world falling” because of coronavirus.That prediction was far off the mark. Manufacturing activity has collapsed, unemployment is rising and Brazil’s currency is down around 30 per cent against the dollar this year. On May 15th, Barclays cut its 2020 gross domestic product forecast for Brazil to –5.7 per cent from –3.0 per cent. It cited Brazil’s “ineffective” policy in dealing with the pandemic.The Economy Ministry now projects GDP will contract by 4.7 per cent this year. In an emailed statement, it said its forecasts had evolved in line with the gravity of the situation. Guedes declined a request to comment on his earlier prediction.A Guedes ally, Solange Vieira, who was involved in the government’s landmark pension reform last year, likewise showed little urgency when presented with forecasts in mid-March from the health ministry, according to epidemiologist Croda. The ministry predicted widespread fatalities among Brazil’s elderly if the virus wasn’t contained.“’It’s good that deaths are concentrated among the old,” Croda recalled Vieira saying. “’That will improve our economic performance as it will reduce our pension deficit.’”Croda’s account was backed by another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was told what happened but was not in attendance.Vieira did not respond to a message on LinkedIn. The Superintendence of Private Insurance, which she leads, said in response to questions about her comments that she attended the mid-March meeting at the invitation of then-health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta to understand the ministry’s projections.Vieira observed the impacts of various scenarios “always with a focus on the preservation of lives”, it said in a statement.Guidelines weakenedFor a few days in March, it looked like the fallout from a trip to Florida to meet US president Donald Trump might have altered Bolsonaro’s thinking on coronavirus.Just after returning from the visit, on March 12th, Bolsonaro’s press secretary tested positive for Covid-19. In the following days, nearly two dozen Brazilians who had made the trip would test positive, embarrassing the government and sparking fears that both Bolsonaro and Trump might have been infected.After undergoing a coronavirus test on March 12th, Bolsonaro called on his supporters to suspend nationwide rallies planned for March 15th for fear of worsening the spread. The following day, he said his test came back negative. The health ministry, meanwhile, announced its initial social distancing recommendations at a press conference in the capital.Shortly after the new guidelines were issued on March 13th, Croda said he got a call from his former boss, health surveillance secretary Wanderson Oliveira, who said he was “under lots of pressure from Casa Civil and had to change the communique” published by the ministry outlining the measures. Croda said Oliveira did not say specifically who at Casa Civil had demanded the guidelines be weakened.Within 24 hours, the ministry had changed the recommendations on its website. It removed guidance on self-quarantines for travellers and the cancellation of cruises, saying those measures were up “for review”. And it revised the cancellation of large events to apply only to areas with local transmission.Oliveira did not respond to requests for comment. He recently left the health ministry.On March 15th, Bolsonaro ignored his own pronouncement from three days earlier discouraging mass rallies by his supporters. He met with a friendly crowd of demonstrators outside the presidential palace. Wearing the Brazil national soccer jersey, the president bumped fists and posed for selfies.“It was the first time we saw that totally different stance,” then-health minister Mandetta told Reuters.The next day, on March 16th, Bolsonaro formalised the shift of power away from the health ministry, creating an inter-governmental “crisis cabinet” led by Braga Netto, the army general heading Casa Civil. Brazil registered its first coronavirus death on March 17th.In a response to questions, Braga Netto’s office said the group was formed because the pandemic “transcended” public health.Three people familiar with the situation told Reuters the new cabinet in effect superseded the cross-agency group that had already been set up inside the health ministry. The big difference, they said, was that Braga Netto now had the final say, instead of public health experts, and that economic concerns were given more weight.The health ministry said it would not comment on economic matters. It said the response to coronavirus cut across government departments.Croda left shortly after the creation of the new command centre. He told Reuters he did not want to be held responsible for “excessive deaths.”TensionIn the weeks that followed, policy differences between Bolsonaro and health minister Mandetta broke out in the open. Mandetta continued to advocate for stay-at-home measures in defiance of the president. He also urged caution about the malaria drug chloroquine. Bolsonaro, following the lead of US president Donald Trump, was increasingly promoting the drug as a possible cure for Covid-19 despite little evidence of its efficacy.Mandetta’s popularity added to the tension. An early-April survey by pollster Datafolha showed that the health ministry under his leadership had a 76 per cent approval rating, more than twice that of Bolsonaro.On April 16th, after days of mounting speculation, Bolsonaro fired Mandetta. He replaced him with Nelson Teich, a respected oncologist and healthcare entrepreneur with no public health experience.Two recently departed health ministry sources said the last half of April was lost while Teich “found his feet”. Decisions on testing and new equipment were delayed, they said. More than 15 public health experts, including experienced epidemiologists, left with Mandetta, one of the sources said. Many were replaced by military personnel.“These changes greatly affect the capacity, speed, and the very quality of the response,” said José Temporão, a former health minister who led Brazil’s crisis response to the 2009 swine flu epidemic. “It was a disastrous decision.”The health ministry denied that its response was hampered by the changes.On May 15th, Teich resigned after less than a month on the job. Bolsonaro had criticised him for being too timid in promoting the re-opening of Brazil’s economy and the usage of chloroquine. Teich did not respond to a request for comment.In a televised interview with GloboNews on Sunday, Teich said Bolsonaro’s desire for a rapid expansion of the use of chloroquine in Brazil was what led him to quit.Teich’s departure accelerated military influence within the health ministry. Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty army general with no medical background, is now interim health minister. Of the eight people at the top of the ministry, only one had a military background in March. Now three of them do. At least 13 military personnel also have been appointed to lower ministry positions.Days after Teich’s departure, the ministry cleared the way for the widespread use of chloroquine to treat patients with mild cases of Covid-19.The armed forces are widely respected in Brazil and often help with logistics during emergencies. But Wildo Araujo, a former health ministry official who co-authored one of the country’s first major Covid-19 studies, said military personnel were being placed in unsuitable roles.“I have the utmost respect for the armed forces, but I pity those entering now because they have no idea what to do,” he said. “They don’t know how to deal with the Brazilian public health system.”Brazil’s army declined to comment, referring questions to the health ministry, which also declined to comment on the military’s role.Testing failuresBolsonaro’s opposition to social distancing and refusal to support local authorities in their attempts to impose lockdowns have helped erode compliance with those measures, experts said.A Reuters analysis of Google mobility data, which collates mobile phone movement and compares it to a pre-pandemic benchmark, showed a far smaller reduction in people coming and going from transit hubs and places of work in Brazil than in European countries such as Italy, France and the United Kingdom where shelter-in-place measures have been effective.Reuters also found Brazil’s mobility reduction was less than that of other developing nations, for example Argentina, India and South Africa. Reuters analysed data from 17 countries across Africa, Europe, Latin America and Asia for the month of April.Like other countries, including the United States, Brazil has also struggled to secure the tests it needs. That’s a major failing, some epidemiologists say, which has made it harder to track and control the virus in Brazil.The shortage of tests is due in part to the health ministry’s over-reliance on one institution.According to an internal health ministry document, the ministry began purchasing diagnostic test kits through the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a respected public health institute, between January and February.By April 7th, however, Fiocruz had delivered only 104,872 – or 3.5 percent – of the roughly three million kits the ministry had ordered, the document said. Croda and others said Fiocruz struggled to acquire crucial reagents on the international market. Industry sources said years of budget cuts may also have been a factor.The health ministry should have established a broad network of private and public labs, one source said, which would have improved the ability to procure reagents and process tests.BureaucracyIn a statement, Fiocruz said it had met all its obligations to the health ministry.It said it surpassed an initial target of 220,000 tests by April 13th and delivered nearly 1.3 million tests by the last week of that month. It said it expects to deliver 11.7 million tests by September.“The worldwide competition for this type of test was very large,” it said, “which caused a shortage of products.”Bureaucracy also hamstrung Brazil. A batch of 500,000 antibody tests, used to determine who has had the virus, got stuck at São Paulo’s Guarulhos airport for nine days as the health regulator processed an exception for them to be distributed without Portuguese labels, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.The health ministry declined to comment on the incident. It said it had increased testing capacity and would conduct 46.2 million tests, without specifying a time frame. “The initiative is part of efforts to find new purchases in the national and international market,” it said.As of May 12th, however, Brazil had processed just 482,743 tests. Of the 10 countries with the highest Covid-19 death toll, only the Netherlands had tested fewer people than Brazil - a country with a twelfth of the population. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4262894.1590489400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"might coronavirus trauma permanently change new york","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk along the East River on Monday, US Memorial Day, in New York. Photograph: Jason SzenesEPAJust over a year ago, before the modern plague descended, Manhattan’s Hudson Yards threw a launch party that was Versailles-like in its overabundance of champagne, oysters, top chefs, beautiful people and other trappings of a great city.But on a recent afternoon, Hudson Yards was a ghost town. Its 93,000sq m shopping mall was shuttered and its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, would soon declare bankruptcy. The Vessel public art sculpture – likened by one reviewer to a giant doner kebab, and usually teeming with tourists – was empty but for a security guard patrolling its base.The only foot traffic was a steady stream of soldiers, who had been treating Covid-19 patients at the hastily-erected field hospital at the nearby Javits convention centre. They were lined up, at six-foot intervals, to collect free meals at a Hudson Yards storefront that had been converted into a soup kitchen.Alongside them were delivery drivers, postal workers, office cleaners and others manning the frontlines in New York City’s struggle against coronavirus.The tableau is a reminder of how drastically the virus has transformed New York, which has potentially suffered more deaths than any other city in the world, in just a matter of weeks. As New Yorkers inch towards a reopening, probably next month, according to mayor Bill de Blasio, they are contemplating with trepidation how their city will emerge from the pandemic – and what sort of future it will find on the other side.More than other large cities, New York exemplifies the urban characteristics that the virus has turned into vulnerabilities – population density, sky-high cost of living, a reliance on retail, culture and tourism and a dependence on crowded public transport.The modern history of New York City is one of periodic disasters shadowed by the fear of exodus – to other cities that are cheaper, safer, more convenient. There was the 1970s fiscal crisis and the decay that followed the 1987 stock market crash the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis – not to mention various hurricanes, floods and power outages.Yet in each case the doomsayers were proved wrong. The city bounced back stronger than before, and in some ways, reinvented itself. September 11th, for example, gave rise to a more vibrant downtown and set in motion Hudson Yards, a $25 billion development on Manhattan’s west side that is North America’s largest.After 2008, the world’s financial capital morphed into a technology hub to rival Silicon Valley and strengthened its magnetic pull on a new generation of talent.“No one is working in New York because it’s cheaper or easier. Nobody. It’s because the talent is here,” says Mary Ann Tighe, chair for the tri-state area at CBRE, the real estate services group.Reflexive faithCarl Weisbrod, a veteran of city government who led the revival of Times Square in the late 1980s under Ed Koch and was recently appointed by de Blasio to a new task force to guide the city’s recovery, acknowledges that the next 18 months will be difficult. But he also concludes that “as long as New York holds on to its talent, I have no doubt whatsoever that, as an economic matter, it will recover”.Other civic leaders tend to echo that reflexive faith in New York’s future. Some even talk about a unique opportunity to reimagine the city – to clear away nettlesome business regulation built up over generations, attract new industries, or correct the social inequities exposed by the crisis.As de Blasio said recently: “If ever there was a moment, a breakpoint moment, in the city’s history, this is it. It’s time to look anew at everything we do and see what works, what doesn’t work.”Before New York can set about reinventing itself there is uncertainty, even among its most ardent supporters, as to how the city will bridge the immediate catastrophe. Many are plagued by a troubling sense that this time is different.“This is much more complicated,” says Carol Kellermann, who ran the charitable fund created after the September 11th terror attack and also led the Citizens Budget Commission advisory group. “I think it’s going to have much deeper, longer-lasting impacts.”September 11th was brutal and devastating but the world rallied around the city and its economy resumed within days. After 2008, New York City ended up benefiting from policies that pumped vast sums of liquidity into the financial system.With coronavirus, there is no quick fix in sight. The city’s morgues are overflowing after more than 21,000 fatalities – roughly eight times the city’s toll from the 911 attacks – and some are forecasting unemployment will rise to 20 per cent in June. Yet the city is arousing less sympathy from the nation than partisan resentment. New York feels alone.Worst of all, the very thing that distinguishes New York City and accounts for its unique alchemy – its density –is what makes it so vulnerable to the pandemic. “Other than better treatments and a vaccine, I don’t know that there’s any government policy that can make people feel safer,” Kellermann says.Those with the means have left, quarantining in places such as the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Aspen. How many will have gone for good, she wonders, if the city’s cultural life is effectively closed and therefore unable to offset its high taxes and other indignities.“There’s definitely going to be urban flight,” says Winston Fisher, a third-generation developer, who voiced an ever-present fear among New Yorkers of a certain vintage about a reversion to the bad old days. “I grew up in the city. I’ve been robbed at gunpoint. I remember what 59th and 6th used to look like, Times Square,” he recalls. “New York City can be bad. Don’t forget that.”DecontaminationTo prevent that, there is an emerging consensus that authorities must create a sense of safety, just as they managed to do after September 11th. Otherwise, it will be impossible to restore business – let alone bring back tourists. It is a public health challenge but also a psychological one.In the absence of a vaccine, the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, has turned to former mayor Michael Bloomberg to spearhead a testing and tracing system. The hope is that as the city begins to reopen, the testers will be able to quickly find new infections and seal them off before they become outbreaks. As Cuomo readily acknowledges, it is a huge undertaking.Meanwhile, developers are rushing to refit office buildings that had been designed to accommodate a taste for ever-increasing density. Lifts are being reprogrammed to respond to smartphone apps so there is no need for users to touch a button. Internal doors are being removed for the same purpose.A critical focus in this decontamination is the world’s biggest – and possibly most blighted – underground system. The politan Transportation Authority has begun a regime that would have been unimaginable just a few months ago: to scrub and disinfect each subway car and station every single day.“New York City and the MTA are fundamentally built on density. That density creates intellectual collaboration and culture and business and Wall Street and finance and design,” says Pat Foye, the MTA chairman, explaining the subway’s essential role as the circulatory system for a global metropolis.Foye predicts that new cleaning technologies “could be real game-changers in terms of public confidence in the system”. But cleanliness will come at a cost: he estimates “hundreds of millions of dollars” in additional expense at a time when passenger traffic and fare revenue are down by more than 90 per cent.The MTA has received $3.9 billion (€3.6 bilion) in emergency funding from the federal government and is already pleading for another $3.9 billion infusion just to make it through this year.That is but one example of the fiscal challenges now lurking at every turn. De Blasio, whose administration has added 30,000 workers to the city’s payroll since he took office in 2014, has estimated the budget shortfall caused by the virus shutdown at $7.4 billion. Others have put it closer to $10 billion.Whatever the figure, Seth Pinksy, who led economic development during the Bloomberg administration, worries that it may pose the most direct threat to a virtuous circle in which talent and companies have chased each other to the city.“The key to New York’s success over the last 20-plus years has been the first-class workforce it has been able to attract,” says Pinsky, who recently took over as the head of the 92nd Street Y, one of the city’s leading cultural institutions. “What I worry about is that as government starts to react to the fiscal situation we are going to be forced to make cuts to basic services that are going to be so devastating that they will undermine the quality of life in the city.”Punishing tax cutFinding ways to preserve restaurants, museums, galleries and the like was not just “having a soft spot for arts and culture”, Pinsky says. Rather, it was essential to maintain the appeal – and viability – of an otherwise expensive and challenging place to live.When Donald Trump was elected president, some New Yorkers consoled themselves that he was, at least, one of them, and could therefore be counted on to look out for the city’s interests. But his sustained hostility to the city that voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016 is dimming hopes for federal support.Trump’s 2017 tax cut was largely paid for by punishing New York and a group of other, Democratic-leaning high-tax states. Even if Trump were inclined to help, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has dismissed pleas for coronavirus aid as “blue-state bailouts”.After September 11th, Bloomberg responded to the downturn by raising property taxes, a stream of revenue that accounts for nearly a third of New York City’s $89 billion budget. But that trick will not be easily repeated.Developers may be in no position to shoulder a heavier financial burden at a time when many of their own tenants have stopped paying rent. They are also confronting a larger fear: after a crash course in remote working, some of the city’s biggest employers – including BlackRock and Morgan Stanley – have announced they will require less office space in the future. If that conclusion is widespread, then Manhattan property values may be headed for a reckoning.Even before coronavirus, the wealthy were beginning to flee the city’s rising taxes for places such as Florida and Texas. “People are leaving New York and they’re leaving New York in droves,” says Norman Radow, a one-time New York developer who is now based in Atlanta. The coronavirus, he adds, “is just the icing on the cake”.Still, Radow’s own experience made him wonder if there might be investment opportunities ahead. He first moved to Manhattan in 1978, the depths of the fiscal crisis, and bought a two-bedroom apartment for $63,000. “Everyone thought it was the end of New York,” he recalls. “And look what happened.”Next phaseAmid the wreckage there are shards of hope. Some are warming to the possibility that a city that became so overheated in this cheap-money era – a bastion of billionaires, ensconced in Hudson Yards – might now undergo a pandemic-induced reset. Cheaper rents may eventually make the city more accessible for a new generation, who will put spaces to use in ways their elders can scarcely imagine.“It always happens after every crisis. It seeds the next phase,” says Daniel Kaplan, senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. The shared workspaces provider WeWork, Kaplan notes, was born from the unused office space left in the wake of the 2008 crisis.Kellermann agrees: “My daughter, who’s 35, says it’s going to go back to what it was in the ’70s and ’80s – grittier, but more risk-takers.” (She acknowledges that her daughter had not actually experienced New York in the 1970s – a time when the annual murder rate breached 2,000 and the subway was off-limits after nightfall.)Fisher now sees a rare chance to streamline an antiquated city government and improve the flow of credit to small businesses. Like other members of the business community, he would also like the city to prioritise the life sciences industry as a next source of high-paying jobs – just as the Bloomberg administration cultivated the tech sector.Even with Amazon’s decision last year to cancel plans for a second headquarters in Queens, New York City has still managed to attract billions of dollars in investment from the online retailer, and Facebook and Google, that have shined and reshaped the city’s west side, including Hudson Yards.Weisbrod wants to build more affordable housing. “I think the pendulum has swung way too far against development,” he says. “Everybody says they want more affordable housing but nobody wants it in their neighbourhood.”With coronavirus prying open the public’s eyes to the disparities between rich and poor, there may be the chance. At the same time, Weisbrod and other civic leaders worry how the crisis will eventually shape the city’s politics. Will it be a constructive force that brings reform – or a isive one that ultimately pits communities against one another?The race next year to succeed de Blasio as mayor may be one of the most consequential campaigns in the city’s modern history. Will his successor be another self-described “progressive” or a member of the executive class, in the mold of Bloomberg – or something else entirely? Whoever prevails should have faith in New York’s resilience but also, as Pinsky warns, not forget its darker days.“Those were ugly times,” he says of the 1970s, when New York City’s economic base was wrecked and its population shrank by 800,000 residents. “It took us decades to crawl out of that hole. We should be very careful about not falling back in.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The Briefing, The \u0026#39s two-minute audio updatesNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

GPs were told to stop seeing patients face-to-face and to triage all cases by phone or video in case of infections.As a result of the measures, NHS capacity was not breached, and the Nightingale hospitals were barely used.But there are major concerns about the collateral damage the population is facing because of delays to accessing key health services for a lengthy period.The number of patients given an urgent referral for suspected cancer dropped by a fifth in the first month of the pandemic. Officials believe this is because patients with lumps in their breasts, blood in their urine or other red flag symptoms are putting off seeing a GP until the virus crisis is over.Cancer Research UK estimates that the number of deaths from cancer could rise by 18,000 in one year alone, while doctors have warned of a dramatic fall in the numbers coming forward when they need immediate help, with fears that heart attacks and strokes are being missed until it is too late.Official statistics show less than half as many patients are going to A\u0026ampE, with fewer than one million visits in April compared to 2.1 million a month before the pandemic began. Charities fear a host of other devastating consequences will be seen, either because services were stopped or because the public was fearful of accessing them.Official figures on Friday showed 36,393 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. But the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also tracks excess deaths, which could include people who missed out on care for other conditions because of the crisis. Since the Covid-19 pandemic reached Britain, there have been 44,742  excess deaths in England and Wales compared to what would be expected over the period. Of those, 37,375 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate.As well as cutting lives short, the crisis may have a devastating impact on the quality of many lives, experts have warned. People with dementia may have deteriorated after being denied family visits and because of lack of access to routine services.And postponing operations – such as hip, knee and cataract surgery – has left thousands of people, many elderly, in increased pain or with limited vision. The backlog of cancelled operations could take years to be cleared.Charities have also voiced concern about the impact of the lockdown on the country\u0027s mental health, which will add to pressures facing the NHS. In particular, there are worries about the impact of loneliness and depression on the elderly, with research suggesting it has the same impact on life expectancy as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.Despite a host of technology challenges, the one positive legacy of coronavirus for the NHS is that the restrictions of social distancing have forced a digital revolution that had previously been little more than rhetoric.Nine in 10 GP practices are now offering video consultations, and a recent survey found 18 per cent of hospital specialists have been carrying them out. When the Royal College of Physicians carried out a similar survey last year, they found that fewer than six per cent were doing so.Phone appointments and online messaging have also proved popular, with the NHS now routinely adopting practices which, until recently, had been largely been promoted by the private sector.The desperate hunt for a vaccine or treatment for coronavirus has seen thousands of clinical trials suspended, meaning patients will wait far longer for new therapies, new figures show.Just a quarter of the trials overseen by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) are progressing as usual, with a further 16 per cent forced to make changes. Nearly six in 10 have been stopped entirely.A survey by the institute – to which 4,758 of 5,544 study groups responded – found that 2,817 trials have ground to a halt. If extrapolated to all the trials, it could mean as many as 3,409 have shut down since the start of the epidemic.In March, the NIHR also suspended new applications for trials, saying coronavirus must be given the highest priority, although that decision was reversed on May 21 and the institute said it would be working towards resuming ongoing research and setting up new trials.Yet with labs requisitioned for mass coronavirus testing, a lack of clinical supplies and research nurses drafted to help on the frontline, the U-turn is unlikely to bring any immediate relief.Many patients have been unable to leave lockdown to attend trials, and studies have experienced such damaging interruptions that they will need to start again or have to be abandoned completely. There are also fears that charities will no longer be able to afford to fund research, with many experiencing huge drops in donations since the virus crisis began.The Association of Medical Research Charities (AMRC) believes there will be a £250 million shortfall in available funds for trials and research in 2021 from its members. More than 900 (70 per cent) of clinical studies funded by AMRC charities, involving 148,000 patients, are currently stopped, paused or delayed.Aisling Burnand MBE, the chief executive of AMRC, said: For many patients, the opportunity to take part in clinical research provides hope, and losing this opportunity is devastating. Clinical research is vital to the development of new treatments and improved understanding of diseases, and for some it can be a crucial lifeline. Stopping trials can have a significant physical and emotional impact.Cancer Research UK funds around 200 trials involving 25,000 patients but said it had been forced to cut funding, pause research and stop recruiting for new trials. The charity is expecting to see a 25 per cent decline in fundraising income this year because of the pandemic, which it says will directly impact its goal to see three in four people survive cancer by 2034.Emlyn Samuel, Cancer Research UK\u0027s head of policy, said: This is particularly worrying for cancer patients with few other treatment options.Hospitals where trials have been paused would not have taken the decision lightly – one of the major factors has been concern for patient safety, as the consequences for cancer patients of getting Covid-19 can be very serious. In some cases, patients have continued to be treated on trials thanks to changes to protocol such as follow-up appointments up by phone instead of face-to-face.Plans to get clinical trials back up and running when safe and able to do so are in place, and we\u0027ve heard that some cancer trials have already started recruiting patients again. But it\u0027s important that more trials restart as quickly as possible to ensure cancer patients can access innovative treatments.The British Lung Foundation said it was forced to pause a phase two clinical trial for new drugs to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma, a condition for which there is currently no cure and which just five per cent of men, and 10 per cent of women, survive for more than five years. Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: This is not good news for a cancer where survival rates are dismal and there is no cure.We completely understand the need to focus on Covid-19 right now, but the impact will be colossal, with huge repercussions on the research community and patients who, heartbreakingly, don’t have time to spare. This will mean delays in the trial going ahead and any potential new treatments reaching those who need them.”Elsewhere, most major drugs companies have been forced to stop trials. In March, Geneva-based Addex announced that it would delay the start of a clinical trial to treat involuntary movements in people with Parkinson\u0027s disease.The US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly announced that it would halt enrolment in 86 ongoing studies and delay the launch of new trials, including 30 in final phases. GSK has also paused new trial recruitment, while Roche said it had seen impacts on clinical trial continuity in all the regions where we conduct clinical studies.Belgian drug maker Galapagos has paused enrolment into seven studies of filgotinib, a drug to treat diseases of the immune system.Many life-changing drugs which were expected to come to the market this year are now likely to be delayed, including asthma medicine tezepelumab, fitusiran, a hemophilia therapy, and ozanimod, for multiple sclerosis.The Alzheimer\u0027s Society has called for emergency financial support from the Government to help charities survive the lockdown and get trials back on track. Fiona Carragher, its director of research and influencing, said help was needed to continue funding life-saving research to improve the lives of people with dementia and provide hope for the future.Kate Shaw, the CEO of Innovative Trials, which helps recruit patients, said three-quarters of the trials it supports had been disrupted, and warned that the economic fallout from coronavirus could make it difficult to resume research even after lockdown.Getting trials back up and running will need a lot of investment from pharmaceutical companies, she warned. It will not be business as usual.Dr Elizabeth Robertson, the director of research at Diabetes UK, said many of the healthcare researchers iy funded had been recruited to the NHS frontline.Last week, the NIHR set out a new framework to try and help some trials resume or get started.Dr. William van\u0027t Hoff, the chief executive of the NIHR Clinical Research Network, and senior responsible officer for the NIHR Restart Programme said: We know taking part in healthcare research is good for patients and good for the NHS, so it\u0027s right that we make sure research can be resumed as soon as NHS or care services are able to restart across the country.The claim that coronavirus does not discriminate is inaccurate on many levels. But it is, perhaps, most inaccurate when it comes to its impact on education. In the two months since England, Wales and Scotland closed schools and sent children home, experiences of remote learning have been varied.Some schools have laid out a full timetable of home learning activities for pupils, while others have been slow to get their act together. Even where teachers are doing their best to organise activities for children to work on at home, whether the children actually do the work or not is another matter.Professor Lee Elliot Major, an expert in social mobility, says a home learning ide is inevitable as not all children will benefit from the study space, computers, internet and general support you might find in middle-class households.A poll by the Sutton Trust and Public First, taken just after the Easter holidays, found that two thirds of children had not taken part in any online lessons during lockdown. It also found that pupils at private schools are more than twice as likely to receive daily online tuition than their state-educated peers.  Fifty per cent of teachers in private schools said they are receiving more than three-quarters of work back, compared with 27 per cent in the best state schools and just eight per cent in the least advantaged state schools.  Another indicator of the rich-poor ide in home learning is the boom in online tutoring during lockdown, with many firms reporting a surge in demand for their services. Children from better-off households are more than twice as likely to have had more than £100 spent on their education since the shutdown, a study has found. Ministers have attempted to address the issue by promising to deliver laptops and 4G routers to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.But it is not just children from deprived households that are falling behind. Lazy youngsters, regardless of their family\u0027s income, are also struggling to keep up with their education at home. As the chief inspector of schools pointed out, children who lack motivation will also be among the biggest losers from the lockdown.And apart from the impact on children\u0027s academic progress, there is also the social and emotional cost of closing schools. Children are missing their normal routine, seeing their friends and end-of-year events such as sports day, as well as other rites of passage like a leavers\u0027 ball.Students in older years are missing the opportunity to take their GCSE and A-level exams and are instead being handed predicted grades by their teachers, based on previous work which they did not know at the time would count for anything.Schools have not, of course, been entirely closed during lockdown. They have remained open for the children of key workers and the most vulnerable youngsters, with ministers predicting that up to 10 per cent of pupils would still attend. But in reality, attendance has been as low as one per cent at times, with many parents choosing to keep their children at home even if they are eligible for a school place.The Government had intended for primary schools to begin a phased reopening next month, with pupils in Reception, Year One and Year Six returning first. But in the face of opposition from unions and local councils, ministers now acknowledge that some schools may choose to remain shut for longer.Since lockdown began two months ago, it has been a struggle for the Armed Forces to carry on as normal. In March, the Army halted all face-to-face training, while the May entry for recruits to join the Britannia Royal Navy College in Dartmouth, the naval academy at which the Duke of Edinburgh was trained and where he first met the Queen, was suspended. While a phased restart of socially-distanced training resumed for many at the beginning of the month, the Army acknowledged that any interruption in training has the potential to impact Army numbers. In order to protect the nation, we need to ensure we have enough soldiers trained to continue operations and other essential tasks, it said. Under the new measures, recruits and officer cadets returning to establishments like the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst were informed that, in order to adhere to the Government\u0027s advice, they would become a gated community with all visits off-site, from going home at the weekend to going to the shops, cancelled.James Heappey, the armed forces minister, previously warned that, if training did not resume while lockdown was still in place, we cannot hope to have that capability which we need to keep our nation safe next year. Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence select committee, warned that the virus crisis was proving the perfect global distraction for adversaries and competitors to regroup, as well as weak democracies to see authoritarian leaders leverage legitimate emergency powers to tackle the virus for their own advantage.Threats to global security were already on the increase prior to this outbreak, and we are likely to see a very fragile post-Covid world order, he told The . It\u0027s critical countries such as ourselves take a proactive role on the international stage and resume our duties as quickly as possible.However, Andrew Brooks, the director of Air League, a leading aviation and aerospace charity, said the Ministry of Defence was intelligently managing the risk during the crisis, citing the Typhoon package in Lithuania which has managed to operate within Covid-19 requirements and the way in which HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain\u0027s most powerful warship, was still able to sail with F-35s on board at the end of last month despite the unfolding crisis.  The effects of coronavirus have not just been felt at home. A number of overseas exercises were postponed in order to reduce international travel to a minimum, including the Joint Warrior operation, the largest military exercise in Europe, which brings together all three forces, along with forces from other nations, to practice airborne assaults, amphibious landings, evacuations and live-fire exercises.Other overseas exercises halted included the Swift Response exercise, where 600 British personnel train alongside American and French allies in Croatia, and Prairie Storm, a 35-day exercise on the British Army Training Unit Suffield training area in Canada, which prepares soldiers and officers for future deployments. Training missions in Iraq, where the British Military has held a presence since 2014, were paused for 60 days as a precaution due to the global pandemic.  While the MoD ensured key military personnel retained a presence throughout the country, a number were deployed back to the UK.As the UK has reached the peak of the crisis, the military\u0027s involvement in the pandemic has been reassessed. In a written statement to Parliament earlier this week, Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said the MoD\u0027s contribution and force posture was to be tailored to the evolving situation so it can both respond to Covid-19 and continue fulfilling other critical defence outputs. Now, just 7,500 personnel from its original 20,000 personnel will continue to operate as part of the Covid Support Force, so that they can return to other tasks and preparations for future operations.Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the Royal United Services Institute, added that it was important not to underestimate the lessons that can be learnedfrom the military\u0027s involvement in the Government response to the crisis.One of their top priorities has been to support the national effort at home, he told The . They have done a lot to fill the gaps in civilian absences. They have spare capacity designed to respond to crisis.Mr Chalmers added that one of the questions the military will need to ask is how it recognises and re-prioritises for national military tasks and what lessons the military can contribute to the Government. Perhaps these will be addressed in the long-anticipated Integrated Review of defence and foreign policy, delayed as a result of the pandemic. For now, only time will tell.If it is true that justice delayed is justice denied, then the suspension of all jury trials on March 23 only served to make a growing crisis in this country even worse.Before the lockdown was even announced, the backlog of criminal cases waiting to get going sat at a staggering 37,000. This meant some victims of crime, including those who had been raped or violently assaulted, might have to wait more than a year to see their attacker in the dock.Throughout the two months (and counting) of lockdown, another 2,000 cases have been heaped onto the backlog. Lawyers fear it will be years before the system catches up, increasing the risk that some criminals will escape justice.While the courts might have largely ceased work during the pandemic, criminals did not, so work began last month to try to get things moving again.A Jury Trials Working Group, chaired by Mr Justice Edis, was set up and the first tentative steps to resumption were taken on Monday, with a handful of jury trials beginning at three crown courts including the Old Bailey.There are plans to expand in the coming weeks but, with social distancing measures having to be maintained, even a simple case is proving a logistical headache, with hearings usually spread across two separate rooms connected via video link.As a result, more space is needed and plans are being discussed to commandeer other public buildings such as theatres, churches and leisure centres to serve as temporary courts.More radical proposals, including a move away from the 900-year-old jury system and the introduction of judge-only trials, have also been suggested.The Lord Chief Justice recently warned that the crisis would need some imaginative thinking from the Government, but lawyers fear the delays may take years to resolve.Amanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: In just two months, Covid-19 has struck at the heart of the operation of the entire justice system.Because many courts are closed and others are not operating at anything like full capacity, the existing backlog of cases has increased at an alarming pace, even with the judiciary conducting remote hearings.These ever-growing delays mean witnesses, victims and defendants who are waiting to go to court, are left in limbo, losing engagement with the system and connection to their case.She also warned of the impact the lockdown was having on the legal profession, with a recent survey suggesting that over three quarters of criminal barristers will have gone out of business by October.Caroline Goodwin QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, agreed that the lockdown had dealt a devastating blow to the administration of justice.She said: The upshot of a growing case backlog is that justice is going to be further delayed for victims of crime, their families, witnesses and defendants waiting in limbo to clear their name in court.Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society, also painted a bleak picture and warned that the public\u0027s ability to access swift justice would be severely impacted.Evidence may be impaired by the length of time between the events in issue and the trial. Those wrongly accused will wait far longer to clear their names, he explained. Where people are kept on remand, the remand prison population will increase, and people may end up spending more time in prison than any sentence they would receive if convicted.Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs Council, admitted there was concern among police leaders about the growing backlog, saying: We are working really hard with our Ministry of Justice colleagues to make sure we can get the system up and running as soon as we can. There is a lot of work going on to identify ways to get through the backlog.While jury trials were halted, magistrates\u0027 courts, which handle the bulk of criminal cases, have continued to sit, making use of technology to ensure hearings can still take place.John Bache, the national chair of the Magistrates\u0027 Association, said that, as lockdown was lifted and the justice system began operating fully again, there would inevitably be practical issues to address.By their nature, magistrates\u0027 courts are busy public spaces that bring together people who would not otherwise come into contact with each other, he said. This creates some challenges in how best to enable courts to handle more cases and we are impressed by the continuing efforts of Her Majesty\u0027s Courts and Tribunals Service to protect the health of all court users.This will require an approach that combines a greater use of video technology, rigorous social distancing within courthouses and robust case management to ensure that court time is used efficiently.Police and charities were braced for a surge in domestic violence when Britain went into lockdown, after rises of 30 per cent and more in China and France early in those countries\u0027 outbreaks. In Hubei, the Chinese province at the pandemic epicentre, it tripled year on year in February.What has happened in the UK is, however, more nuanced and as yet not fully explained. Police figures show domestic abuse incidents have risen by just four per cent during the lockdown, although this contrasts with a 25 per cent fall in overall crime in the same period.Yet the number of calls to domestic abuse helplines and online requests for information from charities have risen by 30 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.Charities fear this could be because victims are trapped in their homes with their abusers by the lockdown, out of sight of relatives and neighbours who often raise the alarm on their behalf, and are unable to escape from the house with their controlling partner watching their every move 247.They fear that, coming out of lockdown, there could be an explosion in cases.This was why the Home Office this week launched a code word scheme under which victims will be able to approach staff in supermarkets and pharmacies, say the word and be taken to a safe space in the store to call police or the national domestic abuse helpline.It\u0027s designed for those victims who may have no other opportunity to seek help, maybe because their phone has been removed by the perpetrator or they cannot use it in front of the perpetrator or they may not have internet access, said one of the charity initiators of the scheme.It is also why police – backed by victims\u0027 groups, charities and the Government – have tried to adopt a more proactive approach, including visiting potential abuse victims alone at home. Their partner, who may be subject to bail or a protection order, is told to attend an appointment elsewhere.Police play down reports of a doubling in the rate of women and child murders during the lockdown, which stand at 19, according to the Counting Dead Women group. But charities are prepared for a surge in reports as lockdown is eased and hidden abuse surfaces.And it is not just partner abuse. The pandemic has also shone a light on other Cinderella forms of domestic abuse that have not had the same national profile, or even support. The number of elderly abused by relatives or carers has risen by as much as 37 per cent during lockdown, according to Hourglass, a charity that runs the national helpline for elderly abuse.It has had to ert and increase staffing to deal with the surge in calls. Yet, despite a £60,000 cash injection from the Government, it faces a financial crisis and may have to start scaling back its operations in three months as it digs into reserves.The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it had seen a sharp decline, particularly in elderly people – but also children and young people – with mental health problems seeking help during the lockdown, primarily because of their or their parents\u0027 fears of contracting the virus if they visited NHS centres.Psychiatrists reported seeing a 45 per cent fall in routine appointments but a 43 per cent increase in emergency cases, suggesting people were only seeking help once their mental health reached a crisis. Our fear is that the lockdown is storing up problems which could then lead to a tsunami of referrals, said Professor Wendy Burn, the Royal College president.The past two months have cast the UK economy into the most rapid and brutal recession the nation has ever seen.Eight million furloughed workers are being paid by the Government to down tools and stay at home. Entire industries have closed down overnight. Economic activity has ceased in a way never previously contemplated.It is a deliberate act to stop human contact and slow the spread of the virus. It has been extremely successful, with as much as one third of economic activity wiped out for the period of the lockdown.The usual definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of falling GDP, but this recession\u0027s lightning speed is almost too rapid to meet that description.Rather than the usual recession pattern of a boom turning to bust, this induced collapse sent a stable, if sluggish, economy into instant freefall.GDP fell 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, effectively matching the worst period of the financial crisis even though the virus only really struck the economy in the final month. In March alone, monthly GDP plunged 5.8 per cent, almost matching the entire fall in the financial crisis. Economists expect a fall of as much as 20 per cent in the second quarter.More than one-fifth of the workforce is furloughed, and surveys by the ONS show which industries have been hit hardest.Among businesses that have not permanently closed, more than three-quarters of food services and accommodation workers are being paid by the Treasury to stay at home. Almost two-thirds of those in arts, entertainment and recreation are doing the same, as are 45 per cent of construction workers.Having created the recession, the organs of the state have thrown everything they have at trying to ensure it is only temporary, so businesses and their staff can bridge this hole in GDP and get back to normal as quickly as possible.Andrew Bailey, the new Governor of the Bank of England, ramped up £200 billion of quantitative easing and slashed interest rates to the new record low of 0.1 per cent, even hinting that the Bank could consider taking the rate below zero in future.Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, looks set to borrow more than £300 billion this year to fund the furlough scheme, business loan guarantees, grants to small companies and tax breaks for empty high streets.In a sense, however, the recession may already be over. Some businesses have begun to reopen, which means GDP should be rising once more.Almost 80 per cent of accommodation and food services companies are closed but, of those now open, almost one-fifth reopened in the past fortnight. Construction and manufacturing businesses are also gearing up to go back to work.That said, the level of GDP remains far below its pre-pandemic peak. That means jobs are still at risk – for instance, restaurants implementing social distancing rules need fewer waiting staff, while businesses with depleted resources will have less money to spend on staff or to invest. Job vacancies plunged last month.At best, we are at the bottom of a very long slope leading back to a fully restored economy. Much of the financial pain of this crisis still lies ahead.The charity sector is on its knees, with fundraising activities cancelled, donations drying up and high street shops closed.Yet at a time when finances are stretched to the limit and staff have been furloughed, their services in areas such as domestic abuse, suicide and mental health support, are needed more than ever, with staggering increases in demand.Many, including the Alzheimer\u0027s Society and the NSPCC, have launched appeals for urgent funding, warning that, without a substantial and rapid cash injection, their future is uncertain.As early as March 25, just days into the lockdown, Rob Wilson, the former charities minister, warned in The  that the sector was on the brink of collapse. Weeks on, the outlook remains just as bleak.All the nation’s 11,500 charity shops, which generate annual profits of some £330 million, remain closed, cutting off a vital lifeline for many organisations as well as a wider community resource.Robin Osterley, the chief executive of the Charity Retail Association (CRA), said: Income across the sector has dropped off a cliff. Events can\u0027t be held, street fundraising is on hold, there is a clear trend for people to ert donations away from charities to the NHS.Yet the demand for its services has never been greater – it\u0027s a significant double whammy.It is predicted that charities will have lost more than £4 billion by the end of May. Experts have warned that Government support, which includes a £750 million grant, has not been enough.It\u0027s not about propping up charities, it\u0027s about the continuation of vital services, Mr Osterley said, noting that if furloughed charity workers were allowed to return to work as volunteers – which many are keen to do – that would make a substantial difference.Each organisation is facing its own pressures. The number calling the British Heart Foundation\u0027s helpline has doubled on average since the coronavirus outbreak, requiring it to extend helpline hours and add to its specialist nursing team.Yet with its 750 UK shops closed and fundraising events such as its flagship London to Brighton bike ride cancelled, the pandemic is estimated to be costing the charity around £10 million a month.Childline has been forced to close its night service and has seen volunteer hours drop by 30 per cent due to counsellors having to self-isolate, prompting the NSPCC to appeal to the public for £10 donations to ensure the service continues.More than half the UK\u0027s animal rescue centres have warned they have just three months of income remaining, with many facing imminent closure.And while the Trussell Trust, the country\u0027s biggest food bank network, has reported an 81 per cent increase in demand for emergency food parcels, donations nationally have fallen and volunteers – many of whom are elderly – have been forced to self-isolate.Roberta Fusco, the director of policy and engagement at the Charity Finance Group, said: We are needed now more than ever, but the support has been taken away.It took a long time to get the £750 million package from Government, and we\u0027re still waiting for the majority of that to filter through. Almost three quarters of charities with paid staff are using the furlough scheme, simply as a means to survive. Yet its very use represents a loss of both delivery and capacity.It is not all doom and gloom. The herculean efforts of Captain Tom Moore, who raised £32.8 million for NHS Charities Together, means every NHS charity has been given £35,000 as well as a second grant based on the size of the trust they serve.Other charities have witnessed a spike in donations and volunteers, particularly those providing emergency supplies and meals to the vulnerable, such as the Felix Project in London.Meanwhile, the Government has announced that VAT collected on donated PPE will be given to charities supporting the NHS and care workers.The high street we return to post-lockdown could look very different to the one we left behind, according to retail analysts.While grocery and online sales have boomed with the nation stuck at home, in-store shopping at non-essential retailers has fallen to nothing.This led to a warning from Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, that as many as one in five shops plan to close permanently after restrictions are lifted.Only essential retailers, such as supermarkets, have been allowed to open to customers since the lockdown was announced on March 23, while restaurants have only been allowed to offer takeaways.Richard Lim, of analysts Retail Economics, said: A lot of retailers were already struggling financially so I think, for many, it will be the final nail in the coffin.He said that before the pandemic he estimated retailers had around 20 per cent more store space than they needed or could support. While he had thought this would be stripped out over the next decade, this process will now be accelerated – and that means shops will close their doors for good.However, it hasn\u0027t all been such grim reading. Supermarket sales have performed strongly, as they have been forced to swiftly adapt to a new way of working, and Mr Lim said: The grocery sector has shown its strength in terms of its adaptability.Nick Carroll, of Mintel, another analyst, said that while larger grocers do prepare for cataclysmic events, the pandemic still came relatively out of the blue. Nevertheless, they adapted quickly by boosting the number of delivery slots available and implementing strict social distancing policies in store, including ordered queues to enter and one-way systems inside.The lockdown has also caused changes in consumer behaviour. We have embraced shopping online, with the Royal Mail revealing this week that the number of parcels it handles has increased by 31 per cent during the lockdown.Mr Carroll said 40 per cent of people are spending more online and that this trend has also been reflected with the older generations, with 43 per cent of over-65s doing the same.Shoppers are spending less on luxuries, something Mr Carroll said was to be expected during a recession, which experts warn is looming as a result of the economic impact of the virus.He said: Nearly 46 per cent of people have cut back on non-essential spending. The majority of sales for retailers come from stores, and consumers are cutting back.Despite this, oddly, hobbies appear to have become more important to iniduals during the lockdown, perhaps because people have realised they need to alleviate the boredom of working from home. Sales of items such as board games and puzzles have been strong, according to Mintel.Both analysts said some of these changes in consumer behaviour could be permanent or last for a long time. Data from the Royal Mail suggests four in five people intend to continue spending online at the same level once the lockdown ends.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: Coronavirus has been the single biggest disruption to the retail industry in decades, and the measure of success for many firms will be whether they are still operating in six months time.A glimmer of hope among the storm for retailers will be that many shoppers are looking forward to returning to the high street. The results of research recently carried out by Mintel found that 17 per cent of people are looking forward to a day out shopping when all this is over.They warned of a ticking time bomb. Care homes were already struggling to keep their doors open without hiking rates after their budgets were repeatedly slashed.Now, just when they\u0027re needed most, some have already been forced to close. Many others face imminent collapse after being ravaged by the pandemic. For them, the lockdown has meant they have been locked in with the virus.Almost 15,000 care residents are suspected to have died of Covid-19, according to ONS estimates. Academics at the London School of Economics (LSE) suggest the figure is more like 22,000 – equating to one in 20 care home residents. Healthcare professionals warn the true number is even higher.The Government has released £3.2 billion to local authorities to support public services, including the care sector. Some care home managers have warned that they still have not received a penny of this money, or that they are only receiving a five per cent increase in budget. Last week, as the death toll of the vulnerable and elderly continued to grow, ministers announced a further £600 million injection to help tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes.Despite throwing money at the problem and devolving responsibility to local authorities, central Government is now asking itself – while the public and care sector have demanded to know for months – how, exactly, the lockdown has exacerbated the care homes crisis.Ministers stopped making international comparisons during the daily Downing Street briefings weeks ago, long after backtracking on the herd immunity plan which the World Health Organisation (WHO) deemed a dangerous concept. Now the UK has the highest death toll in Europe – with almost half of those deaths suspected to have been in care homes – and is turning to the rest of the world for help to understand why.Jeremy Hunt, a former Health Secretary who, has begun conducting something of a lessons learned post-mortem into the number of care home deaths in his current role as chair of the health and social care select committee, assembling a panel of witnesses from Hong Kong and Germany. Mr Hunt asked a panel of international experts over a live-streamed hearing why the UK\u0027s care home death toll was so high, saying: There have been 3,000 care home deaths in Germany and 12,500 in the UK. What processes did you take regarding hospital discharges? The answers were clear. The Government\u0027s lockdown strategy meant care home residents had been locked in with the virus, with increasing numbers of infected people allegedly being forced through their doors.Managers have spoken out about being forced to take in infected patients – even if they had not been tested – amid threats of being reported to police or social services. With the sector on the brink of collapse, many had no choice but to attempt to quarantine the sick, often without adequate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). This was the hot topic, she said. Either test or make sure these people coming from hospitals stay in quarantine for 14 days, whether inside the care homes or in separate health facilities like rehabilitation centres. She gave the UK some tips – use Army doctors to help with care, use empty hotels to quarantine the sick and get tests for everyone because some people are asymptomatic.Professor Terry Lum, the head of social work and social administration at Hong Kong University, said: We didn’t have a single healthcare professional being infected in Hong Kong.  In the UK, at least 35 carers have died.  In South Korea, there hasn\u0027t been a single death in a care home, Adelina Comas-Herrera, assistant professorial research fellow at LSE, said. Someone signed off on a policy discharging older patients into care homes full of other older people with underlying health conditions, the legality of which is being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus world round up countries easing lockdown could face","story":"Countries with declining coronavirus infections could face an immediate second peak if they let up on lockdown measures too quickly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. We need also to be cognizant of the fact that the disease can jump up at any time, said WHO emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan on Monday. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now, it is going to keep going down.Meanwhile, the WHO also announced it was suspending trials for a drug touted by Donald Trump as a cure for the coronavirus.The US President revealed he was taking hydroxychloriquine, an anti-malarial drug, last week. The nation has by far the world\u0027s highest death toll, reaching 98,218 on Monday, with more than 1.6 million confirmed infections.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has also heavily promoted hydroxychloroquine while the virus has exploded across nation, which this week became the second most infected in the world after the US.But the WHO decided to cancel trials after studies questioned the drug\u0027s safety, including one published Friday that found it actually increased the risk of death.In the past 24 hours, lockdown measures have been eased in Spain\u0027s two biggest cities Madrid and Barcelona, where people can now meet in groups of up to 10 in their homes or in parks or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. Beaches also reopen in parts of the country after months-long closures.Italy has reopened swimming pools and gyms, while Greece has done the same with restaurants and cafes. In Ukraine, citizens of Kiev can take the metro for the first time in 10 weeks.Iran has reopened its main shrines, India has resumed domestic flights and Japan has stressed caution but lifted a nationwide state of emergency.Joe Biden made his first public appearance in more than two months on Monday as he marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans park near his Delaware home.Since abruptly cancelling a March 10 rally in Cleveland at the onset of the pandemic, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has waged much of his campaign from his home in Wilmington.When Biden emerged on Monday, he wore a face mask, in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has refused to cover his face in public as health officials suggest.Mr Biden and his wife, Jill, laid a wreath of white flowers tied with a white bow, and bowed their heads in silence at the park. He saluted. Never forget the sacrifices that these men and women made, he said after. Never, ever, forget.I feel great to be out here, Mr Biden told reporters, his words muffled through his black cloth mask. His visit to the park was unannounced, and there was no crowd waiting for him.Though low-key, the appearance was a milestone in a presidential campaign that has largely been frozen by the outbreak. While the feasibility of traditional events such as rallies and the presidential conventions are in doubt, Mr Biden\u0027s emergence suggests he won\u0027t spend the nearly five months that remain until the election entirely at home.Saudi Arabia will begin easing restrictions on movement and travel this week, more than two months after stringent measures were introduced to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.Restrictions will be lifted in three phases, culminating in the curfew completely ending - with the exception of the holy city of Mecca - from June 21, the state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday.The Hajj and Umrah pilgrimmages - which attract millions of travelers from around the world - will remain suspended until further notice.The kingdom has so far recorded 74,795 cases of Covid-19 with 399 deaths. More than 2,000 cases are still being reported daily.Saudi Arabia had imposed 24-hour curfews on most towns and cities but eased them for the start of the fasting month of Ramadan. The 24-hour curfew was reimposed during the five-day Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday, which began on Sunday.Demonstrators defied restrictions to march in cities across Ecuador on Monday in protest against President Lenin Moreno\u0027s drastic economic measures to tackle the crisis.Mr Moreno last week announced public spending cuts including the closure of state companies and embassies around the world, but trade unions on Monday said workers were paying a disproportionate price compared to Ecuador\u0027s elite.Around 2,000 people marched in the capital, waving flags and banners and shouting anti-government slogans.Coronavirus has caused at least 3,200 deaths in the country, making it South America\u0027s worst hit nation per capita. Authorities say more than 2,000 further deaths are likely linked to the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dunkirk evacuation no miracle","story":"Eighty years ago a new phrase entered the British lexicon – The Dunkirk Spirit. Defined as “the spirit of the British public pulling together to overcome times of adversity”, it has particular resonance today. On 26th May 1940 Operation Dynamo, the mission to rescue the British Expeditionary Force from France, began. The herculean efforts of the Royal Navy, the Merchant Navy and civilian volunteers, have become embedded in our national story.In his ‘we shall fight them on the beaches’ speech nine days later, Churchill said that “Wars are not won by evacuations”. True, but he knew they can be lost if such operations go badly wrong as for many days in that torrid time seemed all too likely.The Dunkirk story is now legendary. The qualities of courage and resilience in the face of extreme adversity are part of our identity, how we think of ourselves. This is exemplified by the Little Ships - the story of how a civilian armada helped save an army. Some say it was a miracle – an event so extraordinary that it surpasses all human powers. The truth is far more gutsy and practical, and utterly remarkable.Dunkirk was not a planned operation but an improvised one where initiative largely took the place of planning. Behind it all and led by the brilliant – and now overlooked – Vice Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, was a small team of men and women who, in tunnels deep under Dover Castle, hatched and guided the plan, adapting it to bounce back after every setback. In only a few days this team somehow found all the resources in ships, people and supplies required to lift an army. It was an almost superhuman effort, conducted by ordinary men and women. When it is safe to do so, you will be able once again to visit those tunnels, where English Heritage’s superb series of videos unfolds the story in the place where it actually happened.In France, retreating British and French forces dug in and held an area around Dunkirk while the evacuation proceeded. On the way in and out, ships had to fight off aircraft, E-boats and shore batteries, and negotiate explosive mines. Another, largely invisible, battle took place in the sky as the RAF engaged the Luftwaffe: catastrophic though the bombing of ships and beaches was, with over 230 vessels sunk, it could have been so much worse. It was an inferno in which the courage and determination of all those involved from all three Services enabled it enormously to exceed expectations. Having initially thought that about 50,000 could be saved, the total recovered was nearly 340,000, including some 140,000 French, Belgian and Dutch.Without the guiding hand of Ramsay and his team, it would have been a shambles. In a letter to his wife on 5th June he wrote: “… now all is done and the task is behind. The relief is stupendous. The results beyond belief. The success is mostly due to the first-class direction and management of the show, equally with glorious courage, skill and endurance of the personnel of all the ships. The one without the other would have been ineffective….”Although the circumstances of today are totally different, inevitably people will seek parallels. Improvisation was the key, together with quick decision-making 24 hours a day, often based on very limited information. Ideas had to be tried if they didn’t work – try something different.  Many mistakes were made and opportunities lost – it’s inevitable in chaotic situations like this. No decision one can take is without risk. Behind the apparent chaos – detailed planning, ruthless oversight by small,  focussed teams, and constant adjustments as the situation on the ground changed.

Employers asking workers to come in have been told to put in place measures to protect them from coronavirus, such as staggering shift patterns. New official data has revealed inequalities in working from home across Britain, with fewer than one third of workers able to do so in some areas of the country.Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that only one in three workers in the East Midlands and the east of England said they worked from home between April 3 and May 3 because of the coronavirus crisis.The percentage of workers who worked from home in London was the highest, at 60.6 per cent, followed by the south-east (50.4 per cent), the West Midlands (49.6 per cent), Yorkshire and the Humber (49.1 per cent), the north-west (45.5 per cent) and the south-west (44.4 per cent). The lowest percentage of workers able to work from home for the same period was in the East Midlands (32.6 per cent), the east of England (33 per cent) and the north-east (35.5 per cent). Meanwhile, the figure for Wales was 40.3 per cent and that for Scotland 42.8 per cent.The ONS data also showed that, while Londoners are most likely to work from home they are least likely to check on their neighbours.More than three-quarters of people across Great Britain thought people have been doing more to help others since the pandemic began, with people in Yorkshire and the Humber and the south-east slightly more optimistic, at 84 per cent, than both London and the north-east, at around 76 per cent. The capital saw the fewest people checking on neighbours, with 39 per cent of people saying they never checked and 48 per cent saying they did so at least once. The most neighbourly area was the south-west, where 64 per cent of people checked on their neighbours at least once and only 24 per cent had never checked.James P Harris, the cities statistician at the ONS, said: This is the first time we have analysed the country and the regional differences in our regular research into how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting people\u0027s lives.Levels of worry and concern are high across all countries and regions, with many of us keeping in touch with families and friends, but we also find differences in how lockdown has affected people around Great Britain.People in London were more likely to be working from home, with those in the east and the East Midlands least likely, for example. Those in Scotland and the north-east were most optimistic about their household finances. People in the south-west have been most likely to check on their neighbours. We also found that people in Wales tend to have access to a garden, unlike Londoners, who were more likely to use public parks.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should have gone barnard castle social media users mock cummings","story":"Dominic Cummings has been known for his brilliance in harnessing the power of social media to campaign against political opponents.However, the special adviser is now trending in a way he probably never thought he would - as the butt of many jokes and memes about his trip to Barnard Castle.Many made the point that an hour-long round trip in the car with a small child in the back was an unconventional way to test eyesight, joking that one should have gone to Barnard Castle instead of Specsavers.The Barnard Castle TripAdvisor page was also full of spoof reviews from people enjoying the joke.One wrote: Whizzed up on a whim from London with the family.

We must use that to the maximum in the period ahead, adding that they must intensively communicate with key markets to attract guests.The streets have been empty in DubrovnikRead the full story here.One of the UK’s leading ski schools is encouraging skiers to keep their dreams of the slopes alive despite the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the world of travel.The Warren Smith Ski Academy has seen an overwhelming response to its series of online ski lessons, which it launched in the wake of the pandemic.“It’s gone way further than we expected, it’s the biggest thing we’ve ever done.

Check out our article.Glamping bookings are on the upGreece hopes to welcome foreign tourists from June 15, but Britons could be blocked from visiting due to the UK\u0027s relatively high Covid-19 infection rate. The Mediterranean summer holiday favourite restarted regular ferry services to its islands on Monday as it presses ahead with efforts to salvage its vital tourism season.Foreign arrivals are currently required to self-isolate for two weeks, but that policy will be relaxed by June 15 and direct flights to the Greek islands allowed to resume from July 1. However, it has been suggested that Britons, along with those from the US and Russia, will face a longer wait before they can return. I think that the UK has a big difference in terms of the current medical status of the country with Greece, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s likely it will be there, tourism minister Harry Theocharis told ITV. The UK recorded 1,625 new coronavirus cases and 121 new deaths on Monday, while in Greece the figure was just 4 and 1, respectively. For comparison, Germany saw 461 new cases and 57 new deaths yesterday and Italy 300 and 92.Greece\u0027s reticence to allow Britons to return could be a moot point, of course.

Skiers and snowboarders will have to make a reservation before they visit and there will only be a small, limited number of lift tickets available to buy in advance – just 600 people will be allowed on the mountain each day.The resort joins a list of other American resorts that have decided to make the most of the remaining snow – Mount Baldy in California reopened last month much to the delight of its local fans, despite state and local orders prohibiting non-essential businesses from operating amid the pandemic. Arapahoe, which boasts an impressive snow record, is often one of the last resorts in the northern hemisphere to close each year, with skiing often possible until the Independence Day weekend and July 4 celebrations.Arapahoe ski resort will reopen tomorrowNeed some UK inspiration? Here are 10 great summer holiday ideas, from remote hikes to luxury yurts, chosen by Penny Walker. Explore the great British outdoors this summerCharlotte Johnstone reports that the loss of Shearings, the UK\u0027s biggest coach tour company, could have a devastating impact on dozens of popular holiday spots:The firm\u0027s three accommodation brands, Bay Hotels, Coast \u0026amp Country Hotels and Country Living Hotels, operated 44 UK properties in towns such as Harrogate, Bath, Newquay, Torquay and Llandudno. With the collapse of Shearings, they too have ceased trading, and unless they can find a new buyer willing to take a gamble on making money in the current climate, face permanent closure.The low-cost airline will return to the sky on June 15 and has shared its first post-coronavirus route map. It\u0027s a skeleton affair, with services to only 22 airports. UK routes include Gatwick to Edinburgh, Belfast, the Isle of Man, Inverness, Glasgow and Nice (its solitary route from Britain to Europe). Greg Dickinson reports that Japan is looking to boost tourism by subsidising a portion of travellers’ expenses, as the country lifts its state of emergency and eases lockdown restrictions.In a news conference last week, Hiroshi Tabata of the Japan Tourism Agency announced plans to allocate $12.5 billion (£10.2 billion) to a new reimbursement programme for tourism.It is not clear whether the scheme would target domestic tourists only, or if it could be rolled out to international visitors as well. Some reports suggest Japan could follow the lead of Sicily, which is looking to lure back foreign travellers by paying half their air fares and offering one free night of accommodation for every three nights spent there.The Portuguese islands of Madeira and Porto Santo will reopen to international travellers on July 1, it has been announced.Arrivals will have to either present a negative coronavirus test done no more than 72 hours prior to departure or be tested upon arrival, free of charge.Madeira has spent recent weeks billing itself as a Covid-free destination, while the rest of Portugal has been equally keen to kickstart tourism. The country\u0027s Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said last week that travellers will soon be welcome to return with no obligation to self-isolate on arrival. Madeira is getting ready to reopenSimon Parker isn\u0027t letting the lockdown stop him wandering the globe:First in are the French beans. Their remains have been found in Mexican and Guatemalan archaeological sites that date back 7,000 years, but they were most likely first domesticated in Peru.Christopher Columbus introduced them to Europe at the end of the 1400s, and over the next few centuries they migrated east to Indochina and the Indian subcontinent. I’ve seen them grow as big as boomerangs in the foothills of the Himalayas under multi-coloured prayer flags. Some French restaurants serve them crunchy, in goose fat and breadcrumbs, but I’ll likely cook mine Bhutanese-style, in a cheese and chilli sauce. My taste buds can still wander, even if the rest of me can’t. While it seems Britons must wait until July 4 to enjoy a domestic holiday, the Isle of Man yesterday gave the green light for self-catering properties to reopen. The move comes after camping facilities were given permission a week ago.Travel between the Isle of Man and the UK is still prohibited, but it is hoped islanders will take the chance to enjoy a “staycation” in the coming weeks. Other lifestyle businesses on the Isle of Man are due to reopen next month, including restaurants with outdoor seating, hair salons and tattoo parlours. Once travel restrictions are lifted, Britons may wish to visit too – the Isle of Man, part of the Common Travel Area, will be exempt from the UK’s new quarantine policy. However, that could take some time. Only during the final phase of the island’s six-step reopening plan will border restrictions be lifted, and that will be dependent on the situation in the UK.Should we head there in any large number this summer, it wouldn’t be the first time. The Isle of Man was once the holiday destination of choice for countless Britons. Talk about stating the bleeding obvious...With Italy hoping to welcome foreign tourists from early next month, the archaeological site of Pompeii has reopened to the public for the first time since March. From today, visitors will be able to walk a specific route through the ruins. They must book a time slot online and only 40 people will be permitted to visit every 15 minutes. All visitors must pass through thermal scanners and are obliged to wear masks. Social distancing must also be maintained. On the plus side, tickets have been reduced to €5 until June 9, when the while site will reopen. The ruins reopened this morningLatam Airlines, South America\u0027s biggest carrier, has filed for bankruptcy as it battles to survive the Covid-19 crisis. Passenger and cargo flights will continue to operate, and employees will still be paid.

Rob Crossan is confused:It would normally require the illogicality of a Kafka novel combined with the surrealism of a Magritte painting to be in a situation where a citizen of Normandy would find it quicker and easier to get to Dubrovnik than to Dover. But, of course, as Franz Kafka knew only too well, there are ‘facts’, and then there are facts. And, in the midst of the whirling dervish of science, rumour, fear and mis-trust that roars around the margins of Covid-19, nothing, not even summer holidays, are spared the torture of this potentially ruinous confusion.The science that much of the rest of Europe is adhering to when it comes to the easing of travel restrictions is being wilfully ignored by the UK. Just as Italy, Spain, Greece and Iceland are lifting their borders, we’re shutting them ever tighter.While Britons are still not allowed to pitch a tent in an empty field, Iceland reopened its nightclub and gyms yesterday and gave the all-clear for public gatherings of up to 200 people.Iceland started lifting restrictions in early May, allowing hair salons, museums and schools to reopen, after the country\u0027s chief epidemiologist said its outbreak was past its peak. No rise in infections has subsequently been reported. Everyone arriving in Iceland from abroad is currently required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival, but the country\u0027s government says it intends to ease restrictions on international visitors by June 15 at the latest.Spain will welcome foreign tourists back to the country from July 1, ending its two-week quarantine policy, and the move has been welcomed by Europe\u0027s biggest low-cost airline.Ryanair\u0027s CEO Eddie Wilson said: After four months of lockdown, we welcome moves by governments in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus to open their borders, remove travel restrictions and scrap ineffective quarantines. Ryanair will be offering up to 1,000 daily flights from July 1. All will operate with new health guidelines in place, which will require all passengers to wear face masks in the airport and on board aircraft.Despite a few reports of rowdiness on the Kent coast, the vast majority of Britons appear to have enjoyed an incident-free bank holiday weekend in the sun.

The object was studied from scientists across the world who were unable to explain why it looked something like a supernova explosion but had some strange differences.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe object was incredibly bright initially, for instance, but then faded away in just a few days.Researchers then began to look at another two blasts, from 2016 and 2018, which showed similar unusual characteristics. Researchers found themselves struggling to explain those two explosions, too.Earth’s magnetic field weakening, causing chaos for satellitesOne of the objects became so bright so quickly that the scientist studying it thought she had made a mistake. The other threw out an unexpected material through space at more than half the speed of light, leading researchers to puzzle over the discovery.“It took almost two years to figure out what we were looking at just because it was so unusual, said Raffaella Margutti from Northwestern University, the co-author on one of a number of studies examining the new kinds of explosions.The researchers then realised the three unexplained objects had characteristics in common and that they appeared to be a new class of explosion, different from any others. They named the phenomena Fast Blue Optical Transients, or FBOTs.The material being thrown out of those FBOTs is some of the fastest outflows ever seen in nature. While other explosions have ejected material faster, they tend to throw out a much smaller amount of mass, and so the new explosion represents a whole new kind of extreme phenomenon.“We thought we knew what produced the fastest outflows in nature,” said Margutti. “We thought there were only two ways to produce them – by collapsing a massive star with a gamma-ray burst or two neutron stars merging. We thought that was it.With this study, we are introducing a third way to launch these outflows. There is a new beast out there, and it’s able to produce the same energetic phenomenon.”Astronomers say that the FBOTs probably begin in the same way as other dramatic supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, when a massive sun explodes at the end of its life. But it is after that explosion that the differences become clear.Normally, a supernova sends a spherical blast of material out into space, and when a disc forms around it then it may send a gamma-ray burst across the universe, with that disc working as an engine.

Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies head, said the virus could “jump up at any time” even in countries where infections have been falling.Meanwhile, the a clinical trial into a malaria drug touted by Donald Trump as a Covid-19 preventative has been halted over safety fears. The WHO said testings involving hydroxychloroquine had been suspended while “data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDeaths in England and Wales\u0026nbsppass 40,000Minister resigns in protest over Dominic Cummings lockdown breachCountries lifting lockdowns could face \u0027immediate second peak\u0027 in infectionsGovernment \u0027looking into\u0027 letting people visit another householdAsked why people could not visit different households, such as where grandparents live, but non-essential shops and schools would reopen, Mr Hancock said: One of the challenges is that it is very difficult to know where the virus has passed from and to.There is also a yearning to see people in another household, and we are looking at how we can make this happen in a safe way.UK can begin to replenish PPE stockpiles, health secretary saysMatt Hancock, the health secretary, said the UK can now begin to replenish its personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles after brokering new deals and increasing manufacture.He told the daily Downing Street press conference: I can announce that we have now signed contracts to manufacture two billion items of PPE here in the UK.Around the world, we\u0027ve signed deals with over 100 new suppliers including agreeing contracts for a further 3.7 billion gloves.While we continue to improve the logistics and work hard to get everyone the PPE they need, these new supplies mean we\u0027re not simply keeping up with demand, we\u0027re now able to begin to replenish our stockpiles.Spain\u0027s death toll reaches 27,117Spain\u0027s Health Ministry said\u0026nbspa total of 27,117 people had died from the coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak.Confirmed cases of the virus reached 236,259, the ministry said.Yesterday, the government revised down the country\u0027s cumulative death toll by nearly 2,000 after checking data provided by regions, a move that drew sharp criticism from political opponents.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson invites Vladimir Putin to summit on vaccine developmentBoris Johnson has invited Russia\u0027s president,\u0026nbspVladimir Putin, to attend an online summit on the development of a coronavirus vaccine.\u0026nbspThe British Embassy said Mr\u0026nbspJohnson had officially invited Mr Putin to attend the Global Vaccine Summit 2020 hosted by Britain on 4 June.\u0026nbspThe embassy statement indicates the summit will focus on securing the critical support required for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to continue its vital work and to help ensure that any vaccine developed for Covid-19 is available for the whole world.\u0026nbspSeveral Russian labs have been developing anti-coronavirus vaccines and testing on humans was expected to start next month.\u0026nbspVenezuela\u0027s health system \u0027grossly unprepared\u0027 to deal with coronavirus, report saysA report says Venezuela\u0027s broken health system is grossly unprepared to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, warning overcrowding and limited access to water in hospitals and homes make it likely the coronavirus illness will rapidly spread.\u0026nbspThe report by Human Right Watch and Johns Hopkins University\u0027s Centers for Public Health and Human Rights and for Humanitarian Health says the massive exodus of Venezuelans and crossing of the country\u0027s borders due to the pandemic is increasing the risk of spread.The report says, Venezuela had 1,121 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 10 deaths on Monday.But the real number is almost certainly much higher, given the limited availability of reliable testing, limited transparency, and the persecution of medical professionals and journalists who report on this issue.\u0026nbspHuman Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins urged UN\u0026nbspsecretary-general Antonio Guterres and UN\u0026nbsphumanitarian chief Mark Lowcock to lead efforts to address this humanitarian emergency.\u0026nbspThey called on the Lima Group of mostly conservative-run regional countries seeking to defuse the crisis in Venezuela as well as the United States and the European Union to press Maduro to immediately open doors to a full-scale, UN-led humanitarian response to prevent catastrophic spread of Covid-19.\u0026nbspItaly\u0027s Red Cross calls for citizens to test blood for coronavirus antibodiesItaly\u0027s health minister is appealing to citizens to answer the Red Cross call for a blood test to determine if they have antibodies to COVID-19.\u0026nbspRed Cross volunteers began making phone calls today\u0026nbspto a representative sample of people throughout Italy.Roberto Speranza told Sky TG24 TV the goal is to better understand how many people have developed antibodies.\u0026nbspExperts say many people without COVID-19 symptoms in the country where Europe\u0027s outbreak began were likely infected but were never tested. Mr Speranza said the blood test results of 150,000 people can be applied to the entire country.\u0026nbspMr Speranza said people with antibodies will quickly receive a test for Covid-19 to see if they have an active infection. Italy is considering a tentative lifting of restrictions of travel between regions in the country on 3 June.\u0026nbspScientists have cautioned they don\u0027t know if antibodies guarantee immunity, and if they do, how long such immunity lasts.\u0026nbspAmericas becomes new pandemic epicentre, WHO saysThe World Health Organisation (WHO) considers the Americas the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, and now is not the time for countries to ease restrictions, officials said in a briefing.Carissa Etienne, WHO director for the Americas and head of the Pan American Health Organisation, said via videoconference that outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a 7-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began.Hydroxychloroquine results expected next month, WHO saysThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said\u0026nbspa safety team would review data on hydroxychloroquine by next month, a day after officials cited safety concerns that prompted them to suspend use of the malaria drug in a global trial in Covid-19 patients.The WHO called time on using the drug in its multi-country trial, called Solidarity, after a study published in British medical journal The Lancet\u0026nbspfound patients randomised to get hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had increased mortality rates and higher frequency of irregular heartbeats.Donald Trump and others have pushed HCQ as a possible treatment for the disease.A final decision on the harm, benefit or lack of benefit of hydroxychloroquine will be made once the evidence has been reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, the WHO said.This review will include data from the Solidarity Trial and other ongoing trials, as well as any evidence published so far. It is expected by mid-June.Department of Health refuses to comment on why it cannot provide testing figuresThe Department of Health has declined to say why it cannot provide figures for how many people are being tested for coronavirus.A daily tally of coronavirus tests is still being provided, but not the breakdown of how many people this includes.A spokesman said technical difficulties meant the number of people being tested cannot be reported but declined to say what these issues were.The most recent data shows there were 109,979 tests carried out on 25 May.Spanish death toll reaches 27,000Spain\u0027s Health Ministry reported\u0026nbspthat a total of 27,119 people had died from the coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak.Confirmed cases of the virus reached 236,259, the ministry said.Today, the government revised down the country\u0027s cumulative death toll by nearly 2,000 after checking data provided by regions, a move which drew sharp criticism from political opponents.\u0026nbspAround 90 5G masts attacked during lockdownThe number of attacks on mobile phone masts has climbed to around 90 since the coronavirus lockdown began, the UK\u0027s network trade body has revealed.MobileUK said it has currently recorded 87 arson incidents against network towers across the country, but warned there might be a delay on information from over the bank holiday weekend.Attacks against mobile masts have surged since March amid conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to the spread of Covid-19, a claim experts and scientists have called unproven, baseless and utter rubbish.One attack reported in April was on a mast serving the Nightingale hospital in Birmingham.Theories being spread about 5G are baseless and are not grounded in credible scientific theory, Mobile UK has repeatedly argued.Mobile operators are dedicated to keeping the UK connected, and careless talk could cause untold damage.Continuing attacks on mobile infrastructure risks lives and at this challenging time the UK\u0027s critical sectors must be able to focus all their efforts fighting this pandemic.Coronavirus \u0027disastrous\u0027 for children\u0027s rightsMeasures to taken by governments to curb the outbreak of coronavirus have had a disastrous impact on many children, a report has warned.School closures affecting\u0026nbsp1.5 billion children across 188 countries have left\u0026nbspboys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, child marriage,\u0026nbspteenage pregnancy, and domestic violence, according to the NGO Kids Right.It also warns unprecedented pressure on healthcare has shut down regular vaccination programmes\u0026nbspsuch as polio and measles and will cause a spike of hundreds of thousands in additional infant mortality.The United Nations estimates that an extra 42 to 66 million children could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis this year, the report notes.Scottish Tory leader calls for resignation of Dominic CummingsThe leader of the Scottish Conservative Party Jackson Carlaw has called on Boris Johnson’s under-pressure advisor Dominic Cummings to resign.The MSP said the scandal over the strategist’s trip from London to Durham during the lockdown was proving too much of a distraction.Carlaw said he had made his view that\u0026nbspCummings should “consider his position” known to Downing Street, according to both the BBC and STV.It\u0026nbspfollows the resignation of Douglas Ross, the Under Secretary of State for Scotland, from the government over the issue earlier today.No reason to keep Swedes out when Nordic neighbours reopen borders, insists minister\u0026nbspExcluding Sweden from moves to open borders across the Nordic region as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic would be a political decision and not justifiable on health grounds, the country\u0027s foreign\u0026nbspAnn Linde has said.With many European countries looking to ease travel restrictions ahead of the summer, there are concerns elsewhere in the Nordic region that allowing Swedish tourists in could increase the risk of new infections.Sweden has not imposed a sweeping lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus, and\u0026nbsphe country\u0027s death toll of 4,000 is\u0026nbspnearly four times the combined total of the other Nordic countries.Swedish media has raised concerns that the country\u0026nbspcould be excluded as curbs on travel are relaxed, both in the Nordic region and elsewhere in Europe.It is a very complicated issue, and I think that all politicians in every country should also look at the long term effect before they take very politically motivated decisions, Linde said.Uber cuts 600 jobs in IndiaUber has cut about 600 jobs in India as part of plans to reduce its global workforce by 23 per cent, the company has said, joining local rival Ola as the Covid-19 pandemic crushes demand for app-based cab services.Last week, Uber said it would focus on its core businesses in ride-hailing and food delivery and cut staffing globally in an attempt to become profitable despite the coronavirus pandemic.The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber India SA with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce, Uber India and South Asia president Pradeep Parameswaran said.Laid off employees will receive a minimum of 10 weeks\u0027\u0026nbspworth of payout, medical insurance coverage for the next six months and other help, Mr Parameswaran added.The ride-hailing taxi business in India came to a halt in late March as the government enforced a countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since been eased, but companies across sectors face challenges as demand for their services has dropped.South Korea reports 19 new cases on day before children return to schooolSouth Korea has reported 19 new coronavirus cases on the eve of the return to school for more than 2 million children.The majority of the new cases were in the Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been actively tracing transmissions linked to nightclubs and other entertainment venues.South Korea\u0027s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention also reported two more deaths, bringing the country\u0027s total to 269 fatalities from 11,225 cases.Wednesday will see around 2.4 million pupils return to school, and health minister Park Neung-hoo urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures.A new law has come into force in South Korea requiring people to wear masks on public transport and while using taxis.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rocket and capsule that will carry the astronauts has been built by Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, and the mission represents the final test of both.Nasa and SpaceX launch could be delayed by weatherIt will also be the first time a private company has attempted to send astronauts into space.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about this mission, which will launch at 9.30pm UK time.The mission, known as Demo-2, will allow the US to once again send humans into space.According to Nasa, this is a demonstration mission to show SpaceX\u0027s ability to ferry astronauts to the space station and back safely.It is the final major step required by SpaceX\u0027s astronaut carrier, the Crew Dragon, to get certified by Nasa\u0027s Commercial Crew Programme for more long-term manned missions to space.Mr Behnken, 48, and Mr Hurley, 53, are experienced Nasa astronauts who have been involved in testing of the Crew Dragon capsule.Mr Hurley, who was a fighter pilot in the US Marine Corps, was on the final flight of the space shuttle Atlantis in 2011 before it was discontinued.Mr Behnken was a flight test engineer with the US Air Force before joining Nasa, and has spent just over 29 days in space, which includes 37 hours of spacewalking time.He will serve as the mission\u0027s joint operations commander and take responsibility for the rendezvous, docking and undocking of the Dragon capsule, while Mr Hurley will be in charge of the launch, landing and recovery of the vehicle in his role as the Crew Dragon spacecraft commander.The two men will be wearing spacesuits designed by SpaceX with help from Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez.The Falcon 9 rocket will take off from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley strapped inside.Shortly after lift-off, the rocket will separate into what is called a first stage and a second stage.The first stage will return to a SpaceX landing ship which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida, while the second part of the rocket continue the journey with the Crew Dragon.Once in orbit, the Crew Dragon will then separate from the second stage and travel at around 17,000mph before being in a position to rendezvous, and dock, with the space station 24 hours later.Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley will test the Crew Dragon\u0027s environmental control system, the displays and controls, and the manoeuvring thrusters.They will also monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station, according to Nasa.The duo will become members of the Expedition 63 crew and perform further tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station.But the pair\u0027s main mission is to conclude the validation process that is required by Nasa to ensure the spacecraft designed to carry astronauts can operate safely.The Demo-2 mission is expected to last anything between one and four months. But Nasa said the duration of this mission would be determined by when the next commercial crew will be able to travel to the space station.The spacecraft will be capable of staying in orbit for at least 210 days.When it is time to return, the Crew Dragon will autonomously undock with Mr Behnken and Mr Hurley on board and depart the space station.Shortly after firing up its engines to re-enter the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, the spacecraft will deploy four parachutes to slow its descent and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Florida.SpaceX\u0027s recovery ship, called Go Navigator, will be waiting nearby to retrieve the duo and ferry them to Cape Canaveral.In 2010, the US started to wind down its space shuttle programme which had carried astronauts into orbit for three decades with the aim of focusing on building technology for Moon and Mars missions.Nasa asked private companies such as Space X and Boeing to design the technologies which would allow passengers to travel to space, while opting to pay Russia to send American astronauts to the space station as an interim arrangement.If Demo-2 is successful, SpaceX will be allowed to go ahead with more manned missions to the space stations as part of their 2.6 billion US dollar (£2.1 billion) contract with Nasa.Boeing also has a similar deal with the space agency, worth 4.2 billion US dollars (£3.4 billion), to send astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, although its vehicle is not expected to be ready until next year.Both Nasa and SpaceX will be hosting live streams of the events, which will begin a few hours before launch.

It will be the first time astronauts launch from Florida in nine years and a first for a private company.The manager of NASA\u0027s commercial crew program, Kathy Lueders, said everything was progressing well — at least on the ground.SpaceX gets go-ahead for Nasa astronaut launch next weekNow the only thing we need to do is figure out how to control the weather, she said Monday evening as rain continued to drench the area. We\u0027re continuing to be vigilant and careful and make sure we do this right.The Dragon\u0027s emergency escape system can kick in, if necessary, all the way to orbit. If that happens, the capsule will need relatively calm wind and seas in which to splash down.SpaceX will have at least two recovery ships deployed off Florida, and NASA will have two military cargo planes ready to take off. Additional planes will be stationed in New York and England to assist with a potential water rescue, according to Lueders.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This includes the belief that opposition to the government operate in “deep state” which works to undermine him.The conspiracy is also linked to the unfounded \u0027Pizzagate\u0027 conspiracy from 2016, which claimed that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among other members of the US establishment, was involved in an apparent child abuse ring.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesQAnon believers have had their own lawyers argue that belief in the conspiracy proves they are insane, and have climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge to spread the ideology. The FBI has stated that QAnon is a potential domestic terrorist threat. As reported by Media Matters, a not-for-profit progressive research centre, which brought the applications’ violations of Google policies to the search giant’s attention, QMAP, Q Alerts!, and Q Alerts LITE were removed from the Android store. Google’s privacy policy states that apps which have “content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks” are forbidden.The origins of the huge, bizarre \u0027QAnon\u0027 theory spreading onlineA Google spokesperson said in a statement that:  “When we find apps that violate Play policy by distributing misleading or harmful information, we remove them from the store.”It is unclear how many people downloaded the applications, or whether Google profited from any microtransactions or other payments made by people through the app. Google takes a 30 percent cut of all payments made through in-app purchases on its store. We have reached out to the company for clarification.The QAnon conspiracy theories have also interlinked with false beliefs about the coronavirus with some suggesting that the disease is a cover so Trump can secretly arrest ‘deep state agents’ while others believe that COVID-19 is part of “spiritual warfare” where only those chosen by God will not be affected.Google has had to take action against coronavirus misinformation too, working with the NHS as well as Facebook and Twitter to crack down on hoaxes.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emergency funding should go to areas with the highest rates of infection.”Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, said its authorities believed ministers had “pulled the rug from under them”, after promising they would receive “whatever it takes”.“Now it’s ‘take whatever you are given’ and it’s noticeable that it’s Labour areas that have missed out in the second tranche,” he protested.This NHS U-turn shows we must not question supporting immigrantsSignificant numbers of government’s coronavirus home tests never usedMore than a fifth of people believe coronavirus is a hoaxContact tracing app shares private date with outside firm“It is disgraceful if funding is being allocated in that partisan way, after what ministers said about putting away party-political squabbles in a time of national crisis.”In total, more than £100m was erted from councils in the bottom half of the deprivation index, when £1.6bn of emergency grants were announced in late April, according to the Labour analysis.That is the difference from the allocations to each town hall from the first £1.6bn pot, handed out in March, which did include deprivation in the weightings.The second £1.6bn tranche was awarded on a per-capita basis, raising fears in town halls – which still face an estimated £10bn black hole because of coronavirus costs – that the method will be used for future allocations.The future downgrading of deprivation was signalled in the so-called fair funding review which began under Theresa May and triggered loud protests.However, it is supposed to be on hold, until April 2022, after poorer areas that delivered Boris Johnson’s general election triumph were among those facing big cuts.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We’re providing councils with an unprecedented £3.2bn in the fairest way possible and giving them the resources to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they’re facing.“The two tranches of funding were allocated in different ways because they address different needs, but should be considered together as the true picture of this additional support.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

After a couple of hours, my wife felt a bit better. There were many critical things at work and she urged me to return in the afternoon and I did, he said. Critics say Mr Cummings was putting others in Downing Street at risk by returning there.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsHe also explained that after he then developed coronavirus symptoms last month, he drove to Durham to isolate his family when he and his wife feared they would be too unwell to care for their young son.Mr Cummings admitted what appeared to be second clear breach of the rules when he drove a 30-mile trip to the castle beauty spot, saying it was to see whether he was fit to drive back to London since he feared his sight had been affected by the virus.But he said he would not add his voice to those calling for Mr Cummings to resign, adding that “as someone who has been at the centre of media storms with a young family, I know you do make mistakes in these situations”. “I am also not convinced that politics gains much from the spectacle of scalp-hunting even though I recognise that accountability is central to our democracy and sometimes people do need to resign,” he added.Mr Hunt was among Conservative backbenchers who earlier this month criticised the government’s position on the NHS surcharge for migrant health and care workers before Boris Johnson climbed down over the issue.The chairman of the health select committee has also criticised the government by saying he was deeply concerned there were no plans to test every close contact of people who tested positive.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers added that the tweets appeared to create ision in America on coronavirus, but that they could not confirm what iniduals or groups are behind the bot accounts.“We do know that it looks like it’s a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks, but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that,” said Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, last week.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Bot Twitter accounts also discussed 100 different false narratives on the coronavirus, including conspiracies surrounding 5G technology’s connection to Covid-19. At the same time, tweets about Donald Trump’s “reopening of America” were seen to contain conspiracies. The Carnegie Mellon scientists added that current bot activity on Covid-19 was almost double that predicted, based on previous elections and natural disasters. Ms Carley continued: “Because it’s global, it’s being used by various countries and interest groups as an opportunity to meet political agendas”. Researchers described Twitter bot actions as repetitive, and above what is thought to be practically possible for humans.  “People often refer to bots when describing everything from automated account activity to iniduals who would prefer to be anonymous for personal or safety reasons, or avoid a photo because they’ve got strong privacy concerns,” said Twitter in a statement to NPR.

Russia denied allegations that it was spreading Covid-19 disinformation in the West in March, after the European Union warned in an internal document that the Kremlin wanted to “aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries”.

There is no mixing and they aren’t touching each other,” Laurent David, the headteacher of the school near Nantes, tells The Independent. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They aren’t wearing masks, but they are following the orders very well, like using hand gel.” The students – aged between five and 11 years old – are experiencing school during the time of coronavirus. ​Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?As countries hit by coronavirus start making the first steps back towards normal life, children are returning to the classroom and parents back to work.In England, schools have been told to prepare for certain years to come back from 1 June, with the aim of all primary schools students returning for a month before the summer – a move which has faced criticism from unions and councils over safety concerns. Meanwhile in France, which has also been badly-affected by Covid-19, children were allowed back to school last week.Mr David says the Ecole elementaire la Metairie started teaching pupils aged five to 11 in school again on 12 May.“In the morning, we are bringing in around half of these children,” he says. “And during the afternoon, we are looking after the children who have stayed at home by doing distance teaching.”However, he says schools were under no obligation to open, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie asked parents for their opinion first.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimilar to advice in England, schools have been told to limit class sizes to 15 children. This should be reduced to 10 for the youngest pupils in France. Although things have been going well, it gets much harder trying to get younger children to socially distance, Mr David explains. That is why lots of schools – including the preschool attached to his primary – have not yet brought children younger than five years old back into the classroom.He says other places have been bringing children back on alternate days, or even alternate weeks.“No school is working in the same way. The problem with making a six-year-old do a full day when they must stay at a table without moving around, is that becomes a very long day from them.”Mr David adds: “That makes teaching conditions very bad. Because of that, we decided to just open for mornings. It makes it easier, more effective for students, and more bearable.”However, he says it was difficult to balance the parents’ needs who were eager to return to work full time. He adds that schools have to follow health safety guidelines given to every headteacher, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie​ decided the best way they could open safely was to offer half days for now. Included in the guidelines is what to do if a child displays symptoms: call the parents straight away, and get them tested.Last Thursday, a child from the primary school near Nantes had to be taken home after falling ill and is waiting for their test results.“If it is really coronavirus, we may have to shut the school or send a class home,“We don’t have any problem doing that,” he adds.France allowed preschools and primary schools to reopen from the start of last week, with secondary schools allowed to gradually welcome students back from 18 May – although these older students must wear face masks. ‘I don’t know’: Minister admits schools reopening up in the airMinisters under pressure to scrap plans to open schools to more pupilsParents also have the right to keep their children at home if they wish.When asked what advice Mr David had for headteachers in England working to reopen schools next month, he says it is important to be “well-prepared”.“It took us two weeks to prepare properly,” he says, adding they were ready to open on the first day.“The most important thing is to make decisions as early as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Parents naturally worry their children are more vulnerable to any disease. It’s not so with coronavirus. Mums and dads should take confidence from that.And yet, defying the best impartial evidence available, the Left has terried Britain into a revolt. No, ing to school cannot be  per cent safe. What is, short of staying home forever hoping for a vaccine Meanwhile the lockdown damage to kids’ education, mental health and le chances is almost unimaginable.Corbynite NEU chief Mary Bousted cynically sneers: “It’s just descending into chaos now” before talking up the opposing claims of the so-called “Independent Sage Committee” and bemoaning the “confusion” for parents.Who caused this chaos and confusion  People like her. And this “Independent Sage Committee” is just a self-appointed club of hard-Left scientists motivated to sabotage the Brexit-backing Tories.Parents must not be taken in. The REAL Sage’s evidence is at least arrived at in good faith, not via political bias. Too many unprincipled Labour MPs are willing on these union wreckers.Aren’t they meant to be a more grown-up outfit now  So much for that.IT is good to see the PFA supporting seven gay footballers, two in the Premier League, who are too fearful of a public backlash to come out.We totally sympathise.But Covid gives them a unique breathing space to do so.There will be no barracking in empty stadiums. Social media can be ignored. And . per cent of the public won’t care or will applaud their courage.By the time football s in full, their sexuality will be old news — and any abusive bigot will get short shrt.Homophobia will be history one day.

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands. Our national security lies in ours.We all hope China will make the necessary reforms and take the right path.But hope is not a good basis for foreign policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By doing this he has left himself open to claims that he behaves asthere is one law for him and one law for the rest of us.But his case is very dferent to those of Professor Neil Ferguson and Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, who both resigned after breaking lockdown.Professor Ferguson went to visit his married lover and Dr Calderwood enjoyed a break at her holiday home.Mr Cummings travelled to isolate himself and ensure the protection of his young son.

He has been proved right.“The problem with epidemiologists is that they feel their job is to frighten people into lockdown,” says Levitt. “I think lockdown saved no lives.”Indeed, this outbreak of ­coronavirus does not even rate officially as an epidemic.Just as many died in  from severe winter flu. Back then, images of patients ­queuing on hospital trolleys or parked in ­ambulances aroused routine media interest.Lockdown was never even considered.All deaths are tragic for those who go before their time.Butthere is another ­outbreak this winter, would we shut down the entire economy again  No way.So why did we take such draconian action this time It was to save the NHS, which had been left ­unprepared by its managers.We’ve now done that. Hospitals are back to normal. Death rates are falling. There is no sign of a second wave, whether we lt lockdown or not.The NHS has coped brilliantly thanks to frontline staff, not its leaden-footed, box­ticking bureaucratic bosses.Our Thursday night salutes have done their job and — as their cheerleader suggests — should be wound up this week.This freak ten-week spring Bank Holiday is over.It’s time for classrooms to resume, shops to reopen and pubs and theatres to begin cheering us up again.Let’s keep washing our hands and elbow bumping, but two-metre distancing is just another form of lockdown.Let’s make it one metre, as the World Health Organisation suggests.Britain will bounce back swtly in a V-shaped recovery — rather than crashing ­vertically over the edge of that wretched clf.DEFIANT Boris Johnson did more than simply ride to the rescue of embattled Dominic Cummings yesterday.

Plenty in the private sector do too.Many parents, despite official scientic advice saying it is safe, say they will refuse totheir kids to school even though the PM has announced the first welcome reopenings on June  .Most people think the economy will right itself in a year or two and few seem bothered.They are more fixated on the furore over whether Dominic Cummings bent the lockdown rules to look after his child than with the looming catastrophe unless they are soon lted.This suicidal delusion is the result of a highly effective Government campaign about the Covid- threat, combined with generous bailouts, a promise of no new austerity and some great weather.Millions, including many Sun readers, have worked through the crisis. Millions more are itching to go back.Too many others, though, have been lulled into a disastrous  sense of security.We face an unprecedented recession.

So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places.

They were alone in the house.After very briefly telling some officials in No. what had happened, I immediately left the building, ran to a car and drove home. This was reported by the media at the time who saw me run out of No. . After a couple of hours, my we felt a bit better. There were many critical things at work and she urged me toin the afternoon and I did.That evening, I ed home and discussed the situation with my we. She was ill. She might have Covid, though she did not have a cough or a fever. At this point, most of those who I work with most closely, including the prime minister himself and others who sit within  feet of me every day, either had had symptoms and had ed to work or were absent with symptoms. I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.I had a few conflicting thoughts in my mind. First, I was worried thatmy we and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child and exposed themselves to Covid. My we had felt on the edge of not being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier. I was thinking, whatthe same or worse happens to me  Theres nobody here that I can reasonably ask to help. The regulations make clear, I believe the risks to the health of a small child were an exceptional situation, and I had a way of dealing with this that minimised risk to others.Second, I thought thatI did not develop symptoms, then I might be able toto work to help deal with the crisis. There were ongoing discussions about testing government staff in order to keep people like me working rather than isolating. At this point, on the Friday, advisers such as myself had not been included in the list of who were tested. But it was possible that this might change the following week. Therefore, I thought that after testing negative, I could continue working.In fact, this did not change and special advisers were not tested and I have never been tested. Third, there had been numerous  stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid. In particular, there were stories suggesting that I had opposed lockdown and even then I did not care about many deaths. For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning. The truth is, that I had argued for lockdown. I did not oppose it. But these stories had created a very bad atmosphere around my home. I was subject to threats of violence. People came to my house shouting threats.There were posts on social media, encouraging attacks. There were many media reports on TV showing pictures of my house. I was also worried that given the severity of this emergency, this situation would get worse. And I was worried about the possibility of leaving my we and child at home all day and off into the night while I worked in No.. I thought the best thing to do in all the circumstances was to drive to an isolated cottage on my fathers farm. At this farm, my parents live in one house.My sister and her two children live in another house, and there was a separate cottage roughly  metres away from either of them. My tentative conclusion on the Friday evening was this:we are both unable to look after our child, then my sister or nieces can look after him. My nieces are  and . They are old enough to look after him, but also young enough to be in the safest category. And they had extremely kindly volunteered to do soneeded.But, I thought,I do not develop symptoms and there is a testing regime in place at work, I couldto workI tested negative. In that situation, I could leave my we and child behind in a safe place, safe in the form of support from family for shopping in emergencies, safe in the sense of being away from home which had become a target and also safe for everybody  because they were completely isolated on a farm and could not infect anybody.Contrary to some media reports, there are no neighbours in the normal sense of the word. The nearest other homes are roughly half a mile away. So in this scenario, I thought that they could stay there for a few weeks. I could go back to work, help colleagues and everybody, including the general public, would be safe.I did not ask the prime minister about this decision. He was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with. Everyday, I have to exercise my judgement about things like this and decide what to discuss with him. I thought I would speak to him when the situation claried over coming days, including whether I had symptoms and whether there were tests available.Arguably, this was a mistake, and I understand that some will say that I shouldve spoken to the prime minister before deciding what to do. So I drove the three of us up to Durham last night, arriving roughly at midnight. I did not stop on the way. When I worked the next morning, Saturday the th of March, I was in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever.Clearly, I could notto work any time soon. For a day or two, we were both ill. I was in bed. My we was ill, but not ill enough that she needed emergency help. I got worse. She got better. During the night of Thursday, the nd of April, my child woke up. He threw up and had a bad fever. He was very distressed. We took medical advice which was to call . An ambulance was sent, they assessed my child and said he must go to hospital.I could barely stand up. My we went with him in the ambulance. I stayed at home. He stayed the night in the hospital. In the morning, my we called to say that he had recovered, seemed back to normal. Doctors had tested him for Covid and said that they shouldhome. There were no taxis. I drove to the hospital, picked them up, then ed home.I did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody at any point on this short trip. The hospitals, I dont know what, roughly five miles or something away two miles, three miles four miles, something like that. A few days later, the hospital said that he tested negative. After I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house.At one point the three of us walked into woods owned by my father, next to the cottage that I was staying in. Some people saw us in these woods from a distance, but we had no interaction with them. We had not left the property. We were on private land. By Saturday, the th of April, I was still feeling weak and exhausted. But other than that, I had no Covid symptoms. I thought that Id be able toto work the following week, possibly part time.It was obvious that the situation was extremely serious. The Prime Minister had been gravely ill. Colleagues were dealing with huge problems and many were ill or isolating. I felt like I ought toto workpossible, given I was now recovering in order to relieve the intense strain at No. . That Saturday, I sought expert medical advice. I explained our familys symptoms and all the timings, and I askedit was safe toto work on Monday, Tuesday, seek child care and so on. I was told that it was safe and I couldto work and seek childcare.On Sunday  April,  days after I had first displayed symptoms, I decided toto work. My we was very worried, particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She didnt want to risk a nearly -mile drive with our child, given how ill I had been. We agreed that we should go for a short drive to seeI could drive safely. We drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town.We did not visit the castle. We did not walk around the town. We parked by a river. My we and I discussed the situation. We agreed that I could drive safely, we should turn around, go home. I felt a bit sick. We walked about  to  metres from the car to the river bank nearby. We sat there for about  minutes. We had no interactions with anybody. I felt better. We ed the car. An elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My we wished him Happy Easter from a distance, but we had no other interaction.We headed home. On the way home, our child needed the toilet. He was in the back seat of the car. We pulled over to the side of the road, my we and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road. They were briefly outside. I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit and then I got out of the car, went outside. We were briefly in the woods. We saw some people at a distance. But at no point did we break any social distancing rules. We then got back in the car and went home.We agreed thatI continued to improve then the next day, we shouldto London and I would go back to work. We ed to London on the evening of Monday  April, Easter Monday. I went back to work in No.  the next morning. At no point between arriving and leaving Durham did any of the three of us enter my parents house or my sisters house. Our only exchanges were shouted conversations at a distance. My sister shopped for us and left everything outside.In the last few days, there have been many media reports that I ed to Durham after  April. All these stories are . There is a particular report that I ed there on  April. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . And local CCTV,it exists, would also prove that Im telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.During this two-week period, my mothers brother died with Covid. There are media reports that this had some influence on my behaviour. These reports . This private matter did not affect my movements. None of us saw him. None of us attended his funeral. In this very complex situation, I tried to exercise my judgement the best I could.I believe that in all circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in No. and the public interest in effective government to which I could contribute.I was involved in decisions affecting millions of people, and I thought that I should try to help as much as I could do. I can understand that some people will argue that I should have stayed at my home in London throughout.I understand these views. I know the intense hardship and sacrice that the entire country has had to go through. However, I respectfully disagree. The legal rules inevitably do not cover all circumstances, including those that I found myself in. I thought and I think today that the rules, including those regarding small children in extreme circumstances, allowed me to exercise my judgement about the situation I found myself in, including the way that my London home had become a target and all the complexity of the situation.I accept, of course, that there is room for reasonable disagreement about this. I could also understand some people think I should not have driven at all anywhere.But I had taken medical expert medical advice. It was  days after symptoms. Id been told that I couldto work and employ childcare. I think it was reasonable and sensible to make a short journey before embarking on a five-hour drive to see whether I was in a fit state to do this. The alternative was to stay in Durham rather than going back to work and contributing to the governments efforts. I believe I made the right judgment, though I can understand that others may disagree with that.Ive explained all of the above to the Prime Minister. At some point during the first week where we were both sick and in bed, I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly, given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail. I did not make my movements public at the time because my London home was already a target. I did not believe that I was obliged to make my parents and my sisters home a target for harassment as well.I understand that millions of people have seen media coverage of this issue. I know that millions have endured awful hardship, including personal tragedies, over the past few months, and people are suffering every day. And I know the British people hate the idea of unfairness. I wanted to explain what I thought, what I did and why, over this period, because I think that people like me who helped to make the rules should be accountable for their actions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The audience was tobacco buyers and not consumers.Theres a greater risk of progressing to regular smoking and nicotine dependence for those who start on menthols compared to those puffing on plain versions.Young people are more likely to get hooked as menthol makes it easier to inhale the smoke into the lungs by creating a sweeter, milder, or “colder” smoke and by reducing its harshness.These flavoured fags have been banned in the UK under EU laws which still apply during the Brexit transition.The legislation stems from the EU Tobacco Products Directive .This tough rule has been transposed into UK law, and will remain in force after the end of the transition period for leaving the EU comes to an end on December , .The products are being sold under the “menthol reimagined logo” and could take in some of the revenue from the £. billion-a-year UK market.An online training course seen by The Sun shows how JTI is marketing the new products.Sterling New Superkings Green are the new products and are the same as Sterling Superkings Green, while the latest version from Benson  Hedges is Benson  Hedges New Superkings Green, which had been Benson  Hedges Superkings Blue Dual.The ban was supposed to have been on cigarettes with a characterising flavour such as menthol products, the new blend however smells and tastes like menthol, but does not actually contain it.Speaking to the Daily Mail, Conservative MP Rob Blackman said the company was “cynically trying to circumvent a very sensible ban on cigarettes which are intended to make you quickly addicted to nicotine and a customer for le.“There are literally thousands of young people who get addicted to nicotine through menthol cigarettes. That was the point of the ban.

catching the virus.But Mr Hancock now says that stockpiles are starting to be built up again, and enough equipment is in the bag to meet future demand.The final test is that the government and medical professionals must be certain that there will not be a risk of a second wave of infection, similar to that in Germany.Professor Van-Tam said on May : We have to be confident that the adjustments we contemplate are not going to risk a second peak of infections and this is really a matter of deep scientic discussion.Its one we are keeping under detailed scientic review as the days and weeks go by.Terried NHS staff had told how they had to wear scuba masks, bin bags, kitchen aprons and even holding their breath to treat patients thanks to the utter shambles of the PPE crisis.Nurses and doctors also use swim and ski goggles, out-of-date masks and put clinical waste bags on their heads and feet as they risk their lives to help virus victims.Nearly half of doctors have had to find their own protective equipment or rely on donations, says a survey by the British Medical Association.One health worker said the PPE shortage was an utter shambles from start to finish.But over time production has been ramped up and hospitals are now starting to build up stocks again. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg

It has a national component.But it has a very important local component as well which needs to reflect the things that you described the special characteristics of dferent parts of the country.Mr Hancock said adherence to the rules would be crucial to the contact tracing system and allowing the nation to ease the lockdown.He said: If youre phoned up and asked to self isolate, even though youre perfectly healthy... then its your civic duty to then self isolate for yourself, for your community for your family.We all need to come together to do this.That will then in turn, allow us to lt some of the measures that currently are blanket measures across the whole of society, and have to be blanket measures until we have the the NHS test and trace system up and running, and in place, so it is very important.The news comes as the Government continues to be embroiled in a row over the PMs senior advisor Dominic Cummings, who drove to Durham and back while self-isolating.But the Health Secretary was hopeful this evening - suggesting the Government had now met four out of five of its crucial tests for lting lockdown. To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month.

The renovation would include structural work, electrics, and painting and decorating.The building is Grade II listed which means someone moving in would only be able to full refurbish it at the moment, although the estate agent selling it did say extending it might be possible.When renovated it could make a spacious family home although there is a lot to do including rewiring, replumbing, and replastering.In the bathroom, there is an original toilet cistern and freestanding bath - now a sought-after addition to most modern homes.The house currently has a reception hall leading to a big sitting room, kitchen, and three further reception rooms, which could be used as a good sized-dining room, a snug or playroom, and a study or utility room.Stuart Sillars from BTF Partnership, who are selling the property, said someone buying the property could easily spend £, on doing it up, with similar properties in good order making £, to , in the area.Upstairs there are three good-sized bedrooms and a family bathroom.It has gardens to the back of the house and barn, with parking areas, and further neighbouring land that might be up for sale separately.The farmhouse is a short drive from the town of Faversham, which is just under six miles away.From Faversham station, central London can be reached in just over an hour.While it may sound like a lot of work, weve seen similar properties for sale which have required total renovations.These include a six-bed Doncaster house for sale last year for £, which needed a lot of work to make it habitable.While one keen DIY-fan added £, to his property in  days by installing a kitchen.There is an adjoining barn which has planning permission to be converted into another three-bedroom home, although this has already been sold under offer. Mr Sillars added: This is a very traditional and rural Kent farmhouse which is now ready for updating for modern living and it presents a fantastic opportunity for someone looking for a development project.This is a beautul part of the North Kent Downs and the house will once again make a fantastic family home for the future.A popular way to sell a property is via an online raffle, one couple have spent two years renovating a Welsh cottage worth £, and have now put it on sale via raffle tickets for £ each.New rules are now in place for house viewings, including estate agents giving health screenings.Right now stunning mansions are the most viewed properties online.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re helping to tackle loneliness and isolation. You’re providing meals to people that cannot leave home. You’re helping fund projects that support physical and mental health in communities across the entire nation.We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.But thanks to you, £ million of funding from The National Lottery is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and good causes. This vital funding has helped hundreds of key projects continue to offer support to people in our communities.  One of those to benefit is Northern Ireland’s Macular Society, which helps people struggling with their sight due to macular degeneration. They provide peer support, counselling, help, advice and many other services to members. The charity received an additional £, grant from The National Lottery to adapt and increase support for people remotely during lockdown. Elaine Orwinhas been involved with the charity for  years. The -year-old said: Macular disease affects your physical health. You often can’t drive so lose your independence, but our group of  members is a leline. We used to meet monthly, but since lockdown it’s fortnightly virtual meetings, and I’ve also referred people for phone counselling. The contact we have had is really precious.  The charity is planning to launch a befriending service and webinars, and they’ve also run a Tech Talk project, helping members to use computers and even just access audio description on their TVs. It’s really important for us to thank National Lottery players, as without them none of this would be possible. Another project to receive funding is Leicester’s Emerald Centre, which supports vulnerable people of all ages, including elderly residents and those with disabilities, in a deprived area of the city.  Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us. Merthyr Tydfil’s Twyn Community Hubhas also received support, with a £, grant from The National Lottery to expand their daily hot meals and weekly hamper project during lockdown. The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

So thanks to Downing Street for taking me back to my childhood and putting on Carry On Bullsh*tting. That sketch about testing your eyes for a long drive by going for a longish one with your four-year-old in the car was cracking. But the longer this excruciating exhibition of detachedness from reality went on, the less funny it was. The interview was a Prince Andrew-style car crash. And the sight of Cummings sucking in all the political oxygen due to breaking lockdown rules we had all been sticking to, on a day when we were waiting to hear from the Prime Minister when we could start to dismantle them, was a national disgrace. His contempt for the Little People was evident from the off when he turned up more than half an hour late. It continued when he kept answering questions by saying “with great respect” when his face was sneering at the reporter he was supposedly respecting. The haughty disdain continued when he read out what sounded like an Enid Blyton story called Three Go For A Pee In The Woods. It read like a litany of excuses we’ve all heard given in school as teachers howled in disbelief.  Any moment I expected him to say he only drove to Durham because the cat peed on his satnav. It was a tale in which he admitted multiple breaches of rules he helped draw up but he could not possibly apologise because it was all the media’s fault. Throughout, I was recalling the many times Tony Blair’s senior adviser, Alastair Campbell, and Gordon Brown’s, Charlie Whelan, had said to me that once you become the story you have to go.

Robin Lees, a retired Chemistry teacher from County Durham, said thought he had spotted Mr Cummings near his home. He told BBC Radio Newcastle: Just by what he looks like in the press, I had obviously seen him. You know, I take an interest in the news, I look at the BBC website every day, that sort of thing. I take an interesting in politics, also, so I know what he looks like, and this person did look strikingly like him. He had a we and child with him, so. Asked what he thought about seeing him  miles from London, he said: I thought it was slightly strange. Thataposs why I just went home and looked up online and realised, you know. I wouldnapost have known what the family looked like. I found out he had a son the sort of age the child seemed to be. So I thought, that must be him. He added: And I remembered the numberplate, because it was easy to remember, and just wrote it down. I looked it up and found out it wasnapost from County Durham, I thought somebody might have bought it second hand.  When the news broke, Mr Lees said, he thought Well, goodness me, that must be the person I saw, then. And then there were these stories in the press saying that heaposd been there, and other people denying it and saying he was just stuck in his house all the time. So I just looked up online to see the history and saw that those days fitted with the time he was supposed to be in County Durham. He contacted thenewspaper to confirm the numberplate he had written down matched Mr Cummingsapos numberplate - which it did. He added: I didnapost do very much , and loads of people sort of appeared at my door and I just told them the same story, thataposs all.

The Cabinet Office Minister insisted he, like Boris Johnsonaposs aide Dominic Cummings, had got behind the wheel to seehis eyes were good enough for a long journey. Mr Cummings prompted incredulity when he tried to explain a -mile round trip to a beauty spot by saying he wanted to test his eyesight before a -mile journey from Durham to London. But Mr Gove, who as Education Secretary from  was Mr Cummingsapos boss, suggested he too had taken the unusual step of testing his eyesight through driving. Asked on LBChe would have gone on a -mile round trip to test your eyesight , Mr Gove replied: I have, on occasions in the past, driven with my we in order to make sure, whataposs the right way of putting it …   Mr Gove later admitted the point he was seeking to make was that he was not an authority on driving as someone who took seven attempts to pass their driving test”. He added: “Iaposm not going to pass judgement on other peopleaposs driving. Meanwhile, a former top officer said Mr Cummings would have been turned back by policehe had been caught on his -mile journey from London to Durham. Ex-Greater Manchester Police chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said Boris Johnsonaposs chief aide would have been sent back to the capitalan officer had stopped him on his drive north. He told the BBC: I think at that point in terms of what was the understanding of the regulations and the Government messaging I think it may well be that absolutely heaposd have been turned back, as many other people were turned back from things that they were doing. Critics of Mr Cummings have warned his actions have undermined government attempts to get people to stick by the rules. Sir Peter feared it was dficult to see the policeaposs role in controlling lockdown – particularly as pictures showed thousands of lockdown-weary families hitting beaches and beauty spots as the sun blazed over the bank holiday weekend. Thereaposs a lot of confusion and it feels like thereaposs quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and whataposs happening on the street,” he warned.

Mr Cummings is under pressure to resign after the Mirror revealed he, his we and child had travelled  miles from his London home - while his we had coronavirus symptoms - to stay in a house owned by his parents in Durham. The government claimed Mr Cummings and his family isolated for  days while relatives brought him supplies. But ministers have refused to deny claims he left that house to go on a trip to Barnard Castle  miles away around the end of his -day isolation. At the time, Brits were advised not to drive long distances and to only take a walk, bike ride or cycleleaving the house for exercise. Boris Johnson last night defended Mr Cummingsapos breach of the advice to stay at home and not travel, especiallysuffering from the virus. He claimed the aide followed the instincts of every father and every parent… and I do not mark him down for that”. But a string of Tory backbenchers are now turning on the strategy chief, urging him to quit. Here are all the Tory MPs who are calling for Dominic Cummings to resign so far. What are your thoughts on the controversy  Email webnews@mirror Peter Aldous At a time when the Country must move on to the next stage of defeating Covid-, of getting back to work whilst ensuring that there is not a second peak, there must be no distraction from this challenge. The Government should recognise what families have gone through and what people are thinking and saying. It is thus important that Dominic Cummings should now stand down. Steve Baker Enough is enough. I and others saved him once before when he was driving Vote Leave to implosion. Not today. Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the Government, the Prime Minister, our institutions or the Conservative Party. Time is up. It is time for Dom to resign so Boris can govern within the conventions and norms which will see us through. It is time to get competing expert advice, decent software and better decisions, end the lockdown and start a long, hard recovery.  Harriet Baldwin   Former minister Harriett Baldwin said: While I have every human sympathy with Dominic Cummings, I think there is a higher bar for members of the Government. If the Government wants people to follow the public health advice in order to protect our NHS and save lives, then members of the Government giving that advice, including the Prime Ministeraposs adviser, need to follow it too. The Government relies on moral authority to receive the consent of the people to such draconian reductions in their freedoms. Therefore, for the sake of future adherence to public health guidelines, I believe he should resign. Peter Bone The Tory Brexiteer said Mr Cummings has to go because he broke the rules and has not apologised. Speaking on Nigel Farageaposs show on LBC, he said: When an adviser becomes the story, the adviser has to go. Boris Johnson can carry on without Dominic Cummingshe goes but it will be hardhe stays. Elliot Colburn The Conservative MP for Carshalton and Wallington, said he had written to the Prime Minister calling for Dominic Cummings to resign. In his letter to Boris Johnson, Mr Colburn wrote: I have received more emails on this than on any other issue since being elected - many hundreds of messages from concerned constituents - and I join them in that view. I feel it necessary to stress the importance of continued public trust and engagement with the measures being taken to overcome this crisis.At this critical time, as we start to relax some of the measures we have asked people to live with for many weeks now, we must ensure the public feel willing and able to continue social distancing and engage positively with those that continue to be in place to avoid a second spike.I fear this could undermine that effort. Damian Collins Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt. The government would be better without him.  Philip Davies It is admirable of the Prime Minister to be loyal to his staff and to seek to defend and support those who work for him. Dominic Cummings should now repay that loyalty to the Prime Minister by resigning his position for the good of the Prime Minister, the government and the country. Jackie Doyle-Price  The Tory MP for Thurrock posted on her Facebook page.She said: I have received a number of representation regarding the behaviour of Dominic Cummings and thought I should state my position. The Government has been very clear in its message that we have had to Stay Home and Save lives.For some of us that instruction has come at great personal cost. Some people have lost their livelihoods. Some people have lost loved ones and been unable to say goodbye. In making real sacrices in order to obey the Government’ instructions it is quite understandable that there is anger that Government figures have not done the same.When a Government is tainted with a ‘do as I say, not as I do’ attitude to the public, it loses its moral authority. Sir Roger Gale While as a father and as a grandfather I fully appreciate Mr Cummings’ desire to protect his child. There cannot be one law for the Prime Minister’s staff and another for everyone . He has sent out completely the wrong message and his position is no longer tenable. James Gray Unless and until he can justy what he did, he should face the consequences of it and give up his role as a government adviser. Having him continuing at the heart of government undermines our credibility and the strength of our message.” Robert Goodwill Iaposve been contacted by over  constituents who, with one or two exceptions, have been critical of Mr Cummings and his statement yesterday has done nothing to convince them otherwise.I think that the best way for the Prime Minister, who Iaposm a massive fan of, to show heaposs in charge of the situation is to relieve himself of Mr Cummingsapos services. Stephen Hammond An e-mail he apparently wrote to a constituent states: It is clear that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we all were instructed to follow. I find his explanation unconvincing. I am angry that so many have sacriced so much for public safety and yet this man has decided his interpretation of doing the right thing overrode the clear instruction of Stay at Home. His selfish act has undermined our, and my, efforts to keep Wimbledon safe. Mr Cummings should of course have resigned as any honourable person would have done and not put everyone  in this wholly invidious position. I cannot defend the indefensible and I have no intention of doing so. I have always tried to do the best thing for Wimbledon and it is now served by Mr Cummings leaving his role. Mark Harper In these circumstances, as an absolute minimum, an apology should have been made and level of regret expressed. I am disappointed Mr Cummings did neither. ... I would expect an adviser who had damaged the credibility of the Governmentaposs central message so badly and had become the story to consider their position. Mr Cummings should have offered to resign, and the Prime Minister should have accepted his resignation. Simon Hoare With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the Government’s reputation he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. It’s his cavalier “I don’t care I’m cleverer than you” tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM Govt  I don’t like that Andrew Jones The Harrogate Advertiser reported he wrote to constituents saying: “It seems clear to me that Mr Cummings has broken the guidelines which we were and are all expected to follow. For that reason I think that he should resign andhe does not do so then he should be dismissed.” Simon Jupp Although I believe his actions were motivated by a father’s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances,placed in the same situation I wouldn’t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position. Tim Loughton Told the BBC the defence of Mr Cummings is deeply damaging and is seriously compromising the governmentaposs public health advice. Saying heaposs been swamped by e-mails he condemned Boris Johnson, telling the BBC: What I wanted to hear was a proper justication of why what Dominic Cummings did was fine. “I fear I didn’t get that and what’s more worrying is my constituents didn’t get that.” Paul Maynard He said he shared peopleaposs dismay at the response, adding: It is a classic case of aposdo as I say, not as I doapos - and it is not ashe was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up. It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable. Jason McCartney He said while it was important for people to show compassion during the crisis, Mr Cummings had to go because the perceived hypocrisy of the rule makers potentially threatens the success of any future measures under a second wave of the coronavirus. We must have confidence that we are doing the right things for the right reasons and that we are all truly in it together. For that reason I believe Mr Cummingsapos position is now untenable, Mr McCartney said in a Facebook post. Stephen Metcalfe Caroline Nokes I made my views clear to my whip yesterday. There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made dficult sacrices over the course of the last  weeks. Mark Pawsey On the basis of what I heard, it is clear that while he believed he was acting within the letter of the law, he did the wrong thing and acted very much against the spirit of the lockdown rules. ... As such, I believe that it is wrong that Mr Cummings remains in an important post in Government. I had hoped he that would tender his resignation of his own accord. As he has failed to do so, I now believe it is right for the Prime Minister to ask for his resignation. This is a position that I have communicated to my colleagues within the Conservative Party and the Government. His letter to constituents Andrew Percy Laurence Robertson Indeed, like many others, I have found the rules to be personally heart-wrenching. On th May, my father died of Coronavirus and the pain and guilt of my being unable to visit him as he fought for his le will haunt me for the rest of my days. I wouldnapost wish this situation on anyone, but I know that many of my constituents have suffered in the same or similar ways. However we are fighting against a world-wide pandemic and really do need to be all in this together. I have, therefore, spent yesterday and today urging the Prime Minister and all those closely connected to him, to recognise the strength of feeling which exists on this issue and to dismiss Mr Cummings without further delay. For now, I will not be playing this matter out in public, but am working on the issue through the effective channels which exist. Douglas Ross I have constituents who didnapost get to say goodbye to loved ones, families who could not mourn together, people who didnapost visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior advisor to the government was right. Alec Shelbrooke John Stevenson Carlisle and the country have sacriced a lot over the last few weeks. People in positions of power have added responsibility-Mr Cummings holds such a position. Therefore in my view in the interests of the country Mr Cummings should resign. Bob Stewart On the face of it Mr Cummings seems to have been out of line to break lockdown instructions. Personally, I felt rather ashamed as the rest of us are all bidden to obey the rules and those directives appear to have been broken by him. Clearly there is some dispute... The truth is that, whether Mr Cummings broke or didnapost do the right thing, he certainly destroyed the spirit of the rules by what he did. It will make it very dficult for us, the rest of the population, to accept the largely voluntary restraints we have lived under for  weeks. I apologise for that because those rules remain in place and we should all still abide by them. I am afraid I believe his position is thus untenable. Julian Sturdy I donapost think this can go on much longer. It is damaging the Governmentaposs reputation. You canapost have one rule for Government advisers and one for everyone . His future does seem to look more and more untenable moving forward. The Prime Minister needs to clary Mr Cummingsapos position in a statement as soon as possible. Robert Syms The Poole MP tweeted: The Government has to explain test, track and trace and the next phase of lting lockdown next week. Whatever the merits of a Government adviser, they should never be the story or it detracts from the central message which is to get us out of this crisis. The adviser should go. Martin Vickers David Warburton Tory MP David Warburton said his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, and the Dominic Cummings story gives an impression of “double standards”. He told BBC Breakfast: “People have made sacrices... Instinct hasn’t really been part of it. He added: “Ideally,he broke the rules then he obviously should be subject to the same kind of consequences as anybody  who broke the rules... To me, enough is really enough, I think he’s damaging the Government and the country that he’s supposed to be serving.” Craig Whittaker I totally agree that Dominic Cummings position is untenable. Iaposm sure he took the decision in the best interests of his family but like every decision we take we also have to take responsibility for those decisions. You cannot advise the nation one thing then do the opposite. William Wragg We cannot throw away valuable public  political good will any longer. It’s humiliating  degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an advisor. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation. Jeremy WrightConservative former attorney general Jeremy Wright wrote on his website that it could be argued that Mr Cummings did not technically breach the lockdown laws, although he did call for further explanation. However, in determining what should happen now, technical compliance cannot be the only consideration, he continued. Our continued success in combating the virus may well rely on more of that and Mr Cummingsapos actions and his justication of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively. This is more important than the position of any inidual in Downing Street and therefore, fairly or unfairly, I have concluded that it would be better for Mr Cummings to leave his position at Downing Street. Other senior figures calling for him to go Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw MPs whoaposve voiced criticism but not explicitly called for him to go yet: Lee Anderson I will not accept trial by media when a persons whole future is at stake.... I suspect there will be a few more twists to this story over the next few days and I reserve judgement until I have all the facts. We cannot have one rule for one and another rule for the rest of us. Cummings should have a chance to come back on this as it is clear that he travelled to another house to live with his family but it is not clearhe came into contact with other members of his family or been out and about as suggested. If its the latter then he should go. Tracey Crouch The ex-minister Tracey Crouch posted on Facebook: “I am not sure I have felt, in my ten years as an MP, so frustrated, cross, confused or impotent as I do now.” She added: “I have had to tell people they can’t go to funerals, say goodbye to the ones they love, see the family newborns that they will grow to love, visit the graves of parents, siblings or worse, children, and visit friends who are dying. “Should Dominic resign or be sacked  This is not for me to say and I don’t recall calling for anyone in any party to go over mistakes.” Ms Crouch continued: “I am pretty peed off though... [it] leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.” George Freeman Demanded a public apology, adding: I fear this Cummings lockdown truancy saga will mark the end of public trust in and respect for the calls for unity in sacrice from Downing Street. Which in turn will undermine virus control. Meaning an extended lockdown  more sacrice  suffering.

The £ bill works out at £. a day – just p more than a large Big Mac meal in McDonald’s. The bargain end-terrace property has been listed to let in the proud former mining village of Horden, Co Durham. Experts believe it is the cheapest family home to rent in the UK for many years. The “spacious” double-glazed property, just a short stroll from a beach and near two schools, features two double bedrooms, fitted bathroom and two reception rooms.The s home is a whopping  per cent cheaper than the average £,-a-month cost of a two-bed property in London’s exclusive Mayfair. But some locals issued a warning to would-be tenants that certain streets in the village were plagued with Asbo yobs. Former primary school teacher Doug Langan, , said: “There is a lot to like about Horden. There’s a great community spirit and it’s right on the coast.” But he added of the area where the house stands: “Some of the houses are owned by retired miners who have been there  years but others have gone to rack and ruin. £ is cheap but you will get what you pay for.”Fth Street, just  yards from Durham’s Heritage Coast, has proved a hit with ­families searching for a budget base. The low-cost let could even be popular with commuters in larger towns able to work from home and looking to save a fortune.

The talented toddler taught himself to read books by two and can write the English, Greek and Arabic alphabet - despite having no Greek or Arabic heritage. Mum Michelle Nelson, , said “he just loves language” and has already asked for books of the Russian alphabet. With a reading age of seven years ten months and maths skills usually seen in the average six-and-a-half-year-old, his Mensa acceptance letter arrived last month. Ms Nelson, a secondary school teacher, said: “Izaak is my only child so going through the process of parenting I was shocked that one day he could just read. “It was more from being outside with him and him reading signs on the bus and the underground, reading names of stations and reading instructions on posters like ‘please sit down take a seat. “People were looking at him and asking whether he was at school because they couldn’t believe a child that young could read. “Every time I walk out the house someone compliments him.”  Izaak can also count to ten in Spanish, knows all the planets in order, and spends time putting alphabet blocks by corresponding items, such as ‘A’ next to his ‘aquarium.’ Ms Nelson, from Cheshunt, Herts, added: “I had to tell the nursery [about his Arabic] - they thought he was writing nonsense! “They couldn’t believe it because none of them know that alphabet.” Izaak took the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test with educational psychologist Dr Peter Congdon.  Dr Congdon recommended he gets tested again in two to four years to see how his IQ improves. His report described Izaak as ‘a child of very superior general intelligence and scholastic attainments to match.’ Because Mensa’s tests can not be applied to under -year-olds, they must take an independent assessment beforehand as prior evidence for the application.

A study of , college and sixth-form pupils found concerns around finances, family and their future in general have led to four in  changing their mind about their upcoming higher education. Prior to lockdown,  per cent of these had planned to go to university but are now looking at other options, while a tenth are questioning their choice to take a gap year. More than one in  are also re-evaluating whether they should stick with their decision to defer their education. The study, by MyUniChoices, found  per cent of those who have changed their minds are putting this down to feeling uncertain about the economy. Almost one in five are looking to change their plans to be closer to family while  per cent are concerned about their personal finances. But three in  simply canapost think about their future when things are so ambiguous and more than half are anxious about committing to plans during the current crisis. The findings come after it was revealed that universities are facing a £ million loss in tuition fees. Dr Charles Johnson, chief psychometrics advisor for MyUniChoices, said: In common with most other people, young people are suffering from a huge degree of uncertainty about the future and this is greatly affecting their immediate plans for what to do after leaving school. Those choosing to go to university recognise they are making a choice which will shape their lives for more than just the years that they study, so making the right choice matters. Itaposs vital that when students choose to go away, they do so with confidence that the time they will spend studying will be in a course and an environment which help them grow and thrive. Whether they plan to go away this year or next, it is only right that students pause, take stock and check that the course they want to do is the one which is right for them. Taking a small amount of time to reflect and reassess now is the best way of avoiding making the wrong choice which can be costly from a financial, career and mental health perspective. The research also found more than a third of students are uncertain about employment opportunities and  per cent admitted they donapost know what to do with their le now. While  per cent agreed they intend to go into higher education at some stage,  per cent of those are unsure whether they will start in September. And an eighth have already changed the year they will enrol. But those who do not plan to go to university at all put this down to low confidence, finance issues and not feeling ready. Better support and information around funding, higher education options and knowing which course best suits their interests and strengths would help them change their minds. It also emerged  per cent of school leavers are worried about how their predicted grades will impact their future prospects and  per cent think itaposs unfair that they donapost get to sit their exams.

Beaches and beauty spots were packed on Bank Holiday Monday and popular again on Tuesday have fuelled concerns that weeks of progress could be undone by a second wave of Covid-. And it is feared Boris Johnsonaposs decision to back Dominic Cummingsapos lockdown trip to Durham could undermine the Governmentaposs safety messages and lead to people choosing to flout the rules. As pictures show packed coastal and beauty spots where social distancing was a challenge, Britons are being reminded to use common sense and do their part to prevent the virusapos spread.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening.Health chiefs, councils and police forces have said that a majority of people are complying with the emergency laws and guidelines as more fine weather tempts Britons outside. While lockdown restrictions continue to be eased, crowds flocked to beauty spots on Bank Holiday Monday, raising concerns in some areas. Beaches and beauty spots were busy again on Tuesday. Waverley Borough Council in Surrey issued a warning to those visiting the village of Frensham, tweeting: Please be aware that the car park is filling up quickly and it is very busy so social distancing will be hard.On Monday, thousands of people flocked to beaches in places such as Brighton, Southend and Bournemouth, where the local council reminded people there were other less busy but equally lovely open spaces to enjoy. Sunbathers were seen brawling on a beach in Broadstairs, Kent, and police were called to a lido in north London amid reports of one large group gathering. With schools in England, Scotland and Wales on a half-term break this week, large numbers of people are expected to emerge from lockdown amid warm conditions. A week after the relaxation of guidelines to allow people to visit beauty spots in England, the Government and the police have urged people to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. Please use common sense when it comes to social distancing, the politan Policeaposs Hillingdon branch tweeted. Apart from crowds at beaches on Monday, long stretches of traffic were also seen at the Yorkshire Dales, while walkers were also out enjoying the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Former Greater Manchester Police chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said officers are frustrated by the Dominic Cummings case, adding it is dficult to see the policeaposs role in controlling lockdown. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Thereaposs a lot of confusion and it feels like thereaposs quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and whataposs happening on the street. I think itaposs quite hard to see the role the police have in the future - the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday itaposs hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.  While new cases and deaths from coronavirus have fallen nationally, a hospital in Somerset was forced to close this weekend due to a high number of Covid- patients. Weston General Hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, stopped accepting new admissions, including into its AE department from am on Monday. As the hospital shut as a precautionary measure, some residents in Weston reported concern over high numbers of people enjoying a day at the seaside. Locals have blamed tourists and VE Day celebrations for the new coronavirus spike that closed Weston General Hospital. On Facebook, one local said: People start flocking to Weston, then cases spike in Weston. Itaposs not rocket science to work out that cramming on the beach, not social distancing has played a big part in this. Stay in your own counties!  Many people would have gone to Weston with the virus and a lot more would have left with it and will now be spreading it around their own communities too! Another blaming VE day celebrations said: They blame it on tourists but loads got together to celebrate VE day, and this spike coincides with VE day - itaposs not always tourists! Many called for lockdown restrictions to be re-tightened and for people to use their common sense. Others called for more police presence.

Bristol has also seen a % rise in demand and the need for help in Sheffield has gone increased by %. The latest figures have been shared by Investec, who are supporting food banks in  cities.

The data also showed that % are now dependent as a result of coronavirus, or underlying health and disability issues. Meanwhile, % had lost their job and were waiting for Universal Credit Claims, % are facing eviction, and % are over the age of . Melanie Rochford from the Trussell Trust said: In times of crisis, more people than ever need help from food banks.  The Covid- pandemic has placed signicant demand on our already overstretched resources to support iniduals and families living below the poverty line. Last year the primary trigger for food poverty was low pay. We are now seeing even more people coming to the service because they are unemployed and struggling to make ends meet. Investec’s support has been an absolute leline. I don’t know what we would have done without it.Investec is working with key suppliers - including Creed in England, Dunns in Scotland, Lidl in Northern Ireland, and Aldi in London - to create the supply chains necessary to stock the food banks. All the food banks belong to the Trussell Trust apart from Edinburgh’s Fresh Start, who are a longstanding community partner of Investec, as well Newham’s First Love Foundation in east London. Deborah Sayagh from Investec Private Bank added: Our ambition in supporting the food banks is that they will always have more than they need over the coming months.  In east London, we have been able to supply nearly , food items and support hundreds of families through this crisis. We are committed to working with them as long as required. At Investec, we fully believe in supporting our local communities and making sure that we live within society, rather than off of it.

Last week’s scorcher saw the hottest day of the year, with a sweltering .C recorded at Santon Downham in Suffolk. Forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: “It’s hotter than the Mediterranean at the moment and it’s going to stay like it all week.  “We’re going to see temperatures well above the average. “It’ll get even hotter as we approach the weekend with C possible on Sunday. “It could beat the record for the hottest day of the year so far.” Rain and thunderstorms brought the heatwave to an abrupt end before a blistering blast on Bank Holiday Monday which saw thousands flock to beaches in Brighton, Bournemouth and Southend despite council warnings to stay away. Today as temperatures hit C, thousands more made trips to beaches in Margate, Kent and Falmouth, Cornwall. The head of the Royal National Leboat Institution called for the government to restrict access to beaches following two deaths on the Cornish coastline yesterday. RNLI chief executive Mark Dowie said the charity could not stop people going to beaches, “but the government can.” He described the charity as being in “an impossible situation”, and said it was being forced to “choose between keeping the public or our leguards safe.” Warnings are also in place to conserve water after rainfall levels slumped in the past three months with water firms asking people to think about their use at home as May’s rainfall stands at less than a quarter of normal levels. In March, the UK experienced  per cent of normal levels and April and May have been even worse, with only  per cent of the average rainfall in April and  per cent so far in May. It has led to fears that the country may face a hosepipe ban despite a wet start to the year.A Met Office spokeswoman said: “It’s been a very dry month across the board, but we do have about a week left and things could become a bit unsettled.”The Met Office has registered only mm of water fall this month compared with the mm average. One water company has applied for a drought order to manage Ennerdale Water in the Lake District. Simon Fluendy, from Southern Water, said the company was already urging more frugal water usage. He added: “We want people to use water wisely because there are big challenges. It is a precious resource. With everyone at home because of the lockdown, they’re using water dferently and there could be an issue with everyone using it at one time.” The Met Office has suggested that the UK is set for a hot summer and there are already worries about trees and plants.

Having that sort of identity going forward.”Appere particularly impressed Connolly, with the -year-old ing from a loan spell at Broughty Athletic in the juniors like a new man.The young attacker has a terric first campaign with the Tangerines, scoring six goals in  appearances and capping it off with a call up in the Scotland U  squad.Connolly continued: “I don’t know what Louis did last summer.“He wasn’t at that level before that but in pre-season he came back, we did a run and he was flying.“In training he was holding people off, using his body. He was like a dferent player.“When you see him running beside you, you have to get away from him because he’s a machine and he’ll show you up.“He’s one of the fittest guys I’ve ever seen now.“I’ve been asking him what he did last summer but he won’t tell me!”As much as the Terrors dominated the league, Connolly was quick to praise the quality of the Championship, particularly part-time teams Alloa and Arbroath.The defender added: “It was my first time in the Championship and it’s a tough league.“It’s a very, very unpredictable league. A lot of the teams you play are more direct.“I found when I was at Kilmarnock, the Premiership was easier at times because you knew what style you were going to be playing against.“Whereas, in the Championship you can come up against  players behind the ball for  minutes.“People can say ‘we have the best players’ and this and that but it’s still very dficult to play against.“Everyone expected us to win every week and always put us downwe didn’t but I think the character of everyone at the club was huge to get over that.“People need to give the likes of Alloa and Arbroath a lot more credit.“The majority of Arbroath’s team could play full-time and Alloa are probably the best team we’ve played, technically.“They pass the ball and play a certain way that suits them.“We struggled against them but they’re actually a decent team.”Connolly missed a chunk of last season with a hamstring injury and, as much as it was hard watching on at times, he is delighted the squad achieved their aim.He is now looking forward to top-flight football when the action s.Connolly reflected: “It was tough – it had been an up and down season for me personally because I had the aim of coming back and being as fit and as lean as I could.“It was probably one of the best shapes I’d been in and I probably pushed myself too hard at times trying to get to that level.“Watching from the side at that stage at the start, when we’d lost a few games, was really, really dficult.“I just wanted to be a part of it and help.“Then when we went on a run it was brilliant to see.

The Prime Minister has said he satisfied that Mr Cummings acted properly and has made his judgement on the matter.#SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford MP said: #What should have been a resignation statement turned out to be a botched PR exercise that changes nothing. It is now beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules.“There was no apology and no contrition from Mr Cummings for his behaviour – and now, following this unrepentant press conference, there are no excuses left for him.“He has done nothing but double down on the double standards he has displayed and which millions of people across the UK are furious about.#Let’s be clear, there is nothing about Mr Cummings that is exceptional except his complete inability to realise he broke the rules.“The Prime Minister has no option but to sack Mr Cummings. His failure to do so so far is a gross failure of leadership.“Boris Johnson has apparently known about this for weeks, has failed to offer any answers himself and now has no option but to sack Dominic Cummings and answer questions about his own role in the Downing Street cover-up.#Boris Johnson#s failure to show leadership is damaging the public health message and putting lives at risk, as leading public health experts have warned.#The longer the Prime Minister allows this farce to continue, the more the Tory government will lose credibility and respect. He must sack Mr Cummings without further delay.#Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for Cummings to be sacked immediately, while Lib Dem MP Wendy Chamberlain said he had undermined advice designed to save lives.She said: #Instead of telling us any new information, Cummings’ statement feels contorted and made to fit with the facts already in the public domain.#The most worrying thing about the Dominic Cummings press conference is that the prime minister heard this version of events yesterday and both accepted and stated it demonstrated responsibility and integrity.#The only new information that Cummings has provided are admissions of further breaches of the rules. He has undermined the public advice designed to save lives and his position is now beyond untenable.#Dundee East SNP MSP Shona Robison said: #It’s clear that Dominic Cummings has broken a number of lockdown rules.#Today we saw no apologies and no regrets. People in Dundee have made huge sacrices over the past few months to obey the rules, while Boris Johnson#s most senior adviser was breaking them, he should do the decent thing and resign.#Mr Leonard said: #Dominic Cummings has failed in his attempt to justy his actions.#What is particularly upsetting for people listening to his statement is that they have followed the lockdown rules while Dominic Cummings did not.#Some people have missed the chance to spend final moments with a loved one, some have missed their loved ones’ funerals. Some have had no help with childcare, despite illness. Some people’s sacrices during this time will leave a lasting trauma.#Dominic Cummings has not apologised for his actions. He stands by his decision to put other people#s lives in danger, showing he believes he is above the rules everyone  is following.#Boris Johnson’s handling of this situation has been unacceptable. Dominic Cummings should be sacked immediately.#Dunfermline SNP MP Douglas Chapman said: #He has not resigned, he#s not sorry, he has severely undermined confidence in the UK Government and their ability to govern with our consent.#In Scotland we have a road map to get out of this health crisis.

ban","story":"Aberdeen City Council#s funding bid to dramatically change Union Street has been approved.The local authority applied to the Scottish Government’s Spaces for People fund to ensure the city is safe as it emerges from lockdown and peopleto the streets.It has now confirmed it has secured the £. million grant to go ahead with its plans, which would turn the city#s main thoroughfare into a car-free zone.It plans to introduce temporary measures along Union Street so it is only open to public transport, cyclists and pedestrians along its entirefrom the Castlegate to Holburn Street.Measures also include pedestrianisation, pavement widening, temporary bike lanes and one-way walking systems.Work will start in the next few weeks, and theof time they will remain in place will be determined by NHS and Government guidance.It is being carried out as the city centre and Union Street in particular faces challenges around social distancing, as the pavements are not wide enough to accommodate m between people.Traffic will be re-routed to free up carriageway space for businesses, pedestrians, cyclists and transport users.There will also be temporary changes to the road layout and on-street parking to widen pavements on Rosemount, Victoria Road in Torry, Peterculter, Cults, North Deeside Road and George Street.Additional signage will also be in place.The council said in later stages of easing lockdown, further changes such as reducing parking spaces may also be required to ensure there is enough space for pedestrians to socially distance, and ensure the numbers of those visiting the city centre is manageable.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Councillor Jenny Laing said: “We welcome the grant funding which will be used to implement temporary active travel measures, helping to ensure people can walk and cycle during this public health emergency whilst physically distancing and keeping safe from traffic.“These temporary interventions will help us meet the health and wellbeing needs of residents during this dficult time and will allow people to move safely around Aberdeen which will in turn start the social and economic recovery of the city and the wider region.”NHS Grampian director of public health Susan Webb added: #This is great news. We were happy to support this bid for funding and see it be successful it will help make it as easy as possible for people to take exercise and access key services while observing physical distancing.#Meanwhile, the city centre BID group Aberdeen Inspired also backed the plans.Chief executive Adrian Watson said: #I am delighted to find that Aberdeen City Council have been successful in their ‘Spaces for People’ funding application. It is to their credit they worked constructively with Aberdeen Inspired and other partners in proactively bringing a plan together that will allow us to open up our great city centre in a safe and pragmatic fashion, and in so doing open up further opportunities for re-visioning the space as we moved forward.#The measures also aim to increase capacity at community #pinch points# and along popular arterial business and leisure walking and cycling routes, as well as near health facilities, parks, schools and other public buildings.Aberdeen City Council said it would continue to review, monitor and evaluate the situation when the measures are in place.The fund was administered by sustainable transport body Sustrans Scotland.Karen McGregor, director of Sustrans Scotland, said: “It’s clear that people across Scotland want to do the right thing during Coronavirus. They want to look after their physical and mental health.“They also want to make sure that they are keeping to physical distancing guidelines while still being safe on our streets.“Providing funding support to Aberdeen City Council through our Spaces for People programme will make it easier and safer for people to travel around their city for essential travel and exercise.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741862-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741862-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741862-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741862-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"new north east cafe reopens for takeaway with special afternoon tea","story":"A north-east cafe which opened three weeks before lockdown is easing its way back to business with a new takeaway service.Sally#s Cafe in Portlethen was taken over by Sally Adam in the weeks before the coronavirus crisis.After only three weeks in operation the eatery shut its doors to comply with government regulations.As the country prepares to phase out of lockdown, Sally#s has started to offer a full menu of sweet and savoury snacks for local residents to take home and feast on.Sally said: “It was a real impulse buy, we saw on Facebook that the previous owner was giving it up.

Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll adventure saddles up for public support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe owner of an Inveraray equine and outdoor activity centre is looking for customers# help as lockdown bites.It#s fair to say Andy Cameron could have had an easier start to running Argyll Adventure.The business has operated at Dalchenna Farm for two decades in its current format and -year-old Andy took over the reins at the end of .Argyll Adventure#s bread and butter is horse riding # trekking through the hills above Loch Fyne.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world.

the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid

.pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

they say they canrsquot sleepto think of a place to go, then close their eyes and make it happen in their dreams.So Irsquove been taking my own advice and stories are taking me to favourite places that in normal times I would be visiting in reality.One of these is Woodhall Dean.I walked through its oak wood in my imagination recently, and I realised I still hadnrsquot solved the mystery of why there is a location called Tinkerrsquos Leap by the steep sided burn.So I decided to ask Jess Smith, the renowned traveller and author.She told me that the story comes from Covenanting times but she couldnrsquot recall it from the top of her head.She will search it out in what she calls her ldquocave of books and recordings.But she immediately rolled off another tale, which comes from the same region and fits the bill.It is a tale shared by Border travellers, as they moved from place to place and in whose company she ldquospent many a campsite stick fire with.She painted a picture of the story culture she comes from. Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-caravan-bid-rejected","story":"Lammermuir Livery and Stables wanted to provide accommodation for relief staff for their stable manager to live at their rural base at Castlemains Farm, Gford, to run the business.And they hoped East Lothian Council would back their planthe caravans were hidden from sight on nearby land already used to store mobile homes and other vehicles.However councillor officers refused to grant planning permission and the councilrsquos Local Review Body backed their decision during an online meeting this week when they refused an appeal against it.The planning application, which was retrospective also asked for permission to have an office, already built at the entrance to to site, but that was also rejected by the review body.Making their case for the caravans, the firm said: ldquoWhen considering this we were aware of the visual impact a caravan could have on the landscapeand decided the best option would be to site the caravan in the existing storage yard in an area designated for that purpose, this area already has caravans stored, which we have permission forand therefore the caravan would not be a new thing in that area.HoweverCouncillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairperson, described the decision to let people live in a storage area as lsquounacceptablersquo.He said: ldquoI do not think residential caravans on a storage site is an acceptable place for people to be living.The stables had also argued that there was not secure space within the equestrian buildings it had at he farm for an office and one needed to be built on another part of the land, however this was also dismissed by the review body.Members carried out inidual site visits to the farm ahead of meeting todayonline.Councillor Sue Kempson said: ldquoThe caravans are in the wrong place and should not be used as living accommodation on a storage site, it sets a precedent.ldquoLooking around the equestrian site there is plenty of room to provide a secure office so I am supporting the officersrsquo decision.Fellow body member Councillor Kenny McLeod made the decision unanimous when he ruled the office and caravans were too far away from the centre itself to be of any benefit.Planning officers refused the original application for temporary planning permission for five years for the office and caravans retrospectively, stating there was no business case for the equestrian business to support the need for the additional building and that the caravans would set an ldquoundesirable precedent.The applicants had told the review body their agent, who had been asked to provide a business case, had ldquovanished and they had no knowledge of the request."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

For over a year this tiny offshoot has been sinking its roots deep. Above ground, however, itrsquos little more than a frond. With the solicitude of a father for his firstborn, Alan has been watering it since March, and awaiting the first leaves of the season. Buds eventually appeared, followed by the unfurling of glistening leaves the colour of old pennies. Just the other day he witnessed the arboreal equivalent of a childrsquos first day at school: a sparrow alighting on its branches, treating it like a real tree.The gardener who told us how to plant it said that it canrsquot get enough watering. Itrsquoll take however much you pour on it, allowing roots to take hold, and speeding its growth. So when eventually the clouds opened the other evening, it was the infant beech I thought of, soaking it up before reaching for the sky.As the rain pounded on the skylights, I stood at the window. Lit by the streetlamp on the village green, water filled the cobbled gutter. It rushed blackly towards the drain, a sprinkling of fallen apple blossom bobbing on the tide, asa wedding party had just passed. Through the small hours the downpour continued. I could lie awake all night listening to it. When I was growing up my bedroom was in an attic. Early in the morning seagullsrsquo flippers would patter over the roof, and the slightest breath of wind or rain was amplied by the rattling windows and nearby trees. The worse the weather, the more I enjoyed it.This astonishingly dry and sunny spring has been a boon during lockdown, the best possible antidote to gloom. I donrsquot like to imagine how miserable it would have beenthere had been incessant damp and cloudy skies. Yet surrounded as we are in Hoolet by fields of crops, and with flocks and herds munching grass, lack of rain means everything suffers. Cattle especially have been known to break out in search of water, thirst driving them slightly nuts.Following last weekrsquos cloudburst, the village has emerged from its dousing like a bridesmaid from the hairdresserrsquos. At first light the blackbirds were out in force, working their way across the green, combing every inch. I read that itrsquos been a good year for blackbirds, but that was hardly news. The place has been jumping with them for weeks, males chasing off rivals or fighting mid-air asreenacting the Battle of Britain. Females have been shopping for worms in pairs. No patch of lawn or grass goes unforaged, the birds keeping several feet apart, like customers at a supermarket checkout. Ousting wood pigeons and thrushes from telegraph poles, they declare their territory and every few minutes one flies past the window at such speed, yoursquod think it had been fired from a gun.A year or two past, one of our neighbours found a blackbird lying stricken in his garden. Alive but bleeding, it was being mobbed by other birds. He took out a chair, and sat near it for the rest of the afternoon, until it had recovered enough to fly off. He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart. You feel a pheasant is capable of walking on to the Christmas platter and arranging the carrots and parsnips around itself while it waits for the gravy blackbirds, on the other hand, know how to take advantage of what we can offer.Given the kerfuffle they make in the beech hedge, they could be devouring a packet of crisps. They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green. Irsquom less certain about our bluetits. Occasional cheeping can be heard from the nest box, but itrsquos too early to knowtheyrsquoll survive. Caterpillars are their food of choice, but as the butterfly population declines, so does their larder. Might they have something put away in case of a rainy day "},{"url":null,"title":"paul-tamburrinis-lockdown-feast-caesar-salad-fried-chicken-chococolate-cate-chocolate-sorbet","story":"This weeks recipes are a sumptuous three-course meal fit for any table:Caesar salad with lettuce emulsionServes - starters Romaine lettuce hearts, cut into bite sized bitesg parmesan shavings fillets of good quality anchovies in oil, halved waysFor the bread croutons Day old baguetteExtra virgin olive oilSea saltFor the dressingfrac cloves of garlic, green germ removed and finely grated fillets of salted anchovies in oil free range eggsml red wine vinegartsp Dijon mustardml grapeseed oilg finely grated parmesanJuice of frac lemonfrac tsp of Worcestershire sauce drops of TabascoSalt and black pepper to tasteFor the lettuce emulsiong Baby gems leaves, green only ndash washed frac tsp Dijon mustardml vegetable oilml cold waterTable saltFor the bread tuillesPreheat the oven to C ndash cut  very thinly slices from the baguette, so you have  per person.

But it highlights going green as part of a recovery that would cut carbon emissions and create jobs, while including support for investment in clean industry and transport, making buildings net-zero, carbon capture and storage.The plan would also seek to take better advantage of Scotlandrsquos green energy revolution, which the Herald revealed was increasingly being placed in the hands of overseas firms.Camleys Cartoon: Green energy jobs.In Scotland, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has revealed it wants to see a new Future Jobs Fund to back a construction and \"deep\" retrofit housing programme, to make existing homes more environmentally friendly, while creating \"good quality\" jobs and driving decarbonisation of heat, reducing emissions and fuel bills.In , in the wake of a financial crisis which resulted in the bailout of banks the threat of high youth unemployment loomed, and the government created the Future Jobs Fund, which paid employers a wage subsidy to take on young people.The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by , five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.An upgrade to our existing housing stock to be become energy-efficient means improving the fabric of the buildings.STUC deputy general secretary Dave Moxham said that capital investment should go into a \"better regulated\" construction sector and \"serious consideration\" given to the creation of a Scottish National Construction company.\"Scotlandrsquos housing stock, with a high proportion of tenement properties, is not the easiest to retrofit with energy saving measures such as insulation and new heating systems, however progress on deep retrofit has been identied as one of the key elements in achieving net zero,\" he said.\"There has also been a tendency to shallow retrofit building meaning that one emissions saving measure is introduced with other adaptations undertaken later on or not at all. This crisis and the need to plan better and create jobs provides an ideal opportunity establish a programme of deep-retrofit, nationally co-ordinated and locally delivered.\"It is analogous to the massive effort in the early s when the UK converted millions of gas boilers to be offshore gas compliant, creating thousands upon thousands of jobs and massively boosting the economy. Such a programme is best driven by state investment and delivered through nationally co-ordinated or even a nationalised construction company. As well as providing a much needed boost for jobs and apprenticeships it would have a serious and positive impact on fuel poverty.\"The Coalition for the Energy Efficiency of Buildingsargues that such a retrofit programme would slash emissions, create jobs and could reboot a battered post-Covid economy.The CEEB, which is backed by the UK government and the City of London Corporation, argues that such an approach would support more than , skilled and semi-skilled construction jobs, provide a quick economic stimulus and boost consumer spending through energy cost savings.Mr Moxham said lessons can be learned from the collapse of construction giant Carillion two years ago which cost UK taxpayers an estimated poundm.When it was liquidated with debts of pound.bn, the firm had about  UK public sector contracts.\"The collapse provided evidence of how an massive under-regulated private sector companies can fail with all real risk transferred to workers and the public sector,\" he said.\"A publicly owned construction company could guarantee better and less precarious employment practices twinned with a co-ordinated approach to green construction and retrofitting.\"Undertaking such actions requires investment and increases government indebtedness, however the nature of such government borrowing is that it is borrowing against its own future. \"Thus a green Future Jobs Fund would see a massive expansion in the training of and provision of good jobs for young people. Taken in conjunction with overall economic boost it would provide one of the most effective ways to borrow to invest.\"In , a Scottish Government report stated the offshore wind sector alone offered the potential for , direct jobs and a further , jobs in related industries, as well as pound.bn investment in Scotland by .The Scottish Governmentrsquos low carbon strategydescribed the large scale development of offshore wind as representing the ldquobiggest opportunity for sustainable economic growth in Scotland for a generation with Scotland having an estimated % of Europersquos offshore wind potential.But in February, it emerged that it had in fact created just sixper cent of the , direct jobs predicted. Official estimates stated that there were just , full-time jobs in the offshore wind sector in Scotland, a fraction of the numbers projected by .Mr Moxham said: \"Thus far the then First Minister Alex Salmonds comments that Scotland would become the lsquoSaudi Arabiarsquo of renewables has failed to materialise.\"He said there should be \"much stricter conditionality\" attached to contracts for renewable construction in Scotland to \"ensure a radical improvement\" in the number of local supply chain jobs in offshore and other renewables.\"It is essential that we offer meaningful and well-paid employment for those likely to suffer from the current and longer-term downturn in offshore oil and gas,\" he said.His views come as the TUC called for the government to form a National Recovery Council to help the economy heal from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.It said lessons can be learned from former prime minister Clement Attleersquos  government, which inherited massive wartime debts but saw them slide rapidly as the economy recovered.The Labour administration launched the NHS, a welfare safety net and mass housebuilding, nationalised industries and sought to boost demand to maintain full employment.d on short-term crisis management and wary about the rising costs of existing crisis measures.TUC analysis showed that the decade of investment for growth between  and  that followed World War II achieved an average growth rate of . per cent.

She is an impressive leader. And not just in her delivery.Ms Sturgeonrsquos political handling of this crisis has also been exemplary. She has followed essentially the same strategy as the UK Government, made all the same mistakes and then some, but has somehow managed to devolve responsibility for those mistakes to Westminster.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: No country for old men. The bitter harvest in Scotlandrsquos care homesLast week, she unveiled her four-step programme for ing to normality which is, in all major respects, the same as the UK one. But by delaying it a fortnight, while accusing Boris Johnson of playing ldquoRussian roulette with peoplersquos lives she has made it sound asshersquos protected Scots from a government of Bolsanaro-emulating herd immunity fanatics.There is not a great deal of evidence for this. Nicola Sturgeon said a fortnight ago that it was not safe to follow the UK path because the ldquoall-important R number in Scotland was too high at between . and .. Yet last week, as she announced her new regime, the R number was still between . and ..She insists that the number of infections is down, which is true. But the rate of spread of the virus, which R measures, is not crucially dependent on the number of cases. The risk of the pandemic getting loose again has changed very little.But people think it has, and in politics, that is all that really matters. ldquo#ThankYouNicola was trending on social media. The SNP is riding ever higher in popularity. The FMrsquos treatment by opposition leaders in the chamber sounded almost respectful.There has been an assumption, shared by most of the Scottish media, that Nicola Sturgeon is showing the way, not following a few steps behind. Her government commands a degree of respect that Westminster lacks. ldquoIrsquom sorry to interrupt you, Mr Swinney, said a reverential Good Morning Scotland presenter the day after the route map was unveiled.Yet, in that very interview, the Deputy First Minister all but admitted that the governmentrsquos aim of , contact tracers by next week was falling way short. Only  have been signed up, but Swinney assured us that this would be quite enough. Oh yes.On testing, the Scottish Governmentrsquos record is poor any way you look at it. Not only in contact tracing which is well behind England, where , tracers have been recruited, but also in the headline number of tests.The UK was testing , a day last week and is on course for , a day. In Scotland only , are being tested, according to the Scottish Parliament Information Service. On a per-capita basis it should be almost ten times that.Now, the purpose of all this testing is admittedly unclear, north and south of the Border. The clinical advisers in Scotland have always been distinctly cool on community testing, at least in the current phase. The former CMO, Dr Catherine Catherwood, famously called it a ldquodistraction.However, everyone agrees now that one of the major failings of the UKrsquos response to the pandemic was a lack of preparedness and a failure to install the architecture of TTI: test, track and isolate. Progress in Scotland can only be described as glacial.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Its easy to scare people into staying home harder to persuade them to come out againThen there is the avoidable tragedy in Scotlandrsquos care homes, which I wrote about last week. This was the policy, hotly denied, that old people were cleared out of acute hospitals without proper testing and sent often to care homes where the virus spread rapidly.Last week, the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, finally came clean about the elderly clearance, and said nearly , had been discharged in March alone. She had previously said only  had been so decanted.This is a serious error and calls into question the competence of the minister and the health service bureaucrats upon whom she relies. It comes on top of the inexplicable failure to inform the public about the major Covid outbreak in February at a Nike conference in Edinburgh.There is every sign of a massive buck-passing operation between the NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer, the Care Inspectorate and the private care homes, all trying to blame each other for the care home scandal.Nicola Sturgeon admitted last week that there had been a panic reaction to the forecast of , Covid deaths made in mid-March by the disgraced Imperial College epidemiologist, Professor Neil Ferguson. She said hospitals feared they were about to be ldquofilled up with coronavirus cases and so discharged as many old patients as possible into care. In the event, the wards have lain empty as old people died.Nearly half of all Covid deaths in Scotland have been in care homes. The misery this policy has inflicted on Scotlandrsquos senior citizens, dying in cruel isolation, is unimaginable.Lessons will be learned etc. However, no-one seems to regard these as lessons particularly for the First Minister. Similarly, criticism of confusions in her route map to normality go right over her head.Garden centres and bowling greens can open, but people canrsquot use the toilets, which make it rather pointless. The ldquoblended solution to teaching means parents will have to remain at home even after schools go back in August. The tourism and hospitality industry is in despair, forecasting losses of up to , jobs.But Nicola Sturgeon is safe and socially distanced from blame. She has the shield of confidence around her, burnished by the flattering attentions of legions SNP supporters, who dominate social media.It has now become clear that the PMrsquos closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been bending the lockdown rules to travel Durham, with the full sanction of Boris Johnson.The UK media seems mainly interested in using Scotland as a stick to beat the Prime Minister. The Sky presenter, Kay Burley, urged UK political leaders last week to ldquotake a leaf out of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos book.It is also, of course, because Boris Johnsonrsquos handling of the crisis has been confused and erratic. The messaging about ldquoStay Alert was vague, the rules about travel incomprehensible, the attempt to reopen the schools cack-handed.:Iain Macwhirter: Failures over testing means no end to coronavirus lockdown in ScotlandThe UK Government has oscillated between promises of wonder apps and ldquogame-changing breakthroughs, like antibody tests, and panicky pronouncements that have led to invasive crackdowns by the police. The decision to introduce draconian -day quarantine for travellers may have made sense two or three months ago, but seems pointless now.Westminsterrsquos approach has been an object lesson in poor leadership, which will be examined by students of governance for many years.

To complain that Scotland is at least \"three weeks behind England\" ignores the fact that the virus has taken time to spread northwards. It is now some weeks since Covid- peaked in London. Then for some reason he criticises the First Minister for pursuing a four-phased approach to easing lockdown which is \"in sharp contrast to what the Prime Minister has introduced\". But surely such a phased approach in England is exactly what Boris Johnson announced, and indeed Downing Street has just claimed credit for what is now being rolled out in Scotland The real problem, however, for Mr Stevenson is public reaction. I think that it is abundantly clear that the cautious and measured approach of our First Minister commands considerable public support, which stands in stark contrast with how Boris Johnsonrsquos decisions are perceived. His rushed and ill-thought-out decision to insist that schools in England should be opened on June  is a classic example of how not to proceed. While here in Scotland the decision to bring pupils back to school on August  Not surprisingly the mood in England is one of confusion and concern. According to reports, the UK Governmentrsquos policy to reopen schools will not be followed by perhaps as many as  local authorities. Teaching unions have expressed serious reservations on behalf of their members. Schools and teachers have been given little time to physically prepare their teaching programmes, classrooms, toilets and playgrounds for the childrenrsquos safe . The scientic advice also urges caution. The Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England warns that ldquothe essential well-ing local test, trace and isolate protocols will not be in place in England by early June, Not surprisingly the latest opinion poll suggests that the June  start has the support of only  per cent of parents a large majority would prefer a September . This is in marked contrast to experience here, where I would suggest public support for the \"glacial easing\" remains strong.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.STRUAN Stevensons article was a timely reminder,such were needed, that the Tories have,anything, consolidated their position as the Nasty Party. His advocacy of rapid easing of lockdown belittles the suffering of those who have already died from the effects of the virus, the courage and dedication of those in the NHS and the care sector and the fears of those of us who, because of existing medical conditions, are at high riskwe contract the virus. While recognising the damage that the economy is suffering, the cavalier disregard he displays for the human costs likely to be incurred through easing too much, too soon, is appalling.We should, of course, not be surprised by this. The UK has a Prime Minister who lies, sleeps around and failed to take action in the early stages of the pandemic, preferring meaningless twaddle about British exceptionalism. In Priti Patel we have a Home Secretary who smirkingly advances legislation that would shut off the opportunities granted to her family in the past ldquopull up the drawbridge, Im OK. Jacob Rees-Mogg openly flaunts the opportunities he has helped to create for dubious financial deals, the profits from which he stashes away in overseas tax havens until such time as this Government provides similar facilities for the ultra-rich within the country. Having promised that food standards would not be compromised in the search for trade deals toreplace those within the EU, Parliament then votes to remove all such protection to appease the United States.As for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings, words fail me. His complete disregard for the letter and spirit of the emergency measures, is beyond belief.What is also surprising, in a smaller way, is that you chose to devote half a page to Mr Stevensons nonsense.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.IT is becoming abundantly clear with each passing day that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos calculated decision to \"grandstand\" her position as First Minister by trailing Englandrsquos easing of the Corona lockdown in order for Scotland \"to go its own way\" is beginning to backfire on her ndash indeed, Struan Stevenson astutely sees through her lame excuses that she is not playing politics .Also, the SNPrsquos request for Westminster to extend the furlough scheme beyond October for Scotland has been essentially denied, piling pressure on the First Minister to catch up with England in respect of lockdown easing.Now, instead of being perceived as leading from the front, increasingly, Ms Sturgeon is going to be perceived as passively following from behind ndash not a good track-record for entering the  Holyrood elections.Philip Adams, Crosslee.I WAS going to sit down and compose a y, erudite response to Struan Stevensons interesting take on the Scottish Governments proposed road map. Then I read your leader columnand put my pen away.Alastair Clark, Stranraer.STRUAN Stevenson has a good go at the Scottish Government. Fine, thats what Tories do, but I must comment on his sign-off, \"Historically, pandemics either ended with the medical containment of the disease, which in our case could occur with the development of a vaccine, or they end when society loses its fear of the virus\"He suggests that since a vaccine is a long way off, \"its time we lost our fear\".Grand, there are three ways to do this.First, be immune. Secondly, die of the virus. Or of course, you could go the third way, and thats to be so rich and isolated from real le, as it is lived by most of the rest of us, that you are not affected by it, nor do you have to give a hoot.AJ Clarence, Prestwick.I THINK I am a reasonably tolerant man. I very rarely lose my temper. But I am enraged by Dominic Cummingss behaviour. How dare he  The lockdown instructions were very clear, despite the weasel words of the deputy English Chief Medical Officer, Jenny Harries. She knows that she dare not say anything against her masters for fear of losing her job.Everyone and their auntie knows that he did the wrong thing. Trying to excuse it on a technicality just makes it worse. Then we are told it was because he was concerned for his four-year-old son. Really  Did he not have any other options open to him  Does he not have any friends who live locally  I suppose not. But whose fault is that Why should I or anyone  follow Matt Hancocks instruction  Ill tell you why. Because it raises the risk to others.Robin Mather, Musselburgh.DOMINIC Cummings ndash the perfect example of the adage dont do as I do, do as I tell you.Dave Biggart, Kilmacolm.INTERESTING that despite reasonably positive public opinion of Nicola Sturgeons handling of the pandemic in Scotland, there were three negative letters in The Herald . The performance of the Scottish Government has certainly not been flawless, but the criticism, to paraphrase Mr James Martin, is pathetic.First, Ms Sturgeon would have been severely criticisedshe had erged from the UK at the beginning of the outbreak, and the UK was slow. Secondly, as a retired clinician, I disagree with retired NHS manager Danny Crawford about patient confidentiality. It was, presumably, suggested by clinicians and accepted by the First Minister. It may be a moot point, but I would side with that view. If there was poor contact tracing, that needs to be avoided in the future.Finally, I get the impression that whatever Ms Sturgeon and the current Scottish Government do, these correspondents and their ilk will find a reason to criticise. R McMurtrie talks about Ms Sturgeons empathy, but many would consider hers as genuine concern for others. Would he prefer Boris Johnsons or Priti Patels form of \"empathy\" George Rhind, Clydebank.UNTIL now, according to the UK Government daily reports, approximately three million people in England have been tested for Covid-. On a pro rata basis that could mean that we have tested approximately , people in Scotland. However, any figures I have heard do not at all approach this figure.I accept that, as the First Minister says, testing is not the silver bullet, but as it is being touted strongly by the World Health Organisation, surely we should be maximising our efforts in this regard and letting the Scottish people know the results.W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.THE proposedof golf to being one of our permitted activities has been greeted with a fanfare. Further along the Scottish Governments route map, we are advised to drive no more than five miles.The authors of this document are obviously unaware of the fact that many golfers live as many as  or more miles from their clubs.

The James Herriot of the noughties is a pioneering orthopaedic-neuro veterinary surgeon forever pushing the boundaries of possibility. ldquoCutting edge in All Creatures Great and Small, in contrast, was someone donning a rubber glove before inserting an arm into a cowrsquos backside.Think, then, of Scottish Vets Down Under, a new -part documentary series, as a pleasant middle ground between homely All Creatures and shiny, high-tech The Supervet.Made by the Aussie firm WildBear Entertainment for BBC Scotland, it was a true story of two young vets who met  years ago at university and became best pals.Dr Chris Ellison was the tall one who specialised in small animals, while Dr Mike Whiteford was the short stop who ran an equine hospital.The voiceover introduced them as two Scottish vets who had ldquoturned their lives upside down and set out on an adventure of a letime, which made it sound as though they were newly arrived.As we learned later, Dr Mike went out  years ago, with Dr Chris following. Both had successful practices in the rural town of Bendingo. It would have been more dramaticthey had just been starting out, but you canrsquot have everything.As it was, the thrills in Scottish Vets Down Under were of the small-scale, animal-centred iety. That was fine by me, as was Drs Mike and Chris being ordinary, unassuming guys rather than the dreaded ldquocharacters so many reality television series seek. Uncomplicated was good. It was dferent. Whether we will still be feeling that way a few more episodes in, who knows.First client through the door of Bendingo Animal Hospital was a wedge-tailed eagle found lying on its stomach in a paddock. With a wing-span of . metres, these birds can down a kangaroo. Dr Chris, wisely, sent the bird for a snooze while he examined him. While doing so he found out that ldquohe was in fact a ldquoshe.There were no breaks in the wings, which left the possibility of poisoning. Only thing for it was to wait and hope.Arriving at Dr Mikersquos was a week old foal that had run into a metal fence. A facial injury would be bad news for any creature, but especially one set to be a racehorse. After an op by Dr Mike and his fiancee Dr Sarah Jalim, it was a bandage round the nose for the foal. Another case of wait and see.Easier in one way was the case of Clive the dog. Clive, -years-young, had terrible earache. He wouldnrsquot let his beloved owner, Kay, near his lug. Like the wedge-tailed eagle, Clive was sent on a snooze.The problem was a small grass seed wedged in his ear. ldquoLike little daggers, said Chrisrsquos fiance, Dr Claire. She plucked out the one in the ear, plus several more on his coat, and delivered him back into the arms of Kay, who gave a loud sigh of relief.Otherwise, the chaps meet a koala and learned how to do a ldquokoala bellow. Fun fact: koalas have three fingers and two thumbs. Not so fun fact: they suffer from chlamydia a lot.

Rather than engage with people as thinking, intelligent citizens, with big political ideals and arguments, this micro-politics focused on the minutiae of everyday le and attempted, as the name suggests, to change our behaviour.More akin to a relationship between a parent and child rather than between political representatives and citizens, the politics of behaviour promotes policies, with the help of ldquoexperts, that attempt to ldquonudge us here and there, to ensure we ldquobehave responsibly.The newer assemblies, the Scottish Parliament being a leading example, have adopted the politics of behaviour with a particular zeal, attempting through a iety of new laws, taxes and initiatives, to regulate how we smoke, drink, talk, and even how we raise our children.The distrusting and infantilising nature of the politics of behaviour helps to explain some of the more patronising and irrational policies adopted during the lockdown and also helps to explain why Scotland is more backwards when it comes to freeing up society.What is called an ldquoenabling state finds the idea of free iniduals who ldquoact, rather than merely ldquobehaving dficult to comprehend. Consequently, we continue to be given simplistic slogans and irrational micro managerial instructions about what to do once we dare to leave our homes.With this in mind, it is worth reminding the First Minister, our political representative, of that Ancient Greek phrase primus inter pares ndash it means First Among Equals.

What utter garbage. Cummings is loaded, hersquos married to a baronetrsquos daughter and Johnson wasnrsquot just born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he swallowed the whole canteen of cutlery.They are the elite ndash they sneer at people like you and me ndash only now theyrsquore finally showing you just how the elite behaves. Itrsquos not merely about lsquoone rule for you and one rule for mersquo. Itrsquos the utter immorality, the swaggering, dangerous, screw-you arrogance of the pair.Cummings actively doesnrsquot care what anyone thinks. And Johnson is so sociopathically narcissistic that the idea that the rest of us have feelings or needs or moral beliefs doesnrsquot penetrate his painstakingly disarranged hair-do.Your mother might be dying in a care home, your son might be languishing in a bedsit alone, you might be desperate to see them but to hell with you, what do you matter  Yoursquore not Dom, yoursquore not Boris.Why should Dom and Boris follow the same rules as you  Yoursquore you, theyrsquore them.

Shut up, sit down hellip let the idiots in Downing Street do the thinking.Andthe peasants revolt and start copying their masters ndash breaking lockdown, driving about the country, journeying to relatives while sweating and coughing up virus ndash well, therersquos laws for people like that. And maybe a bit of herd immunity will sort them out into the bargain.Cummings can flout rules which were written to keep people alive, and then sneer at the public and the press for having the temerity to question him.Whatrsquos truly disgusting about the whole affair and Johnsonrsquos defence of his charismatically-challenged Asda Price Rasputin, is the use of the Cummingsrsquo child. Every single one of us has fretted over our children these last few months. Many of us have cried for our children.With Coronavirus affecting his we and then him, Cummings says he needed childcare for his son. Downing Street thought dragging the child into the public spotlight as an excuse would keep the peasants quiet. His lordshiprsquos child needed love and attention - surely, the oiks would understand that, eventheir own brats were mewling at home.ldquoThe kid is the trump card, one Downing Street source said of the Defend Dom strategy.Well, that backfired. To paraphrase the PM, Johnson has spaffed his premiership up the wall. Therersquos no coming ndash forgive the terrible pun ndash back from this.

However there have been calls from some MPs # including some within the Prime Minister#s own party # for Mr Cummings to be let go.Mr Cummings made a statement yesterday during which he said he did not regret his actions. He explained that he made the journey on the Easter weekend so that family members could look after his son. Cummings said his we was already ill and he suspected he himself would fall ill and may be unable to care for his child.Speaking yesterday Mr Carmichael: “From day one the government have employed the rhetoric of war when talking about the effort needed to deal with the COVID- pandemic. When so many people across the country have made such great sacrices in the prosecution of that war it is unacceptable that Dominic Cummings should be behave like this and not suffer any consequences.“Dominic Cummings’ behaviour – and the decision of the Prime Minister to support him – risks undermining public confidence in the messaging of government.  It is also clearly consuming time and energy in government that could be better spent on tackling the disease.“In all the circumstancesDominic Cummings will not resign then the Prime Minister should dismiss him.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full. Exceptionally, requests for a loan period of up to  years may be considered.Businesses can find guidance and check the criteria for funding here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-Loan-Guide and,eligible, apply online here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-LoanThose that are unsure about their eligibility should contact the Council’s economic development team for advice at economic.development@orkney.gov.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing.

There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter.

Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

Hatston will be open from .am to .pm and Garson from .am to .am. Both will be closed between .pm and .pm.Andrew Drever, vice-chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We thank folk for their patience while our sites were closed, as we waited for national advice on essential travel in Scotland to change.“I hope people will welcome the step-by-step approach we are taking to opening the sites again and understand the need for them to operate dferently to the way they did before the pandemic.“This is to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to the sites. Limiting the number of cars and visitors on site at any particular time will enable social and physical distancing. We would urge those visiting to stay at least two metres away from staff and from other visitors on site.”Councillor Drever said: “Both sites are likely to be very busy for the first few days. To avoid the risk of waiting in long queues, we would ask folk to use them onlyit is absolutely necessary.“As a way to spread visits across the week, we are suggesting that you make your visit –possible – on your normal bin collection day. If your bin collection day is a Mondaywe’d suggest that you visit on a Saturday instead.”He added: “As summer approaches we know that many folk will be keen to dispose of waste from their gardens.“That’s why we are concentrating on this when the sites re-open as part of the phased approach we are taking. For the time being, no other materials can be disposed of at Hatston or Garson.”This will be kept under review and, when possible, the sites will start to take other materials as well.Decisions on opening the other HWRCs – and recycling points in the isles – will be taken at a later date as part of the phased approach the council is taking.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And wersquoll do that for as long as the virus remains on these shores. vw,vw,px, px\"Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock Later in the briefing, Mr Hancock was asked about NHS staff not being properly ldquofit tested for PPE.He said: ldquoI know there was some problems with that at the start, I hope wersquove resolved them now. It was all going from needing normal amounts of PPE to needing very high amounts of PPE.Issues with PPE have been one of the major issues during the pandemic.Supply chains around the world broke down as the pandemic took hold in each country. vw, px\"Doctor Abdul Mabud Chowdhury In the UK, desperate staff described how they were left in tears over shortages, with some being forced to buy their own equipment online and others ldquohiding gear in hospital to ensure they had enough for their next sht.The Government has faced heavy criticism on the issue, particularly over the death of a doctor who died after warning about a lack of the equipment.Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury died in April after being diagnosed with Covid-. Five days before he was admitted to hospital, Dr Chowdhury, , wrote a Facebook post asking Prime Minister Boris Johnson to urgently provide every NHS worker with PPE.Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said: ldquoSince the pandemic began, there have been considerable dficulties around PPE, including accessing particular items such as gowns, and the withdrawal of Tiger Eye goggles. The stockpile in the UK was clearly not fit for a coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHowever, we recognise that this has been a huge logistical challenge to not only secure kit whilst there is huge global demand, but also operationally to deliver it to the front line.ldquoIt is good to see progress is being made in signing contracts with suppliers for equipment produced here in the UK, as well as securing  new suppliers overseas.ldquoTrusts have also been playing their part in securing more supplies. For example, therersquos been an initiative in the north east involving Barbour who have used their factory in South Shields to make gowns for a range of trusts in the surrounding area.copy -.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!!

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

It is so important that we support our local farmers and producers.“Ballymena Weekly Market has been operating in the town for many years and its origins date back to the s, when King Charles I stipulated a Saturday market under the terms of the sale of the land that Ballymena is built on.“The reopening of the markets will help provide a safe shopping experience and support the local economy as we move through the first tentative steps towards the easing of lockdown restrictions.”Alderman Billy Ashe MBE added: “This is a welcome development as I know many local people have been missing being able to go the markets during recent weeks and months.“I must congratulate the traders and council staff for working together to ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to protect the safety of those using the markets in the borough.”Cllr Gregg McKeen said: “This is an important step in supporting our local economy during a dficult and uncertain time for all sectors.“With the correct social distancing and public health rules in place, the reopening of our outdoor weekly markets will be done safely and to the benefit of our borough.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3134145.jpg--.jpg?1590072730000\n","title":"wrightbus announces redundancies as it looks to secure its future","story":"Bus manufacturer Wrightbus has today announced a number of redundancies at its factory in Ballymena as it looks to create a stable and secure future for the company in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the tough decision has been taken to make up to  permanent employees redundant pending consultation, as well as a reduction in agency staff of up to  workers over a phased period that will be kept under review. The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

We were fortunate enough to have mummy and daddy at home with us and they didn#t die in hospital.But the sacrices we had to make, my sister couldn#t come to see them because she just had surgery to her ankle so she never got to see daddy and mummy before they died at all.When you#re Joe Bloggs and abide by the laws of the country you can#t do it.

I do worry about there being another mad outbreak in a couple of months as the rules soften.We buried a mummy and a daddy and I don#t think there#s any concept of how catastrophic their lives would bethe same thing happened to them - and I mean catastrophic.I was having lunch with my son there and I had to say to him that my head was still in a spin, nearly six weeks afterwards.Why is it that a Chief Medical Officer in Scotland had to be let go, but he stays because he#s the Prime Minister#s friend  He should be let go.Reacting to Mr Cumming#s Downing Street briefing, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his behaviour had critically undermined the Government#s public health message.For all the confusion in their approach, the Stay at Home message was not complex. No one could reasonably interpret that as giving a green light to travelling hundreds of miles to Durham and then travelling further to a beauty spot to test your eyesight, he said.This is now a test of this Conservative government. They have a simple question to answer - what is more important, saving Dominic Cummings job or saving lives  There is only one answer.He added that those separated from friends and family needed certainty their sacrices had not been made in vain.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

Photo by Peter MorrisonBy Mark BainMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt#s mid-afternoon on the end-of-May bank holiday and at the jewel in the Co Down coastline, the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea as they always have.A light dusting of dark cloud kisses the top of Slieve Donard as it towers high over Newcastle#s Donard Park.But today the cars are snaking past the entrance rather than going in to take on what would normally be a vain quest to find a parking spot.There#s a sharp breeze along the seafront, a suspicion of rain in the air, but since when has that ever put people off trying to spend their bank holiday Monday ambling along to the soundtrack of the waves rolling in, treating the kids to an ice cream or stick of rock and taking in the amusements But there#s little joy to be found in Joyland today. The shutters are firmly down.The cars pass by along the main street of the town but most don#t stop. They come, they see nothing to do, they pass on by.Perhaps they were expecting more  But in these times of lockdown, although now with slightly relaxed restrictions, all you can do is queue for an ice cream or a snack at one of the parlours open along the street.There#s a sense of desperation in the air. The families have come, desperate to entertain the children, relieved to be out of the confines of home, but they#ve found little in the way of amusement. Cyclists have a free run along the footpaths. People jog on by unimpeded.Even the front of the Newcastle Centre, which is normally lined with scores of motorcycles as leather-clad riders enjoy traditional May bank holiday runs to the coast, is barren. Only a few bikes are parked up. The rest trickle by. They have come in hope and left in disappointment that things, quite simply, aren#t how they used to be.From the bridge over the Shimna River in the heart of the town, a solitary family sit below on the sandy beach as the children play. Social distancing doesn#t matter as there#s no one to socially distance from today.Sunday, from all accounts, was a dferent story. Long queues of cars lined up to get into the town as families gathered to enjoy the clear blue skies and sunshine, despite warnings from health officials and police that they should act responsibly and reasonably over the holiday weekend.Perhaps, by Monday afternoon, word had got around that getting out of the car in one of the local seaside resorts wasn#t worth the effort.And shorn of the usual caravan owners, with the gates locked at the Mourneview park on the main road into town, there was plenty of room for the few willing to break free from home for the day to stroll around town at their leisure.And as they stretched their legs they did so under the watchful eye of the PSNI, a police car stationed outside an ice cream parlour as a reminder of the times we#re living in.Leaving town, the threatened rain starts to fall. A day that many began in the hope that some things were starting to move back towards a normal way of le hadn#t moved as much as they had wanted.

His work is currently part of collections held in Dublin, London, Poland, America, Japan and South Korea. He also has work on show at the Imperial War Museum.His postcard drawings will each have a title and explanation on the back and will be simply signed #Nicholl#.He explains: The drawings on the postcards and envelopes are based on places both of us have visited and loved.I plan to open an old phone book and stick a pin on the page and wherever it lands, that is the address I will use.I can only hope when people receive them that they don#t think, #What is this load of old crap # and throw them out.The drawings have been inspired by artwork and places he and Elaine have seen while on their regular travels through the museums of Europe.He adds: This is an unimaginable nightmare people are going through and it is the good things people are doing for one another that have moved me so much.I don#t plan to be the Bangor Banksy which is why I have put my surname on the postcards and who knows, maybe in years to come, when I am long gone, they could be worth something I will be posting them in the next few weeks andthey survive, that#s great andthey don#t, then that#s fine, too. Hopefully some people will appreciate them.When his  cards are complete, Leslie hopes to create a new collection of paintings based on the cards for an exhibition to be held when galleries are finally able to reopen.

One department may reach that limit as early as June .Mr Murphy explained that,Department of Finance was to follow the usual budget timeline, departments would simply run out of money before final budget estimates can be approved.In order to avoid this scenario, the minister brought forward a motion to allow departments to continue to spend money until detailed budget estimates can be debated later in the year.One department under increasing financial pressure is the Department for Infrastructure, in particular NI Water.Speaking in the Assembly earlier, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the water and sewerage provider is facing a funding crisis as a direct result of the Covid- pandemic.NI Water provides vital services across Northern Ireland and ensuring that is financially support is not only vital to NI Water#s future, but it is critical for protecting our communities, she said.It#s important to look at the facts. Firstly, businesses have closed due to the Covid- restrictions, leading to a funding gap in NI Water of £m. Secondly, despite the fall in business use, demand for water has increased overall during lockdown, as we are using more water at home.Sewer blockages have also increased with more wet wipes being flushed down drains and NI Water has also had to change its working practices to keep frontline workers safe. All of this means they are incurring extra costs.Ms Mallon added that NI Water has been unable to avail of the business support provided to private business by the government due to the pandemic.Months before the coronavirus outbreak took hold, NI Water was already facing financial dficulties, warning in January that it needs at least £.bn to address capacity issues and to continue providing essential water and wastewater services.Belfast Most ReadFamily of murdered Belfast man Kieran Wylie crave justice, priest tells funeralWhy Derry Girls actress was in tears after Channel  staff saw her working in pub at Christmas partyCoronavirus: Northern Ireland retail shops to get go-ahead to reopen soon#I broke no laws# - Taoiseach defends picnic with friends after public were discouraged from doing soBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Routines have generally been disrupted so they haven#t been getting out as much during the day. If people are working at home, there isn#t the same change of position as there would bethey were in their normal work area, such as simple things like walking to meet a colleague or going to the canteen for lunch.With that routine gone, it#s very dficult for people to exercise as normal.Health experts have long warned that people who spend long hours in front of the computer are at a higher risk of developing injuries in both the upper and lower body. Fionnuala said one key area for those working from home is ensuring their computer or laptop is always at eye level, eventhat means having it raised up on books. She added: Really,people can work from a table they should and change their position regularly. Their elbows should be at  degrees and feet flat on the floor.It#s best not to sit on a sofa when working butthere#s no alternative then use cushions to improve posture.When setting up a work station at home, people should move often and take plenty of mini-breaks so that they don#t sit for too long at any one time, be it making a cup of coffee, going to the bathroom or taking a short walk around their house or garden.Fionnuala has a similar message around staying active for the elderly or vulnerable who are shielding at this time.There are a lot of people with conditions like arthritis who will be finding their affected joints stfer because they are staying in one position for too long.If your posture is poor, your back and neck are vulnerable to injury and staying in a bad position for too long can also impact on your mood. Staying inside for too long and not being outdoors can equally affect your sleep and energy levels.A lot of the patients we are treating at the minute say that being stuck at home means they can#t get the exercise they need to help manage the symptoms of their condition.If we can get people to set things up quite well for themselves while at home and move regularly, we may prevent new problems arising further down the line and assist those with pre-existing issues who are trying to manage their symptoms.With gyms currently closed, Fionnuala said walking is the easiest and most inexpensive activity for people of all ages to do as part of their daily exercise, and she has warned against doing too much too soon when facilities reopen again, to avoid injuries.Advice, tips and tools to help you make the best choices about your health and wellbeing can be found at www.nhs.uk live-wellFionnuala#s top tips for staying well:l Move regularly in any way you can.l Try to take some exercise daily .l Check your workstation.l Connect with friends family by phone or social media.l Eat healthy, well balanced meals, stay well hydrated and get plenty of sleep.

There is always something  to strum their inner desire. When the euphoria subsides, satisfaction seeps in and before you know it, the mind starts to wander to the next target. In the case of World Record breaking father and son duo Tommy and Eoin Hughes, they are the perfect example. When the next Guinness Book of Records peels off the press, their time of four hours,  minutes and  seconds from last Octobers Frankfurt marathon will have etched their names into the realms of greatness. But they are not content with their lot, they are focussed on smashing it again, this time with a result that will warn off any would-be challengers. googletag.cmd.push By the time Tommy joined last Wednesday mornings zoom meeting he had his customary early morning -mile run done. Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

The virtual race around the world challenge will see the club travel across the globe with the miles logged by members each week. Like most things in the current climate, the challenge is virtual and is carried out in accordance with current guidelines and regulations. Nevertheless, it has provided a great opportunity for the Harriers to connect, have a common goal and log some eco-friendly air miles. The club challenge has seen Harriers collectively run a total of  miles. This has seen the club cross Europe, Asia and beyond. Currently we are navigating our way through Oceania, as we run along the Southern coastline of Australia from Perth to Sydney. googletag.cmd.push Club chairperson Maureen Mallon commented, “No one ever expected this year to be so strange, scary and stressful. To keep the running community’s spirit up, the virtual running round the world is, in my opinion, the best way to try and keep members motivated. The best part of it is that it doesn’t matter who does what miles, speed, or how the miles are done it’s about members getting out. We all know the benefits of exercise both physically and mentally and it’s good to have something to focus on. No one knows when we will get back to group training or racing so for now it’s about supporting each other and working towards our virtual goal.” googletag.cmd.push Soon the club will head to New Zealand and then on to South America. From the start of the challenge around  members have participated. For some members, the break from racing has provided the perfect time to build a solid training base for future races. Whereas for others, the priority is to get out and get some fresh air. Nevertheless, the club is connected by this common goal. Joe Curry’s Marathon fundraiser Spring time marathons, for many, are the climax of months of hard graft and training. Unfortunately, events such as the London and Belfast marathons have not taken place this year. However, Joe Curry made sure his winter training would not be wasted. Back in April, the Cookstown man ran the landmark distance of . miles in his back garden! Joe ran  laps of his garden to raise funds for The Intensive Care Society. To date he has raised nearly pound. Joe paid tribute to NHS staff, saying his past marathon and ultramarathon exploits would be easy in comparison to the challenges of frontline workers. Mental Health Week The club was proud to support mental health week. It’s no understatement to say that for many, running provides an opportunity to escape le’s problems. The exercise and club comradery is a great setting for members to help boost their mental health. The club’s welfare officer, Briege McCann reaffirms the club’s position to support the mental well being of the club’s members. She said, “Mental Health week is a great opportunity to pause and reflect, not just to look after ourselves, but all around. Sperrin Harriers is much more than just a running club, but a community where each member is highly valued.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The virtual race around the world challenge will see the club travel across the globe with the miles logged by members each week. Like most things in the current climate, the challenge is virtual and is carried out in accordance with current guidelines and regulations. Nevertheless, it has provided a great opportunity for the Harriers to connect, have a common goal and log some eco-friendly air miles. The club challenge has seen Harriers collectively run a total of  miles. This has seen the club cross Europe, Asia and beyond. Currently we are navigating our way through Oceania, as we run along the Southern coastline of Australia from Perth to Sydney. googletag.cmd.push Club chairperson Maureen Mallon commented, “No one ever expected this year to be so strange, scary and stressful. To keep the running community’s spirit up, the virtual running round the world is, in my opinion, the best way to try and keep members motivated. The best part of it is that it doesn’t matter who does what miles, speed, or how the miles are done it’s about members getting out. We all know the benefits of exercise both physically and mentally and it’s good to have something to focus on. No one knows when we will get back to group training or racing so for now it’s about supporting each other and working towards our virtual goal.” googletag.cmd.push Soon the club will head to New Zealand and then on to South America. From the start of the challenge around  members have participated. For some members, the break from racing has provided the perfect time to build a solid training base for future races. Whereas for others, the priority is to get out and get some fresh air. Nevertheless, the club is connected by this common goal. Joe Curry’s Marathon fundraiser Spring time marathons, for many, are the climax of months of hard graft and training. Unfortunately, events such as the London and Belfast marathons have not taken place this year. However, Joe Curry made sure his winter training would not be wasted. Back in April, the Cookstown man ran the landmark distance of . miles in his back garden! Joe ran  laps of his garden to raise funds for The Intensive Care Society. To date he has raised nearly pound. Joe paid tribute to NHS staff, saying his past marathon and ultramarathon exploits would be easy in comparison to the challenges of frontline workers. Mental Health Week The club was proud to support mental health week. It’s no understatement to say that for many, running provides an opportunity to escape le’s problems. The exercise and club comradery is a great setting for members to help boost their mental health. The club’s welfare officer, Briege McCann reaffirms the club’s position to support the mental well being of the club’s members. She said, “Mental Health week is a great opportunity to pause and reflect, not just to look after ourselves, but all around. Sperrin Harriers is much more than just a running club, but a community where each member is highly valued.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

This is due to a “lack of clarity” in the liquor licensing laws. According to a report in the The , Garda Headquarters has sought legal advice on pubs delivering drinks and selling takeaway beverages from their premises and has been told that both practices do not contravene liquor licensing laws. The report stated that “as long as drinks, including poured pints, are paid for on a licensed premises they can be delivered to customers.” And it added that takeaway sales are also permitted once those buying drinks in that manner consume them more than  metres away from a pub and not in a public place. googletag.cmd.push In effect, it means that pubs can operate delivery and off-sales as an “essential service” during the lockdown, like supermarkets, pharmacies, hardware stores and some other businesses. Last week, the a case of O’Flaherty’s Pubin Buncrana made headlines as it was running the “Guinness Express”.  It was forced to half deliveries after gardaiacute called to the premises. Pints of Guinness had been wrapped in cling film for delivery purposes. At the time a spokesman for the pub complained gardaiacute were unable to tell him what laws staff had broken. Now, it has emerged that after the legal advice received in recent days, such deliveries will be possible once the drinks are paid for in advance to a person on a pub’s premises. googletag.cmd.push For the full articleSEE HERE   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

The patients always comment on the beautul setting and views we have over the Foyle Bridge. A spokesperson for the hospice described Yvonne as an amazing woman who has been a large part of the hospice for the past  years.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him.

He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point.Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling. – Brian Oacuteg McGilliganBrian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch.He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg HinpheyOne of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career.He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square.

Air Ambulance NI is a service we certainly never thought we would ever need but we will always be very grateful to the team who attended to Conor.ldquoWe are encouraging all our family, friends and the community to come along and get involved ndash itrsquoll be a challenge but a great day out.John added: ldquoPlease support this service and help ensure the HEMS is available for other families in the future should they need it.The challenge is taking place during the national Air Ambulance Month.Air Ambulance NI are asking people to register at airambulanceni.org upcoming-events to climb Slemish in Co Antrim on September , Cuilcagh in Co Fermanagh on September  and Slieve Donard on September .Kerry Anderson, Air Ambulance NI head of fundraising, said: ldquoFor the first time, a virtual challenge has been created for walkers to complete from the comfort of their own home.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These changes are becoming more apparent when extreme weather events increase and sea levels rise.ldquoUsing ground-based survey technology, we can study relatively rapid changes in the movements of beach sands on this site.ldquoResearch to date has shown the once golden beach at the promenade at Newcastle have over the past few decades been pushed down the coast toward Ballykinlar through wave and tidal action.ldquoWith increased storm events we are studying how this may present itself in the near future.Professor Jackson added: ldquoAs well as past and present movements, we are examining future scenarios of how heightened sea levels at the site will alter the coastline dynamics.ldquoWe are using Murlough Bay as a test bed for establishing coastal monitoring protocols for other sites in the region. These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

Please try again later.Submitting...Despite receiving multiple awards around the world, before Adrian McKinty started writing his latest bestseller The Chain, he was struggling to make ends meet and had decided to work as an Uber driver. Persuaded by fellow author Don Winslow to give it a final shot, Adrian started on what would later become The Chain – a terrying thriller that sees parents forced to kidnap children to save their own – for which Paramount Pictures has acquired the screen rights.Explaining how an old school teacher was the inspiration for the book the -year-old said: “I know a lot of people just think chain letters are silly, but I remember when I was a kid they scared the wits out of me. “People would say, ‘make three copies of this and send it on or your mother will die’. I thought better safe than sorry, I’ll make three copies of this and send it on.“When I was at Victoria Primary School in Carrick my P teacher was this woman called Mrs Carlisle. This was in the late s. These chain letters had been going around for a long time. She heard about it and askedanyone in the class had been getting chain letters and was really worried about it. Most of the class put their hand up. She said, ‘bring them all to me tomorrow’. “We all brought them to her, she took us outside, put them all into a bonfire and said, ‘I will take all the bad luck and all the hexes and stop these chains now’. Then she set fire to all the letters. I just remember I could not believe it. I thought, ‘well, we won’t be seeing her again’.“It made a huge impression on me as a kid when you’re so vulnerable and impressionable. “I remember any time I was away I’d always say to my mum when I got back, ‘how’s Mrs Carlisle doing ’ expecting to hear something out of The Omen, some news of a grizzly death, but no, she’s still alive, living in Trooperslane to this very day.“My mum gave her a signed copy of the book. She knows she was the big inspiration for the book.”After leaving school in NI Adrian went to Oxford University on a full scholarship to study philosophy before emigrating to the USA to become a high school English teacher. Normally Adrian’s book are set in Northern Ireland, however The Chain takes place in Boston: “I wanted it to be set in America for a couple of reasons. I wanted the main character to be able to buy a gun.“Also, the only part of America I really know well is Boston. That’s where my we is from.“I like my books to be very accurate. You want somewhere where you’re familiar with, you’ve walked the streets, you don’t make mistakes. You know the smells and the colours and the textures. You don’t want to have to Google details.”Before The Chain he was best known for his DS Sean Duffy series set in s Northern Ireland: “To me it was a no brainerI’m going to write a detective series set in the s, what do I know really well – Belfast and Carrick. I knew what was on the radio, what was on TV, what people were eating, what they were driving. For me to write about London or New York in the s I’d just be guessing.”Of the movie prospects for The Chain, Adrian said: “Whether that becomes a film or not I don’t know. Fingers crossed. One of my previous books was optioned – Dead I Well May Be – they renewed the option  times, every year for  years then they didn’t make the film.”Adrian’s books have won the Edgar Award, the Ned Kelly Award, the Anthony Award, the Barry Award and have been translated into over  languages. The Chain was recently longlisted for the Theakston Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year. He faces tough competition in four former champions Denise Mina, Chris Brookmyre, Val McDermid and Lee Child, with the public voting now open to help determine the shortlist, which will be announced on June .Asked whether sales or awards were more important, Adrian said: “I suppose ultimately it’s selling copies of the books over awards. You have to be able to make a living out of this racket. I had a few years where I was winning crime fiction awards but only selling a couple of thousands copies of my books a year.“At a dollar a book that’s about two grand a year. You just can’t live on that no harm to you.”Discussing his decision to quit writing he said: “People have said to me, ‘you should never give up your dreams, you’re a bad example’. People have gone after me a wee bit, but I feel like I gave it a good go. “For eight or nine years I dedicated myself to being a writer. The books were coming out, they were getting good reviews. “My problem was they were set in Belfast during the Troubles, that was a hard sell. People would read the back and say, ‘I’ve had enough of all that nonsense’.“Getting people in England to buy those books was really dficult. It was even worse in America. For a lot of American readers their view of Ireland is The Quiet Man. The stuff I was writing about – RUC vs the IRA, Protestants vs Catholics, bombings, shooting, raids – was really interesting to me but perplexing for American readers.”He said: “I think the break helped. It gave me a time to think about new ideas and new concepts. I started thinking about my childhood at Victoria Primary School, growing up in Carrick, and that’s where The Chain came from.”Coronavirus literatureAskedhe thinks there will soon be a wave of novels set against a backdrop of the Covid- pandemic and lockdown, Adrian said: “There’s two ways of thinking about it.“After the  epidemic , in , , Charlie Chaplin didn’t start making a lot of lockdown movies. They were basically the same films that he was making before.“You look at the writing – you have Ulyssesand The Waste Land– they weren’t about what was happening in that period.“It just could go on the same as it always has. People don’t want to think about.”He continued: “Another way of thinking about it is, it’s such an interesting topic, everybody is going through it. Somebody is going to have to write something about it.“I was thinking to myself it is actually quite interesting for a crime writer. I’ve written a few locked room mysteries in my early career.“I really like the idea of someone being murdered in a locked room, during lockdown, while everyone  is in a locked room in lockdown as well. What could be more delicious than that ”Also discussed during our interview was the idea of a serial killer at work during lockdown.Adrian said: “I remember reading a book about a serial killer during the Blitz. It was the perfect crime because so many people were being killed by bombing every night what’s another body lying on the street.“That might work for Covid too. What’s one more little old lady dead when the police are already overstretched ”Least productive timePeople who think writers will have found it easy to adopt a stay at home regime during lockdown are way off the mark according to Adrian.He said: “I haven’t really been out of the house for about six weeks, but what  can you do, you have to obey the orders, stay inside.“I’m in New York, I’ve been here about two years. Up until the last six weeks it seemed like a great idea, now we’re stuck inside a tiny, wee apartment for two months it’s getting a bit claustrophobic.“It’s the funniest thing, this has probably been the least productive two months in the past  years.“Both kids are home all the time, you’re homeschooling them and helping them with their online homework and stuff like that. “They’re bored out of their minds so you’re playing Cluedo, Monopoly, and at the end of a day of really doing nothing you’re just exhausted.“I don’t really understand it to be perfectly honest. Normally I’d go to bed at about midnight or one. By  o’clock I’m just beat. Another day’s over, you go to bed, get up and it’s the same thing all over again.“It used to be I’d go out and do a really long walk every day, four days a week I’d go to the gym, go for a swim or whatever. “I’ve been doing none of that, yet I’m exhausted all the time.“For the first month I was feeling really guilty about it. I was saying to myself, ‘Adrian, you’re wasting your le, son, you should be getting up at six, getting the work done before the kids get up’. I was really beating myself up.“Then I was emailing with a whole bunch of friends and everybody was telling me the same story. They’re not getting anything done and are just really exhausted.“Somebody on Twitter posted that they’ve used this time really well, they’ve learned French. I unfollowed them immediately. The rest of us are stuffing our faces with pizza and watching TV and you’re learning French – give me a break.”He added: “When this lockdown is over the first thing I’m going to do is go to the pub, the second thing is get a haircut. I look like I’ve been living in the jungle for five years. If there’s some hipster haircut place that also sells beer I’m going there.“If you’d asked someone six months ago what they wanted to do, what their aspirations were, they’d maybe have said they want to go skiing or run a marathon. Ask me now, I want to get a pint in the pub and haircut.”Sadly for Adrian, he doesn’t think he will be able to visit home this summer: “I go home every summer to check on my mum and stay for a while. I don’t knowthat will be possible this year.”Adrian’s late father worked at Harland and Wolff while his mum worked as a secretary. He has other family members who still live in Carrick, and some further afield.He said: “It might have to be Christmas instead. I love to get back and see everyone. It’s a real shameI can’t this year.”One elf is enoughAdrian lives in New York with his we Leah and his daughters Sophie and Arwynn.Arwynn’s name is based on a Lord Of The Rings character due to the fact Adrian and his we met in the Oxford pub that author JRR Tolkien used to frequent. “When Sophie was born I wanted to call her Eowyn , but Leah wouldn’t let me. She said we’ve got one elf in the family and that’s enough. She’s named after her grandmother.”Loosehead prop for Jerusalem LionsAdrian explained how he ended up playing rugby for Jerusalem’s local rugby team when his we was there on a year’s scholarship.He recalled: It said on the scholarship that neither you or your partner is allowed to work. For the first couple of months I was just walking around the city enjoying Jerusalem, then I saw this poster for this rugby team – the Jerusalem Lions. I thought, ‘well I’m bored out of my mind here, I’ll go along to their training’.“I think a lot of them had never played rugby before because I immediately made the first team after the first training session. I spent that year playing loosehead prop for the Jerusalem Lions. We travelled all over Israel, Egypt and up into Lebanon.

Wersquove got the capacity to do it.Matthew went on to describe the atmosphere at Llandough Hospital.ldquoWersquore both in Penarth and wersquove lived here all our lives. Its important to us that we support it as much as possible.ldquoIts uplting being able to do that. It was so emotional being able to see the nurses on the Covid ward.ldquoFor me and Charlotte it was very humbling because those guys are putting their lives at risk and theyrsquore asking for stuff for patients, not for themselves.ldquoWe were quite tearful because we didnrsquot want to leave them there ndash but theyrsquore doing it day in-day out without batting an eyelid. Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One,

Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

I can announce that we have now signed contracts to manufacture two billion items of PPE here in the UK.ldquoAround the world, wersquove signed deals with over  new suppliers including agreeing contracts for a further . billion gloves.ldquoWhile we continue to improve the logistics and work hard to get everyone, the PPE that they need these new supplies mean that wersquore not simply keeping up with demand, we are now able to begin to replenish our stockpiles.ldquoThere is a lot further to go on PPE, as on so many things, but we have made signicant progress, and Irsquod like to thank everybody involved.ldquoPPE of course is so important, because itrsquos about protecting the people who protect us. And wersquoll do that for as long as the virus remains on these shores. vw,vw,px, px\"Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock Later in the briefing, Mr Hancock was asked about NHS staff not being properly ldquofit tested for PPE.He said: ldquoI know there was some problems with that at the start, I hope wersquove resolved them now. It was all going from needing normal amounts of PPE to needing very high amounts of PPE.Issues with PPE have been one of the major issues during the pandemic.Supply chains around the world broke down as the pandemic took hold in each country. vw, px\"Doctor Abdul Mabud Chowdhury In the UK, desperate staff described how they were left in tears over shortages, with some being forced to buy their own equipment online and others ldquohiding gear in hospital to ensure they had enough for their next sht.The Government has faced heavy criticism on the issue, particularly over the death of a doctor who died after warning about a lack of the equipment.Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury died in April after being diagnosed with Covid-. Five days before he was admitted to hospital, Dr Chowdhury, , wrote a Facebook post asking Prime Minister Boris Johnson to urgently provide every NHS worker with PPE.Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said: ldquoSince the pandemic began, there have been considerable dficulties around PPE, including accessing particular items such as gowns, and the withdrawal of Tiger Eye goggles. The stockpile in the UK was clearly not fit for a coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHowever, we recognise that this has been a huge logistical challenge to not only secure kit whilst there is huge global demand, but also operationally to deliver it to the front line.ldquoIt is good to see progress is being made in signing contracts with suppliers for equipment produced here in the UK, as well as securing  new suppliers overseas.ldquoTrusts have also been playing their part in securing more supplies. For example, therersquos been an initiative in the north east involving Barbour who have used their factory in South Shields to make gowns for a range of trusts in the surrounding area..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PPE stockpile to be replenished, Matt Hancock says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
