[{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard joined girl squad night town just hours end Johnny Depp trial","story":"Share this articleWhile Depp was absent yesterday, Heard did attend, and was pictured smiling alongside girlfriend Bianca Butti, before waving at awaiting fans outside the Royal Courts of Justice.  Ms Wass said there was \u0027overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, cataloged over a three-year period.\u0027 She said Depp was \u0027a hopeless addict who repeatedly lost his self-control and all ability to restrain his anger.\u0027\u0027Permeating all of the evidence in this case is the character of Mr. Depp himself - his well-documented evidence of violence and destruction over his adult life which have occurred when he was under the influence of drink and drugs.\u0027Ms Wass added that Depp \u0027was subject to irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioral patterns, which would not have been present when Mr. Depp was clean and sober, and Mr. Depp has a name for this metamorphosed entity - namely, The Monster.\u0027She said: \u0027The other aspect which is important in terms of substance abuse is Mr Depp\u0027s recollection of his own disgraceful conduct, which is so severely impaired by drug misuse that he may not even have been aware of the extent of his violence and terrifying behaviour which, on more than one of these pleaded incidents, put Ms Heard in fear of her life.\u0027Depp and Heard met on the set of the 2011 comedy \u0027The Rum Diary\u0027 and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Joe Bidens speech notes included praiseworthy notes Kamala Harris","story":"Share this articleFalse alarm: Politico \u0027technical error\u0027 identifies Kamala Harris as Biden VP pick"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/0C068B1800000578-5548741-Kate_and_Gerry_McCann_mark_the_fourth_anniversary_of_the_disappe-m-2_1524816157149.jpg","title":"Madeleine McCann investigators resume digging German allotment","story":"Share this articleShare this articleFall Maddie: Polizei setzt Spurensuche in Garten bei Hannover fortFall Maddie in Hannover: Ermittler finden Keller auf Gartengelände - News Inland - Bild.de"},{"url":null,"title":"Oldham overtakes lockdown Leicester highest second coronavirus infection rate England","story":"Share this articleExplained: What caused Oldham\u0027s new coronavirus crisis, where are the spikes in infection rates and how will the town get out of this? - Manchester Evening NewsManchester Evening News: Number one for news, opinion, sport \u0026amp celebrity gossip"},{"url":null,"title":"Bakery turns away customers aged 94 86 didnt cards wanted pay cash","story":"Share this article Ms Clarke added: \u0027If they have not got a card unfortunately we can\u0027t give them the goods.

For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Biographer AN Wilson shares his favourite booksThe novels are unlike any other writer’s. People have likened them to poems, to visions, to pantomime, and they are all these things. If you want to see how different he was to all his contemporaries, just try to imagine George Eliot or Thackeray or the Brontë sisters doing those reading tours, when thousands of people, the poor in multitudes, came to hear him. Nothing like it had been seen since John Wesley’s preaching tours.There have been thousands of books on Dickens. I wanted, nevertheless, in The Mystery of Charles Dickens to set down some of my lifelong obsession with his work. One thing I wanted to winkle out, if I could, was the relationship between the life and the work. Something much more complicated was going on than with most novelists, all of whom take versions of their own lives and turn them into fiction. At a much deeper level than most, Dickens was confronting his own demons – the wretched childhood, the appalling relations with women – and turning them into melodrama, tragedy, farce, burlesque. That sense we all flickeringly retain of our childhood self watching the behaviour of the baffling and often scary grownups – that sense in him was hyper-developed, and it is what turbocharged the books.1. Selected Journalism 1850-1870 (edited by David Pascoe) It might seem paradoxical to start my list with the journalism, but Dickens began as a journalist and he never stopped being one. While pursuing a life as a prolific novelist, tireless charity worker, fairly frequent actor, Dickens kept up weekly journalism, and edited two of his own periodicals, Household Words and All the Year Round. Try reading A Nightly Scene in London from 1856, in which Dickens takes us to Whitechapel, where he finds five bundles of old rags thrown down by the walls of the workhouse. The bundles turn out to be women, of course. One of his strongest pieces. Or read Lying Awake, the justly famous account of the joint public hanging of the Mannings, a married pair of murderers.2. Sketches By BozAgain, journalism, but journalism morphing into the fiction. He took the name Boz from his brother Augustus’s nickname. Published the year before Victoria became queen, and written when he was in his early 20s, it is so vivid, so warm, so comic, so passionate. London Recreations, whose title is self-explanatory, is not merely descriptive. It contains that hatred of busybodydom and evangelical humbug that burst out in a more mature essay for Household Words, The Great Baby – the baby being the public, patronised by Those Who Know Best.3. American Notes A better account of the young Dickens’s take on the US than the one novel I’d deem a failure, Martin Chuzzlewit. He visited America’s prisons, saw its great landscapes, appreciated its hospitality and open-heartedness. But he could not stick the evangelical Christianity. “Wherever religion is resorted to, as a strong drink, and as an escape from the dull monotonous round of home, those of its ministers who pepper the highest will be surest to please. They who strew the Eternal Path with the greatest amount of brimstone, and who most ruthlessly tread down the flowers and leaves that grow by the wayside, will be voted the most righteous”.4. A Christmas Carol In many ways this, the most famous of all his books, is his best. Christmas was central to his world-vision that simply trying to be a little kinder to one another both as iniduals and as a society might be an experiment worth trying. If, reading these words, you have never tried a book by Dickens, I’d recommend starting with the famous story of how Scrooge was converted from a belief in money and power into someone who saw the power of love. The fact that it is set in the form of a fairytale is a good preparation for the longer fiction all of which, at its most successful, possesses some of the power of such stories.5. David CopperfieldHis own personal favourite among the novels. A book that can make me – and millions of others – weep and laugh out loud, often on the same page. A sort of autobiography, but one in which all his family have been expunged. David’s father is dead before the book begins, his mother dies when he is still very young. And unlike Dickens, David has no siblings. The awful woes and cruelties for which in real life he blamed his parents are the fault of the wicked stepfather Mr Murdstone. This book has some of Dickens’s finest characters – Mr Dick, Mr Micawber, Betsey Trotwood – and, in the storm that engulfs the Suffolk coast, one of his most powerful descriptions of nature.6. Great ExpectationsIf Copperfield was a rather benign version of his autobiography, here he takes the gloves off. The person he is beating up is himself. Pip believes he has inherited wealth from the sinister Miss Havisham, the rich woman of Rochester, whereas in fact the source of his wealth is the convict, Magwitch, to whom as a child Pip had shown kindness. The mistake which Pip finds so shattering reveals, to him and to us, all his skewed values, all his cult of wealth and status. Technically the most flawless of the fictions, and one that makes for truly uncomfortable reading.7. Little DorritIn Copperfield, Dickens’s improvident father was depicted in the benign, comical figure of Mr Micawber, whose spells in the debtors’ gaol are a kind of joke. In Little Dorrit, the actual experience of Mr Dickens senior in the Marshalsea prison fed into one the most powerful of all his mature works. Equally terrible, presumably because it was unconscious on Dickens’s part, is his expression of profound mother-hatred in the figure of Mrs Clennam, the power-mad businesswoman exercising control from the darkened sick-room of her tottering house. An amazing masterpiece. 8. Bleak HouseAnother great masterpiece. One of the things that overpowered me, as I reread and reread Dickens in preparation for my book, was how he confronted and analysed the sheer beastliness of the 19th century. In this book, famously, he satirised the slow, corrupt processes of the law and the high court of Chancery, but really, when you read of the death of Little Jo the Crossing Sweeper or listen to the slow drip-drip-drip of boredom and rain at the aristocrat’s house, or work out the tangles of the plot through the life and death of society solicitor Mr Tulkinghorn, you realise that it is the 19th century itself on trial, swathed, like London in November, in fogs of cruelty .9. The Old Curiosity ShopA relatively early one, and very like a fairytale or a panto. It contains some of his most vivid characters, not least Mr Quilp, a furious, crazy self-projection, which tells you much more about Dickens than does the rather vapid self-portrait in Copperfield. Quilp’s cruelty to his wife is, we now realise, all too true a portrait of his own behaviour as a husband to his harmless wife. The relationship between Little Nell and her gambling-addict grandfather, and their attempt to escape Quilp, leads us on a journey out of London, with vivid landscape and cityscape pictures of the nightmare that was Victorian England. One of his best.10. The Mystery of Edwin DroodIn the book he did not live to finish, he returns to the Rochester of his boyhood. It seems to be very VERY different from the others, not least because, as far as we can judge from remarks he made to friends and family, he intended to end it with a monologue by a convicted murderer who had committed his crime while under the influence of opium. But there are many theories about who killed Edwin Drood, or, indeed, whether he was killed. The book shows signs of Dickens’s weak health, and some of the chapters are as dead as anything he wrote. But there is a flare of genius, like the glory of sunset, in the pages he penned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28fae30f0fd5a89d2ba65285feb8bf6dac0180df/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=445c3ee8e05e75559332d4e3b55804fa","title":"aldi supermarket chain ready to take on 1200 new employees in uk","story":"Supermarket chain plans to open average of one new store a week before ChristmasAldi is to hire 1,200 new employees during the rest of this year, in a rare scrap of good news for jobseekers as the coronavirus pandemic forces many UK businesses to shed staff. The supermarket chain, which along with fellow German chain Lidl have been the fastest-growing UK supermarkets in recent years, plans to open an average of one new store a week between now and Christmas.“As much as the disruption of the past few months has been challenging, it has also reminded us that there are still hundreds of towns across the UK where shoppers don’t have access to Aldi’s award winning quality products and unbeatable prices,” said Giles Hurley, Aldi UK’s chief executive.“To continue doing this and meet our goals of making Aldi accessible to even more shoppers, we will need thousands more amazing colleagues across the country. I look forward to welcoming each and every one of them to the team.”Aldi said it would open new stores at locations including Sandhurst, Bristol and Edinburgh this year, and plans to create 1,200 extra roles before the end of 2020 as its expansion continues.The retailer, which has more than 890 stores and about 35,000 UK staff, said it had already created 2,800 new permanent jobs this year after grocery sales surged during the coronavirus pandemic.However, Aldi and Lidl have not enjoyed the same level of sales rises during the Covid-19 pandemic as rivals including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons, as they do not offer an online shopping service to customers.In May, Aldi struck a deal with takeaway courier service Deliveroo to offer a grocery home delivery service.\u0026nbspThe previous month Aldi launched a £24.99 grocery parcel service direct from its warehouses comprised of 22 essential products – such as rice, pasta, toilet rolls and tea – designed to help elderly and vulnerable shoppers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c6966186416a66674acf4d311995c70d86263c/0_283_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=7dc6fbbcbc3261fa0d82b601167b5e31","title":"covid 19 holidays home britain coronavirus","story":"What if sticking more closely to home than usual is not a bug but a deliberate feature of life in Britain after coronavirus?We swam with seals in a cold, green sea, hiked to waterfalls in the drizzle and ate hot chips on a harbour wall in the setting sun.The weather may not have been exactly tropical, but after months of being cooped up in lockdown, even a week in Northumberland felt wildly exotic, which in the circumstances is probably just as well. A summer of camping, cagoules and beach picnics eaten stoically behind a windbreak beckons for many, now that ministers are finally spelling out that any foreign travel in a pandemic is a gamble. And while my heart goes out to anyone whose Spanish holiday just went up in smoke or whose job in tourism now hangs in the balance, if nothing else, a stay-at-home summer is a chance to appreciate the beauty of what was always on our doorstep. The pandemic is shrinking horizons even faster and more bewilderingly than globalisation once expanded them. The question is whether that will have consequences well beyond the holidays.Could living, socialising and generally sticking rather closer to home than we have been used to become not a bug but a deliberate feature of a post-pandemic world? This idea lies at the heart of the 15-minute city movement, which argues for cutting out unnecessary car journeys and tackling climate change by ensuring city dwellers can work, shop, get the kids to school, hang out in the park and generally manage their everyday lives all within 15 minutes’ walk or cycle from their front doors. Melbourne has been experimenting with something similar for years now, while in Paris the pursuit of la ville du quart d’heure was a feature of mayor Anne Hidalgo’s re-election campaign last month. Variations of the same idea have emerged in cities from Ottawa to Detroit.But it’s the hunkered-down mood brought on by living with coronavirus that has really sparked interest in the idea of cities as a string of self-sufficient neighbourhoods, each with its own thriving high streets, affordable housing, jobs, green spaces and even communal vegetable gardens. The idea resonates with commuters, who have learned to love working from home during the pandemic, but also with people who liked getting to know their neighbours better in lockdown or who feel a new rush of loyalty towards local shops that sustained them through the worst. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has already signed up to a post-Covid-19 recovery strategy devised by the C40 group of city mayors worldwide, which includes 15-minute cities among its ideas. Even Boris Johnson’s new anti-obesity drive, with its emphasis on walking and cycling more, nods in the same direction, albeit for different reasons.It’s not about confining people to cramped, parochial lives – city dwellers will always be drawn to wherever the action is – and nor is it as twee as it may sound. If you live in villagey Dulwich or Didsbury, then you already have the artisan deli, the leafy park and the cafes full of freelancers hunched over laptops, which means a true 15-minute strategy would focus more on regenerating the grittier neighbourhoods lacking so much as a decent supermarket. Levelling up, you might call it. Yet instead the prime minister pleads with commuters to pick up the threads of their old lives, traipsing back to their city centre offices to help save jobs in Upper Crust or Pret a Manger.To be fair, the government has good reason to fear the economic consequences of an exodus from city centres. The middle-class fantasy of never having to go back to the office too often ignores the consequences for lower paid workers whose jobs relied on servicing these now unwanted commuter lifestyles. It’s not just coffee and sandwich shops: quit an office-based job, and you save on everything from suits to train tickets, childcare to drinks out after work. Multiply those inidual cutbacks thousands of time over and there must be consequences, not just for jobs but for public services. (How long would some bus and train routes around the country stay viable, stripped of rush-hour passengers?) But for as long as fear of infection lingers, Downing Street is fighting an uphill battle. It should be thinking instead about harnessing the new localism for the good of the planet, while helping businesses follow the money back out to the suburbs and market towns.For after months with nothing to spend it on, many higher earners have cash burning a hole in their pockets. The difference is, they’ll be drawn to spending it on services that go with the grain of their changed lives: hub workspaces, where lonely home workers can rent a desk alongside others, or cosy neighbourhood joints that make them feel comfortable about going out to eat again. They say all politics is local. Doing business in a post-Covid-19 world may depend on understanding how much of life now is, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd25aeaa1c301b235e2c6cfef6ace855ac395b47/0_190_4629_2777/master/4629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a10149b0bfaba71219c4adfdb965583","title":"my obsession with west brom has gone too far","story":"Ever since I was a boy, my happiness has depended on my football team’s success. That’s starting to seem foolishMy grandad took me to my first football match, on 27 April 1974. West Bromwich Albion drew with Luton Town 1-1. I have been a West Brom supporter ever since. As a kid, it caused me so much pain when we lost that I vividly recall looking forward to growing up, when it surely would not feel as bad. To my shame and discredit, it has got worse, reaching some kind of psychological nadir last week when we were promoted to the Premier League. That is how screwed up the whole thing has become in my head.If you are not into football you will be as baffled at this nonsense as you will be utterly uninterested in the details of the situation, but please bear with me. I will try to keep it simple: the teams finishing first and second in the Championship are promoted to the Premier League. For most of the season, West Brom were in first or second place. Then, with nine games to play, football stopped for lockdown. It was generally assumed (although not by me) that, if and when it resumed, we would remain in the top two and get promoted.However, Brentford FC went on an unbelievable run of eight consecutive wins, eventually, inexorably, whittling the gap between them in third, and us in second place, to one miserable point. So, in the 46th and final game of this 11-month season, we had to better Brentford’s score. We were playing QPR Brentford were playing Barnsley.The tension became so unbearable that I entered a dead-eyed, near-catatonic state, to the extent that my girlfriend occasionally prodded me to check that I was alive. Disastrously, QPR scored against us she looked at me in horror, but I registered no emotion. Neither did I register any emotion when Brentford also went a goal down, or when we equalised against QPR, or when we went ahead, or when QPR equalised to make it 2-2, or when Brentford then equalised against Barnsley. If Brentford had then scored again, as seemed inevitable, and we did not, which also seemed inevitable, we would be dropping out of the top two in the final minutes of the final game. I sank lower and lower into a real torpor. Then, incredibly, Barnsley scored and, to the joy of West Brom fans the world over, it was all going to be OK. But I remained emotionless. Seriously, I could not move.I have a close friend who likes football, but had never really had a team. As he had just moved to Brentford, he adopted them. By the end of the season, this became a problem for us. He attempted some friendly joshing by text, but I was having none of that from anyone, least of all a johnny-come-lately football fan like him. He then sent me a goading text at the final whistle of a critical defeat of my team. I sent him something back so vicious that I can’t share it here. When his team subsequently lost, I did not text him but, before long, he texted me: “I’m done with football. No more. Just look foolish.”In a matter of a few months he had gone from not being a fan, to a fan, to an emotionally committed fan, to an ex-fan. But setting that aside, I kept looking at the word “foolish”. After 46 years of becoming more and more obsessed with the fortunes of my team, I realised foolish is the right word. Whether winning or losing, I look foolish. It is not foolish to support a football team, but it is decidedly foolish to be so – as psychologists express it – fused with them. It is foolish, and somewhat shaming.My grocer, Richard, is a passionate Brentford fan of 30 years’ standing.

But we must not resign ourselves to a large-scale recurrence of coronavirus Is the brief respite over? In England, and other European nations hit hard by coronavirus, bars and cafes have reopened, and people have begun to fly abroad again for holidays. Guests have gathered for weddings. Babies have met their grandparents for the first time.Though many remain wary, the government’s keenness to get back to business has encouraged a dangerous sense of complacency some are increasingly casual in following the rules. Less than two weeks ago, Boris Johnson made the remarkable suggestion that there could be a “return to normality” by Christmas, with even distancing requirements dropped. Now the prime minister has warned there are signs of a second wave in Europe. Spain’s sharp rise in cases has already prompted England to reimpose quarantine for returning travellers it may soon do so for Belgium, Luxembourg and Croatia. Niall Dickson, who heads the NHS Confederation – representing NHS leaders – has told MPs that managers are very worried about a second spike, perhaps before winter, citing exhausted staff and the need to rebuild other services.Hong Kong, which has kept a relatively tight lid on infections until now, is on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak, according to its chief executive, which could lead to the collapse of the hospital system. Vietnam – which has so far recorded no deaths – reported its first case for three months at the weekend now it is bracing for a surge after dozens more in multiple locations.Others have seen no pause. The US reopening was vastly premature – as 4 million confirmed cases and a death toll of 150,000 attest. In India and Brazil, the virus is flourishing. Though some poorer countries have put wealthy nations to shame with exemplary initial responses, coronavirus will wreak its most devastating damage in communities with overcrowded conditions, poor sanitation and healthcare, malnutrition and no social safety net.The global picture underscores that we are not, in truth, facing a new wave, but a continuation or resurgence: the pandemic is “one big wave”, says World Health Organization spokesperson Margaret Harris. But she also made it clear that, while it might be accelerating, it is not an inexorable force sweeping all before it. It can and must be flattened.Another worldwide lockdown is neither possible nor desirable, given its costs. But the alternative is not resignation, abandoning the most vulnerable to take their chances. It is for governments to redouble efforts. They must work together, and encourage their citizens to pull together.One hope is that governments and communities are better prepared for a resurgence thanks to the test and trace strategies they have developed, and increased public awareness of how to reduce the risk of infection. Another is that they are learning from what they and others got wrong the first time round. The UK’s failure to protect care homes saw them “thrown to the wolves”, in the words of the public accounts committee. In Hong Kong, the president of the medical association has criticised the high level of exemptions from quarantine.But if Mr Johnson is as concerned as he says, it is baffling that the government wants to urge people who can work remotely back into workplaces, and is still encouraging people to book holidays. Two epidemiologists have suggested the UK could eliminate coronavirus if it stops overseas tourism. The threat of a resurgence is all the more reason for England and Wales to seriously consider the Independent Sage group’s “Zero Covid” approach, already adopted by Scotland and Northern Ireland.With no vaccine yet available, a sensible government would pause the relaxation of restrictions while it takes stock, and discourage people from holidaying abroad as cases grow. It would clarify guidelines to make them more understandable, and throw itself into effective social media campaigns to remind people of the difference that mask wearing, proper distancing and handwashing make. Meanwhile, it would ensure that it has adequate supplies of protective gear, medical equipment and the necessary medicines. Iniduals, too, must do their part by following official advice. England should have been better prepared for coronavirus to hit in spring. It has no excuses this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd58a4b127da5e72696518161d8a9a974ef171b/0_523_6234_3740/master/6234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89fad98c6b0a2bc5abdc8a4c06875f3d","title":"spuds you like potato photographer of the year in pictures","story":"The inaugural Potato Photographer of the Year prize has gone to a potato getting a lockdown haircut.

Following a summer in the life of a 10-year-old who’s recently moved to a new neighbourhood, the film won acclaim (and criticism, when it was included in the curriculum in French schools) around the world for its depiction of a child experimenting outside gender norms, and has built up a steady fanbase ever since.But it was never released in South Korea – at least, not until Portrait of a Lady on Fire swept the country’s box office earlier this year to the tune of nearly 150,000admissions, becoming the most successful French film in Korea for more than five years. After that success, Tomboy was released on 14 May, and at time of writing, has had over 30,000 admissions, and tens of thousands of Instagram posts using the hashtag 톰보이 (literally Tomboi in Korean).This isn’t just a one-off, however. It’s the latest example of a continuing interest in female-directed and driven stories among Korean audiences. Seoul Pride film festival organiser and activist Dave Kim suggests that interest in women’s rights in South Korean society has risen dramatically in recent years, impacting not only real life but also what is popular at the cinema. “After #MeToo in 2018, there was a rising support for feminism in Korea. This has strongly affected the arthouse film market also. The main audience group is young women and they have become more willing to watch more films with a feminist idea or directed by a female director.”Seoul-based producer and film journalist Pierce Conran agrees. “A lot of the indie successes over the last year or two in Korea have been about marginalised women, films about young women or girls … and themes of identity,” he says. “Portrait of a Lady on Fire was able to latch on to that in a big way.”#MeToo has had a dramatic effect in South Korea. The country had always ranked low among OECD countries on women’s rights, particularly in terms of pay parity and the number of women in political roles. South Korea had its Harvey Weinstein equivalent in An hee-jung, a high-flying politician brought down by sexual assault allegations. As in the US and Europe, it prompted a similar wave of women sharing their experiences and support. But Tomboy’s success is also down to a uniquely astute form of marketing, particularly on social media. South Korea’s biggest cinema attendees are young people, particularly women aged between 20 and 35. Like a number of independent releases in South Korea, Tomboy’s distributor offered ingeniously designed special pins, decorative tape and photo cards that depict key scenes from the film, handed out at special screenings or awarded after seeing the film a certain number of times. One set of pins, for example, mirrors a scene in Tomboy with the young protagonist’s first kiss, with folds in the presenting card enabling the characters’ eyes to be covered. .“More and more people are collecting these items to remember and celebrate the movies,” says designer Oh Sebeom. “Audiences now want to see not only the beauty of the merchandise, but also how they capture the meaning and details of the movie.” According to Oh, the benefit isn’t purely to turn a profit: these items aren’t mass produced like collectible popcorn buckets but limited-edition pieces designed to sustain interest throughout a film’s theatrical run. Scroll Instagram and you’ll see countless posts of these sold-out items from fans. “The audience was able to naturally promote the movie on social media,” says Choi Yuri, chief executive of OURS, the marketing firm working on the film, predicting that the popularity of such promotional items “will grow even more”.But do gimmicks like this work? Just look at the box office figures. Though South Korea’s population of 51 million is dwarfed by those of Russia and China, the country is frequently at the top of global box office grosses, and increasing year on year. Latest reports from UniFrance and Statista found that South Koreans attended cinemas on average 4.3 times each in 2019, much more often than people in the UK (2.64 times), Australia (3.38 times), or the US (3.77 times). Even after the Covid-19 outbreak, while occupancy limits were imposed and major studio releases were postponed, South Korean cinemas never closed, giving increased opportunities for independent films such as Tomboy, which normally have to fight for screens.“That mindset is prominent – you see so many collectibles for different films,” says Hieu Chau, a film programmer and founder of the website Filmed in Ether. Chau points to other forms of entertainment – K-pop, for example – that are able to drive a fervent social media following through similar experiential elements, offering exclusive items and in-person opportunities that are primed for sharing, and a way of adding value to an otherwise intangible thing. “It’s a way for you to take a piece of the film with you, and physically show your support for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febf2b20a36d500142170d8b397f5c46d56af747/363_1141_5207_3124/master/5207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcb684402195ecaa15caf47063dbe599","title":"how to make hummus recipe felicity cloake","story":"How to make the nation’s favourite dip with just a few store-cupboard ingredientsRemember the great hummus crisis of 2017, when the country went into meltdown over a temporary shortage of chickpea puree? Ah, they were happy days … Anyway, now the problem is more likely to be that you can’t face going to the shops to buy hummus, but the solution is the same: if you’ve got the ingredients, make your own.Prep 10 min, plus soakingCook Zero to 2 hr+, depending on the chickpeasServes 4200g dried chickpeas, or 1 x 400g tin or jar (see step 1)1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)3 garlic cloves, or to taste6 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, or more to taste1 generous pinch ground cuminFine salt, to tasteExtra-virgin olive oil, to topIf you’re using dried chickpeas, which is my preference, because I think they have a better flavour, put them in a large bowl and cover with twice the volume of cold water.If you’re using a tin, skip straight to step four – the jarred Spanish kind are pricey, but their buttery texture makes it worth it if you can run to the expense.Stir in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda, if using, and leave to soak for 24 hours – this will help the chickpeas soften more quickly, and give the finished hummus a creamier consistency, but if you don’t have it available, or really don’t like the flavour even in small amounts, leave it out.Drain and rinse the chickpeas, put them in a large pan with the remaining bicarb and cover again with cold water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently until tender, adding more water if necessary – this will probably take a couple of hours, depending on the age of the chickpeas they should be easy to crush, but not falling apart.Leave the chickpeas to cool in the cooking liquid, then drain well, reserving the water. If using tinned or jarred chickpeas, drain them, and likewise keep their liquid. Set aside a spoonful of the chickpeas to use as a garnish. If you’d like a really silky end product, remove the papery skins (which should be falling off by this point anyway), by rubbing the chickpeas between your fingers it’s a fiddly job, true, but I think well worth it.Peel and crush the garlic (three cloves are my preference for this amount of chickpeas, but you may wish to add more, or less, depending on your tolerance for raw garlic), and put half of it in a small bowl.Stir in the tahini and half the lemon juice, to make a stiff paste, then gradually beat in just enough of the reserved chickpea water to loosen it to a pourable liquid consistency.Put this and the drained chickpeas in a food processor (or, if you’re using a stick blender, a sturdy bowl if you don’t have either, you can use a pestle and mortar to crush the chickpeas in batches, provided you have the time and patience – though you’ll need then to press it through a sieve to get the mix to the right texture.Blitz the chickpeas until really smooth, then add the cumin, a good pinch of salt and the rest of the garlic. With the motor still running, drizzle in enough of the reserved cooking water to get the desired consistency – the hummus should hold its shape, but not be heavy or claggy. Taste and add more salt, lemon or garlic, if you think it needs it.Spoon the hummus into a serving bowl and then pour a little olive oil around the side. Finish by scattering the reserved chickpeas in the centre you could also add a sprinkle of sesame seeds, za’atar, sumac or smoked paprika, if you fancy it, or indeed some fresh herbs such as finely chopped coriander or mint.Purists may be horrified, but hummus is a very versatile base. Add pureed cooked beetroot or other vegetables (roast red peppers or squash are particularly nice), or swap some of the chickpeas for other beans or pulses, if you prefer. Homemade (or, indeed, shop-bought) hummus is the perfect home for that almost empty jar of harissa or the last handful of frozen peas, so be creative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43efe530f69fe23cc53861347ed9829f4f3db00/0_232_6960_4176/master/6960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8a53062f39aac3f8f7e098713f6178c","title":"kim joys recipe for sushi shaped vegan mini cakes","story":"There’s no fish but lots of fun with this delicious combination of cake, fondant, buttercream and sugar syrup These tasty mini-cakes are shaped like sushi but are sweet vegan treats. They may look as if they require plenty of effort but are not as hard as you might imagine, plus you’ll have a lot of fun making them. You can make this recipe with any kind of white cake although I’ve chosen this one because it’s firm and will be easier to shape.

Then add in the cubes of vegan butter, and beat together until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.Add in the plant-based milk, vegan yoghurt and vanilla. Beat until combined. Then whisk using an electric whisk on high for another three minutes, until light in colour and fluffy. If whisking by hand, it’ll take longer.Pour into the prepared cake tin, and then bake for 30 to 40 minutes until the top springs back when pressed lightly, and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for five minutes, then run a knife around the edges and turn out on to a wire rack. Once the cake has cooled, wrap in clingfilm and then place in the freezer for two hours (this will make the cake easier to cut).To make the buttercream, whisk together the butter and icing sugar until soft and fluffy. Remove two teaspoons of buttercream into a separate bowl and dye this green – this will be the “wasabi”. Cover both bowls and set aside for now. Slice the piece of stem ginger into thin slivers. Add a tiny amount of pink food dye and rub into the ginger to make it look like the pickled variety.Spoon some green buttercream into a small dish, and place the ginger next to it. Make the sugar syrup “soy sauce” by mixing the boiling water with the muscovado sugar until dissolved (place in the microwave in short bursts if needed). Then pour into a small serving dish.When the cake is chilled, cut off the brown crusts and then use a small round cutter to stamp out pieces of cake. Use a sharp knife to cut out rectangular shapes, and carve the top edges so that they’re slightly curved. You are aiming for the general shape of the rice in nigiri sushi. Cut or stamp out as many shapes as possible. You will have leftover cake scraps – you can eat these as they are, or turn them into cake pops.To make the maki-shaped cake sushi, use a palette knife to completely cover the mini round cakes with white buttercream. Roll out the black fondant until thin, then cut into strips. Wrap the cakes in the black fondant so the sides are covered but not the top. Sprinkle the outer edge of the cake top with desiccated coconut, and then put small chopped pieces of gummy sweets, marzipan or apple in the centre.To make the nigiri-shaped cake sushi, use a palette knife to completely cover the rectangular cakes with white buttercream, then sprinkle over the desiccated coconut. Make the fish toppings by shaping the pink fondant into fish slices. Then paint using food dye mixed with a little water. Use a knife or toothpick to create texture. Place these on top of the coconut-covered cakes. Shape the marzipan into a rectangle to resemble tamago, which you can use as a topping. Wrap with another thin piece of black fondant.

For a while they looked set to blow Swansea apart but the Welsh side rallied in the final 15 minutes of the half and began pass the ball around confidently in the opposing half. Swansea, then, will be reasonably satisfied to be still very much in this tie. Both team look capable of scoring. This is far from over.42 min: A Swansea move breaks down ... and suddenly Brentford are bearing down on goal! Benrahma feeds Mbeumo, who runs into the right-hand side of the box ... Van der Hoorn closes in on him ... and the striker fails to get off a shot, instead confusing himself as he decides whether to square the ball or open fire. He ends up running the ball out of play. That was plod.39 min: Brewster and Ayew have looked bright for Swansea but not in the right areas: they’re both having to come deep to try to create something for themselves or each other they’re not getting enough help from teammates.37 min: After smart work by Watkins, Benrahma embarks on another teasing run. HE drives down the left and then veers in-field before unleashing a fierce shot. It dips, but not enough to hit the target.35 min: An encouraging spell from Swansea. Without really threatening, they played some dinky stuff in Brentford territory.33 min: Ayew dribbles past two players wide on the right, but Henry reuses to be the third. The left-back takes the ball and clears.32 min: Gallagher caught late by Jensen in midfield, giving Swansea a freekick and some respite.30 min: Brentford are playing some lovely stuff. Their moving in a whirl and passing slickly. They were on the brink of another breakthrough just now until the final ball ruined some wonderful buildup play.27 min: Watkins makes another clever run and is picked out by a long pass from deep. Watkins then pokes the ball on to Benrahma, coming on from the left. The forward’s shot is headed well wide until it ricochets off a defender into the arms of the keeper.Drinks break.  And it was hard earned. It’s been a rip-roaring first quarter.22 min: Ayew flips the ball wide to Dalsgaard and spins to run into the box in anticipation of a cross. Dalsgaard aims for Bidwell at the back post, but it doesn’t reach him. 19 min: Raya es low to his left to make an excellent one-handed save from Gallagher. Then Brentford race down the other end. Benrahma cuts in-field from the left and cracks a low right-footed shot ... off the post! A close shave at either end within a matter of 40 seconds!17 min: Grimes boots the ball downfield after a corner by Brentford momentarily sparks mayhem in the Swansea box. Brentford look minded to finish this tie in the first half.Brentford strike again! They’ve overturned the first leg deficit! Swansea are on the ropes. Marcondes darted into the box to get on the end of a well aimed cross from Benrahma and was left totally free to head into the net from 10 yards.15 min: Watkins’ goal has done Brentford a power of good. They’re pinging the ball around with extra pizzazz now. They smell blood.14 min: Jensen’s cross is blocked by Ayew’s arm. Freekick to Brentford in a useful crossing position on the left. Actually, Benrahma thinks a shot is on ... and he fizzes a curler several yards over the bar.What a counter-attack from the corner! Raya caught the corner and then threw the ball out quickly to Jensen, who spotted Watkins run and quickly played him in. The striker kept his cool as he raced towards the box and then placed a precise low shot past Mulder. It’s up for grabs now! 11 min: Swansea freekick near the right-hand corner flag. It’s curled towards the back post. Raya leaps to claim.10 min: Dalsgaard booked for thoughtless tackle from behind in opposing territory. He was never going to get the ball and deserves his yellow. 8 min: Three Brentford players position themselves around the keeper as they await Jensen’s corner. But Jansson blocks Bidwell to relieve the pressure on the visitors by giving them a freekick.7 min: After a ropey clearance by Mulder, Brentford have a throw-in near the corner flag. Dalsgaard chucks in a long one. It’s headed behind by Guehi for a corner.5 min: Excellent tackle by Van der Hoorn near mid-way to stop Benrahma in his tracks.4 min: Marcondes has a pop fro 30 yards. The ball swerves all over the place so Mulder decides to take no chances and punches it to safety.3 min: Norgaard tracks back to rob the ball off Brewster as he forward began to make his way to within shooting range.2 min: No sign of Swansea sitting on their lead. They’re started in enterprising fashion. The managers’ promises of an open game looks like it’s going to be fulfilled. 1 min: Swansea kick off. One of these teams are on their way to the playoff final! The teams enter the arena to a rousing welcome from the stadium announcer, who’s undeterred by the lack of spectators. The Bees are in their usual red and white stripes with black shorts. Swansea are also in stripes - black and turquoise - with turquoise shorts and socks. “I’ll be honest with you, I don’t know many of the names on the team sheets but I’m pretty sure all the players on both sides know what they’re doing,” reveals Simon McMahon with the sort of intricate analysis that could earn him a job at Griffin Park, once it’s demolished and turned into houses. “May the best team win. On closer inspection I did, however, notice that Swansea have a Brewster and a Van Der Hoorn in their starting XI. Now, as any Dundee United fan will tell you, Craig Brewster scored the winner when United won the Scottish Cup for the first time in their history in 1994, and Freddy Van der Hoorn was at the club then too, though didn’t play in the final. Any Swansea fans know if either of their current first team namesakes are related?” The Brewster in action today is 20-year-old Rhian Brewster, whom Liverpool fans will tell you is on loan from Anfield and a very promising attacking talent. I don’t think he’s related to Craig but am not sure. Mike van der Hoorn is a defender and I know even less about his family tree.“We need to win. Of course we will attack. We are playing against a very good side that gave us a very good game three days ago. I’m pretty sure Steve is coming to attack too. So we will see a very open match. If we can win it by two in normal time, then great. If not, we are prepared to go to extra-time and penalties if needed.” He concludes with a prophesy: “I’m pretty sure that one of the BMW is going to score tonight.”“We’re going to set up normally. It’s difficult to play for a draw. We have a vision for how we want the game to go: we want to score goals and we want to keep a clean sheet. I really believe in the players I think we can win every game we play ... I thought the first leg was a very good game with both teams playing attacking football with good tactical ideas. I think this will be the same. The game is in the balance. We have an advantage from the first game but its only an advantage if we use it well.”Hello. One hundred and sixteen years ago Griffin Park staged its first competitive match, a 1-1 draw between Brentford and Plymouth Argyle in the Western League. Today the dear old ground hosts its last game and if things go as the home side hope, then Brentford will be a step closer to the Premier League. So today is about a farewell and a potential happy return for a club who have been estranged from the top-flight since 1947. But Swansea want to get back there, too, and they have the advantage of a 1-0 lead from the first leg thanks to André Ayew’s goal and Rico Henry’s sending off. The red card has been rescinded but it’s up to Brentford to overturn the score.Brentford certainly have the firepower to do it. They were the highest scorers in the Championship thanks mainly to their celebrated “BMW” strikeforce (Said Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins). But no member of that trio has scored in their last three matches, all of which Brentford lost, just as promotion seemed theirs for the taking. And if you want to talk about form, let’s also mention Brentford’s ominous playoff record: they’ve been in playoffs eight times in various isions and never emerged with promotion.Swansea, meanwhile, took this route to the Premier League as recently as 2011 and, to get back to more relevant times, have hit form at just the right time, sneaking into the playoff places thanks to a 4-1 away victory on the final day of the regular season (and a Nottingham Forest collapse), which they followed up with that 1-0 first-leg win. We have ourselves a proper showdown, folks. Let’s be having you!

Because peaches don’t keep terribly well, that stretch will be filled by different varieties that mature at staggered times. If you find one you like, it will be gone soon enough, but if you stock up you are going to need some innovative ways to make use of them.Reading up on peach recipes, I fully expected that most, if not all of them, would include a line mentioning that nectarines could be substituted, since a nectarine is a sort of smooth-skinned peach. But almost none of them did.So, I guess it falls to me to offer this obvious advice: you can use nectarines in recipes that specify peaches, and vice versa. If you want to make nectarine melba, be my guest. If you want to use peaches in Dan Lepard’s nectarine strudel, I will not stop you (and neither, I suspect, will he).Should you need to remove the fuzzy skin of your peaches for a recipe (often it is not necessary, but the skin can sometimes become tough with cooking), you can deploy the same method recommended for tomatoes: blanch them in just-boiled water for about a minute. When they are cool enough to handle, the skins should slip off.Peaches reach their peak just as the summer heat makes cooking feel like a pointless drag. It is perhaps because of this that they feature in a lot of American desserts that seem to make a virtue of slapdashery and unfussiness, with names to match: slump, grunt, buckle. These days, the term “deconstructed” is preferred when you want to reassure people that the dish looks like that on purpose.A peach slump is the kind of pie you throw together – lumpy biscuit dough spooned over sweetened, sliced peaches and then baked – but it is just as delicious as more presentable desserts. When the slump comes out of the oven, you invert it on to a serving dish so that the crust ends up on the bottom. This recipe uses American cups, but don’t let that get you down – pick an average-sized mug from the cupboard and eyeball the fractions. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall does an anglicised version, but he doesn’t flip it over at the end, which technically makes it a peach grunt.Peach buckle is a type of rough-and-ready cake, traditionally cooked in and served from an iron skillet. Martha Stewart’s has a crunchy almond and cinnamon top. Again, she uses US measurements, but the relevant conversions are: 680g peaches 113g butter 150g sugar and 150g flour. Maths aside, the rest is easy: batter and peaches are folded together, sprinkled with the almond mixture and baked. For variety, you can replace some of the peaches with a seasonal berry of your choice.Peach cobbler is very much in the same vein. Ruby Tandoh teams peaches with raspberries for her cornmeal cobbler, while Clare Ptak combines nectarines and cherries.Yotam Ottolenghi’s peach, rosemary and lime galette has a more sophisticated ring to it, but that doesn’t mean it is any more difficult to produce. Shop-bought puff pastry keeps the effort to a minimum. This galette is a particularly good way to employ the hard, underripe peaches that are often all you can find, as is Nigel Slater’s peach and honey cake with pine nuts.Truly the simplest treatment you can give a peach is a good roasting – a few minutes under a hot grill to concentrate the flavour. Clare Ptak roasts peaches halved with vanilla, raspberries and sweet white wine, which you could probably manage on a barbecue of a summer night, when everything else is cooked and the coals are still hot.For a dessert with no heat in it, try a peach-based trifle. Thomasina Miers’s version (again pairing peaches with raspberries) includes a peach compote that comes together in about 10 minutes if you make extra, you can have it for breakfast all week. There is a custard to make as well, but after that it is a mere matter of assembly. Then you and the trifle get to chill for a few hours.Colder still is Liam Charles’s peach melba freeze-cake: a biscuit base topped with a filling of peaches, cream, cream cheese and ice-cream, swirled with a raspberry drizzle and frozen hard. This is, of course, a spin-off of peach melba, the classic (and deeply unfashionable) pudding created in honour of Nellie Melba by the French chef Auguste Escoffier more than a century ago. There is a lot of debate about the poaching – or not – of the peaches, but Felicity Cloake’s authoritative version strives to capture its original simplicity, which fortunately means it is also pretty easy.Peaches are not just for pudding. They can feature in salads alongside savoury and especially salty ingredients, where you might otherwise deploy some kind of melon. Ottolenghi’s peach, raspberry and watercress salad is a great, if counterintuitive, accompaniment to pork belly.Miers’s freekeh, nectarine and halloumi salad offers a comprehensive range of flavours – sweet, sour, salt – and textures in a simple summer lunch. Fearnley-Whittingstall’s peach, prosciutto, ricotta and rocket salad is in the same ballpark, while this peach panzanella, with brioche croutons, lettuce and mozzarella, is just the right side of weird.Finally, there is peach shrub. This is not a plant, but a sweet-and-sour syrup used in all manner of alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails. It is a combination of macerated, sieved peaches, cider vinegar and, in this case, ginger. The proportions are straightforward, the preparation basic and the result will keep in the fridge for months, although you might fancy a little right now. And, by all means, try it with nectarines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9985d1acbfed6489f0f455505d9db08bfd6bb27b/0_131_3837_2302/master/3837.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c5d22f09a3e154a68866c739eb2bd7a1","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

From a petal-filled bath, she said: “What’s terrible about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways, and what’s wonderful about is, is that it’s made us all equal in many ways.”In May, she said she had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, and assumed that she and her team had been ill with the virus at the end of her winter tour. “At the time we all thought we had a bad flu,” she said.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that Madonna had made a €1m donation to a fund organised by the EU to find a vaccine for Covid-19.• This article was amended on 29 July 2020 because it was Instagram, not Madonna as an earlier version said, that deleted the video from Madonna’s profile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e1fbc8fbf071e6deb7f94282930fb4a59bbf693/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=86349166c10dbecfc619aaf007d9ba09 1440w","title":"virgin galactic offers peek inside new space plane for tourists","story":"Inside of VSS Unity unveiled, showing the cabin in which six passengers will be able to float in zero gravity on the edge of spaceVirgin Galactic has revealed the interior of its centrepiece space plane, showing off a cabin with new custom seats and a “space mirror” in a virtual tour of what its passengers can expect to experience on flights to the edge of space.For $250,000 a ticket, passengers who have signed up for the suborbital flight aboard the air-launched plane VSS Unity will strap into six tailored seats and be able to peer out of the cabin’s 12 circular windows as they ascend 97km (60 miles) above Earth. The plane has five other windows.Virgin Galactic chief space officer George Whitesides said passengers could unbuckle themselves at peak altitude to float around the cabin in zero-gravity conditions.The company has 600 customers signed up to fly and at least 400 more who have expressed interest, Whitesides said. No date has been set for its first commercial space flight. British founder Sir Richard Branson is expected to be aboard.Virgin Galactic has never made a profit and has been plagued by successive delays. Branson said last year he hoped to make the first trip “in months, not years” after securing £60m of deposits.The cabin also features a large, circular mirror in the back “to allow our customers to see themselves in space in a way that has really never been done before,” Whitesides said.The plane, attached to a bigger carrier plane, is intended to take off from the company’s New Mexico spaceport and detach mid-air to launch further toward the edge of space in a trip lasting 90 minutes.Virgin Galactic is vying for space tourism supremacy with the SpaceX project launched by the Tesla founder, Elon Musk, and the Blue Origin venture headed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person.Branson floated the business on the stock market in October, securing $450m of funding through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, an investment vehicle run by the former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253c03e731041d7019d453b1c9e388170030da97/185_175_3515_2108/master/3515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f23fb26a97548209d3695ddccd2492","title":"uk food tsar obesity drive percy pigs henry dimbleby co founder of leon","story":"Co-founder of Leon thinks so-called ‘natural’ sweets are misleading over sugar contentHenry Dimbleby, a co-founder of the restaurant chain Leon, was appointed by the government to lead a landmark review of Britain’s food system to determine a national strategy. Here are some highlights of a Q\u0026ampA with Dimbleby ahead of the publication of the first part of that report.Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s Percy PigsI have had a bugbear about Percy Pigs for a while. Percy Pigs are a sweet that is marketed on the front with all-natural fruit juice and it’s right by your kids’ little fingers. And on the back, if you understand calorie labelling, the first four ingredients are forms of sugar. I just think that is not right. I think that is genuinely misleading. The reason I pick M\u0026ampS is because they have integrity as one of their values, but it is rampant in the food world: Low-fat which is actually high in sugar. “Free from” this, that and the other.Yes CEOs have to respond to commercial pressures, but they are not unable to take any value-based decisions.Should sweets have plain packaging?No. I think we would get a massive backlash. I went to a party the other day where all of the children were just given carrot batons. There wasn’t any cake or any sweets, and in those little children’s eyes I saw a joyless future. There’s something about plain packaging on sweets that for me would feel like too much government intervention.On ‘healthy’ fruit snacksSome of those - not all of those - are the kind of thing that are being clothed in a veneer of goodness and actually may be no better for you than a Mars bar. Not all of them. It depends what the level of fibre is and the level of sugar.On his weightI wouldn’t recommend any diets that I have used. My weight oscillates between the high end of healthy weight and the low end of obese, and it is a conscious struggle. Basically, we have been putting on weight since the 50s so our will power hasn’t had a sudden collapse, we’ve just gradually put on weight consistently since the 50s, and I think it’s for us to lose weight but the government can make it much easier. We have a tendency to want to eat foods that are high in fat and sugar and those foods are everywhere and marketed at us.What has Covid-19 taught us about the food supply chain?The biggest weakness it has exposed is the wake-up call on health. 1.6m years of life are lost every year to ill health and death from diet-related diseases. It is just bleak that this form of life-giving sustenance is now killing us.Should The Great British Bake Off be banned?No. I love baking and I love Bake Off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7abeec277e41c01c15e06ca317d756b2a14fdcd5/0_0_4029_2418/master/4029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b944e83437e47d64a50336f74bca620","title":"andy murray covid lockdown tennis world tour returns","story":"As professional tennis gears up for its return next week at the Palermo Ladies Open, Andy Murray believes that after nearly five months of inaction, players should prepare for a considerably different tour with ample upsets and opportunities for anyone bold enough to take them.“You just can’t replicate matches in practice, it just isn’t the same,” said Murray. “It is different on the body, on the mind. The pressure is just different and no matter how hard you try to make your practices as challenging and difficult as matches, they just aren’t.“Some players who have had injury lay-offs will probably be a little bit more experienced in terms of coming back after a long period, but it’s an opportunity for players. There will be upsets for sure. Going into the US Open with potentially only one or two matches in the Cincinnati event in New York, it will make for some interesting results.”Murray was defeated on Tuesday evening in the Battle of the Brits alongside his mixed doubles partner, Jodie Burrage. Despite the fact male and female players compete in the same venues around the world, it is rare to see all British players under the same roof. For Murray, tennis continues to squander a big opportunity by failing to bring men and women closer together.“I think sports miss a bit of a trick with this stuff. The Hopman Cup, for example, was a brilliant event in my opinion … Putting match-ups in tennis like Serena Williams and Roger Federer on the same court, it is so brilliant for our sport. We are able to do that in tennis and I think we should embrace it a little bit more, not necessarily every single week, but at times it would be great. I would like to see Rafa on the court with some of the top female players.”Williams is among the entries for the Western \u0026amp Southern Open starting on 20 August, while the men’s draw will feature Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. The tournament is usually held in Cincinnati, but because of the coronavirus pandemic will now be played in New York at the site of the US Open, which begins three days after the finals. Both players had previously expressed doubt about travelling to the United States, so their entry is something of a surprise.In Wednesday’s Battle of the Brits action, Heather Watson continued to work off her rust with a 3-6, 6-1, 10-6 win over Eden Silva while Cameron Norrie ousted the British No 1, Dan Evans, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6), his second win over Evans this week.Meanwhile the LTA has appointed Michael Bourne, the acting director of performance at UK Sport, as its new performance director.

Each time the former kickboxing dynamo wipes away her tears, laughs a little while saying sorry, and continues. “Those moments have led me to this moment,” she says after one poignant pause, “where I now manage to not look for approval from outside. Rather, I go inwards and find strength from within.”Begum reiterates her passion for fighting and her certainty that she can still become a success in her new sport of boxing despite the odds stacked against her. “I do love it. Stepping into the ring allows you to grow because you’re putting yourself in such depths of fear. And when you overcome that there’s such a sense of accomplishment. I love that and the fact I’m constantly working towards my goal, and progressing, even if I sometimes lose.”She is a petite 36-year-old, a warm and reflective woman who also has a degree in architecture. At 5ft 3in, she does not look like a fighter. And so it’s strange, at first, to reconcile the fact that the violent backdrop of Muay Thai and boxing have brought serenity into Begum’s often turbulent world.“I think any creative art form, whether music or dance, Muay Thai or boxing, allows you to channel emotion and express yourself,” she says. “I was fortunate to have discovered Thai boxing when I had few other opportunities to express myself. I found my passion in life and realised I was good at it. But it’s like anything in life – talent is nothing without sacrifice. There needs to be hard work. There needs to be discipline and focus.“So when I had all those problems I didn’t blame others. I took responsibility and said: ‘OK, this is where I am. How do I move forward?’ I found the best way to heal myself is through sport. So I’m really grateful for having Muay Thai and now boxing in my life.”Begum’s new book, Born Fighter, provides an absorbing insight into the obstacles she faced. It is written with Sarah Shephard and the two women, from Muslim and Jewish backgrounds, complement each other as we learn how Begum hid her passion for Thai boxing from her family for many years. She was torn between her desire to be a dutiful Muslim daughter and a darker yearning to discover her real self in the ring.The KO Combat Academy, where much of the book is set, is located under an arch in a backstreet of Bethnal Green. Trains clatter overhead and it makes me think how intimidating it must have been for a teenage Bangladeshi girl to approach a gym. “The original gym was across the road,” Begum explains, “and I can’t believe I had the courage to walk in. This is now more a commercial gym whereas back then it was hardcore. It was just fighters.”Bill Judd, who trained Begum to her world championship, welcomes us today. He was just as accepting, if initially surprised, when the 18-year-old Begum told him she wanted to be a fighter. She could cover the bruises on her arms and legs, which she took from kicks, but she became adept at avoiding blows to her face. And when she was marked up her sister helped her hide the damage or she pulled her hijab more closely around her face.Five years later Begum was forced to abandon Muay Thai. She was coerced into an arranged marriage by her family – who meant well in adhering to the traditions of their culture. “I was 23 and it was overwhelming,” Begum recalls. “I thought: ‘Whoa, I need to take a breath because I don’t even know him.’ I felt so much pressure to go along with it so I tried to speak to my mum. She waved me away and was very dismissive. They made it clear this was going to happen.”Begum stresses that her husband, a banker from east London, was not a monster. Her book’s most harrowing pages detail how she felt trapped and suffocated living with her husband’s family who expected her to do so many chores on their behalf. “I was oppressed,” she says. “I didn’t have that freedom to say: ‘I’m feeling a bit tired so I’ll do the washing in an hour.’ I was constantly trying to please them but whatever I did wasn’t enough. At the same time I’d started a high-pressure job as a trainee architect. Eventually it took a toll on me.”Begum details the severe panic attacks which engulfed her after nine months. Her doctor advised her to move back to her parents. She was in a terrible state and only the eventual understanding of her parents stabilised her. What would have happened if they had insisted she return to her marriage? “I would have stood my ground and said no. But it would have been a battle to find the courage and strength – especially when I was very vulnerable. My father was in two minds. But my mum and older brother were like: ‘No, she has to go back. This is the tradition.’ I tried to explain it to my father after one of my therapy sessions. And his reaction wasn’t good. But at that point my ex-husband filed for orce and I was thinking: ‘God, it’s the biggest relief.’ My parents understood then what I had been through.“I was on antidepressants for four months and completely bedridden. But I didn’t want to be on antidepressants because they numb you. The only thing I remembered enjoying was Muay Thai and so I told myself: ‘Get back to the gym.’ One day I asked my parents to drop me off when they were coming to Whitechapel to shop. I then said: ‘Actually, can you come in with me?’ I introduced them to Bill.”The trainer outlined the discipline of the sport and stressed how Begum was so respectful, and respectable, in the gym. Her parents agreed she could return. But new problems soon emerged. Begum cries when she tells me how she was bullied by other female fighters at the gym.“It went on for five years and Bill kept saying to me: ‘Why don’t you just leave and go to another gym?’ I thought: ‘No. I don’t want to be pushed out.’ Bill hated it but his focus was on that group of girls. I wish he supported me more because I just wanted equal treatment. So it really broke my heart and that’s why I’m torn about this place. I’ve had some amazing moments here but also a lot of pain.”Begum shocked everyone in 2011 by becoming a European champion in Latvia without having anyone in her corner. A Danish trainer in the crowd ran to help her when he saw Begum was on her own between rounds.Over the next few years Judd worked more closely with Begum and helped her become a world champion kickboxer in 2016. In the week of her defining fight against Susanna Salmijärvi, her ME was so debilitating that Begum was stunned when she passed a medical to fight. “I was bed-bound the whole week so I said to Bill: ‘I’m too weak to even do a warm-up. Just put me in the ring. If anything happens, throw in the towel. But give me the first round so I have those two minutes to try and knock her out. This is an opportunity I’ll never get again.’ I had enough energy for two minutes which could define the rest of my life.”She came close to an early knockout but her opponent got up and, at the end of a brutal fight, Begum absorbed sustained punishment. She had done just enough to become world champion and, as she says now, “It was a 10-year journey and my first thought was: ‘Thank you, God.’”When she got home that night, battered but carrying her world championship belt, she woke her parents. “My dad jumped out of bed and started calling his friends,” she laughs. “That morning I’d been unwell and he didn’t speak to me. I wanted his blessing but he tried to pretend he didn’t know about the fight. I asked my mum for her blessing. She prayed and gave me a big hug. But when I got home around midnight my dad was so happy and proud.”Her parents surprised her when they did not resist her decision to accept an offer from David Haye to switch to professional boxing in 2018. It has been difficult for Begum and she has only had two bouts as a pro boxer – both against Ivanka Ivanova. The first fight was a draw and then, in June 2019, she was hurt badly and lost a decision to her Bulgarian opponent.“She didn’t hurt me in the first fight and so I was shocked the second time. There was just something unusual about her that night. When I hit her there was no reaction. That freaks me out because I’ve sparred with some boys, and good pros, in Vegas. I’ve made their noses bleed and if I hit someone there’s always some reaction. But there was nothing like that in our second fight. She was like a zombie.“It didn’t help that she elbowed me in the first 30 seconds and my eye completely closed. I was fighting with just one eye and it was very hard to measure distance. Everyone wanted me to give up afterwards but I’ve followed my gut. It’s a learning curve and the only problem with boxing is that once you lose your unbeaten record it’s meant to be over. And it’s far harder being a female boxer because there are no journeywomen. Any woman that goes into boxing is a serious fighter because they wouldn’t get signed otherwise.”The Covid crisis has made it even more difficult but Begum is convinced she will become a world champion boxer. She is in talks with promoters in the US and says: “I’m hopeful. I feel like my story is bigger than boxing and these challenges will make me a better fighter and a better person.

The world outside is reeling and we have our masks at the ready before we leave the gym.

In a strange exchange, yet another congress member has targeted the tech executives over supposed anti-conservative bias. Representative Greg Steube asked Sundar Pichai why his campaign emails are being sorted into the Spam inbox on his parents’ Gmail accounts. He claimed it was an anti-conservative conspiracy. “This is appears to only be happening to conservative Republicans,” he said. “I don’t see anything in the news or anything in the press or members on the other side of the aisle talking about their campaign emails getting thrown in junk folders in Gmail - so my question is is why is this only happening to Republicans?” he asked.Pichai said “there is nothing in the algorithm that has to do with political ideology”.A report from the Markup published in February found many political candidates - both conservative and progressive - find that Google’s algorithm sends their emails to Spam or to other inboxes. Upon return from the recess, finally a question for Bezos. Rep. Pramila Jayapal asks if Amazon accesses data from third parties to sell its own brands, asking Bezos for “a yes or no” answer. Bezos gives a rambling response, declining to deny or confirm the allegation. Jayapal notes that an April 2020 investigation from the Wall Street Journal found evidence that Amazon does engage in such anticompetitive practices. Amazon has access to data that “far exceeds” the sellers on the platform with whom it competes, the report found. “So you can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,” she said. “Do you think that’s fair to the mom and pop third party businesses who are trying to sell on your platform?”Another flashpoint in the first hours of the hearing - and one that arguably does not have to do with antitrust - was questions from Matt Gaetz of Florida regarding whether Google will continue to work with police despite backlash. Pichai said Google has no plans to end police contracts. “Congressman, we are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement,” he said.The hearing calls a ten minute recess to address technical issues - apparently related to Amazon’s feed. Maybe that’s why Bezos hasn’t been asked much yet. Now Zuckerberg is being asked about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and hate speech on the platform. He is asked about the recent boycott of Facebook by advertisers over hate speech. “We’re very focused on fighting against hate speech and our commitments to those issues and fighting them go back years before this recent movement,” he said. “Since 2016, the defenses that the company is built out to help secure elections in the US and around the world.”Apple CEO Tim Cook is addressed by Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia, who asks how Apple can so closely control its App Store without participating in anti-competitive behavior.He said during the antitrust investigation Congress members heard concerns that rules governing the App Store review process are not available to the app developers. “The rules are made up as you go and subject to change - and Apple expects developers to go along with the changes or leave the app store,” Johnson said. “That’s an enormous amount of power.”In the first few hours of testimony, Jeff Bezos has not yet been asked a single question. Poor Jeff!Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado opens his questioning with a grand statement: “Capitalism is the greatest tool for freedom the world has ever seen,” he says, apropos of nothing. He then criticizes Google for withdrawing from a $10bn Pentagon contract because it “does not align” with Google’s values while working on government projects in China, like the controversial project Dragonfly- a search engine that would work with the Chinese government. “What values do Google and communist China have in common?” he asked executive Sundar Pichai.Representative Jerry Nadler of New York is next in line to question the executives. He zeros in on Facebook’s history of acquiring competitors or stealing their ideas, referencing internal documents that revealed Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize it as a competitive threat.If so, the deal was illegal under antitrust laws and should be unwoven, legislators have argued. “If this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction, why shouldn’t Instagram now be broken off into a separate company?” Nadler asked. Zuckerberg said the acquisition was made in part to help Instagram build up its infrastructure and security as it experienced rapid growth. Nadler was not impressed with the answer. “This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent, and this should never have happened in the first place, it should never have been permitted to happen, it cannot happen again.”Representative Sensenbrenner launches again into his concerns about anti-conservative bias on social platforms, asking Zuckerberg why conservatives are “censored” on Facebook.“Conservatives are consumers too,” he said. He specifically asked Zuckerberg why Donald Trump Jr. was removed from the platform for sharing a video containing false information this week. Zuckerberg politely explained to the representative that it was Twitter that limited Trump’s account for posting the video. The video in question was, however, removed from Facebook though no accounts sharing it were censored. Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg why the video, which made baseless claims about coronavirus, was removed. He said people should be allowed to share posts that hail hydroxychloroquine as a “cure” for coronavirus even though the drug has not been found to be an effective treatment.Zuckerberg said the video violates Facebook’s safety policies, which “prohibit content that will lead to imminent risk of harm”.“Stating that there is a proven cure for Covid when there is in fact not might encourage someone to go take something that could have some adverse effect, so we do take that down,” he said.Zuckerberg, as he often does in Congressional hearings or when faced with criticism about accuracy on Facebook repeated his go-to line: “We do not want to be the arbiters of truth,” he said. Cicilline starts by assailing Alphabet chief executive officer Sundar Pichai with accusations of anticompetitive behavior from Google.“So my first question, Mr. Pichai, is why does Google steal content from honest businesses?” Ciccilline said.He said small businesses have accused Google of taking their content and listing on its own pages. One example cited was Google in 2010 taking reviews from Yelp and cross-posting them to its own pages. When Yelp asked Google to stop, Google reportedly threatened to remove Yelp from its search listings entirely. Cicilline said this behavior is “economically catastrophic” for other companies online.“The evidence seems very clear to me that as Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power,” he said. “It used its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats and crushed them. It has dampened innovation and new business growth.”Finally Mark Zuckerberg provides his opening statement, attempting to set Facebook apart from the other companies on the stand today.He said acquiring other companies like Instagram is not monopoly behavior. “Facebook stands for set of basic principles, giving people voice and economic opportunity, keeping people safe upholding democratic traditions like freedom of expression and voting and enabling an open and competitive marketplace,” he said. Tim Cook up next, arguing Apple does “not have a dominant market share” in any market where it does business. He addresses recent criticism that the rules surrounding Apple’s App Store unfairly charges companies to list apps.“After beginning with 500 apps, today the App Store hosts more than 1.7 million – only 60 of which are Apple software,” Cook’s he said. “Clearly, if Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store, not keep them off.”Read his full testimony here."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Reporters and fans such as Diet Prada, a pop culture critic on Instagram, say that despite the fact Spears is capable of maintaining a singing career that earns millions of dollars a year, she still needs permission to drive a car, leave her home, hire her own lawyer, and possibly even vote.Since 2008, Spears has been under a conservatorship, designed for people who cannot take care of themselves, where a court-approved  takes control of the conservatee’s finances and healthcare decisions.. The details of Spears’ conservatorship are confidential (calls and messages to her manager, talent agency, court-appointed lawyer and attorney all went unreturned), but it’s possible she has joined the thousands of Americans who are disenfranchised each year due to “incompetence” laws.Though the 38-year-old is rarely overtly political, in late March, she posted an Instagram message that said, “We will feed each other, re-distribute wealth, strike” – further captioned with the red rose emojis favored by the Democratic Socialists of America. “Comrade Britney knows: together we can build a better world,” the DSA tweeted in response, “because capitalism is Toxic”.When Spears was placed under a conservatorship, she would’ve been presumed to be ineligible to vote, but in 2016, California law changed. Now, the conservatee is assumed to be competent unless it’s proved to a court that she cannot communicate her desire to vote, which is the only standard she must meet.However, in other jurisdictions, the conservatee must understand the “nature and effect” of voting. According to Paul S Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University who helped develop that standard, that diagnosis boils down to three questions: what’s the purpose of an election? What’s the purpose of voting? And what’s the effect of voting?“This is a very simple screen,” says Appelbaum. “So you have to be quite impaired, and only a very small proportion of people will fail something like this.” However, the numbers may not be so insignificant, says Michelle Bishop, the voter access and engagement manager for the National Disability Rights Network, a non-profit that aims to improve the lives of people with disabilities.“It can be hard to track, which really scares me,” she says. According to one source, the latest Election Administration and Voting Survey, 9,569 people were removed from the voting rolls for mental incompetence in 2018. However, Bishop points out that election administrations would likely have access to that information only if they requested it from the judicial system. “We’re concerned that those numbers may not really be accurate,” she says.More fundamentally, though, Bishop argues that people with disabilities should be held to the same standards as everyone else. “All you have to be able to do is demonstrate your desire to vote,” she says. “You don’t have to prove you understand how our government works. You don’t have to say who you want to vote for and provide really good reasons for why you made that decision.” She laughs. “Quite frankly, we don’t all have good reasons.”Under California law, Britney Spears’s conservatorship is reviewed yearly or every two years, though she could petition the court at any time to restore her voting rights. It may just be a pop music trope, but Diet Prada points out that pushing against a controlling force is a theme through many of Britney’s hits. “I don’t need permission, make my own decisions,” she sings in one from 2004. “That’s my prerogative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f3f8b14c4f937d7ffe04ad25bb7f43529287dd6/0_179_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d487ceb4eafd5dab331562f361edb96","title":"it meant everything scenes from a remarkable graduation day","story":"The socially distanced ceremony was an unprecedented event for the Mississippi high school graduates – and a moving celebration of their hard-earned achievementsby  Oliver Laughland in Lexington photographs by Annie FlanaganAs an early summer sun beat down over a brick school building, red sequins on an outdoor stage rippled in the gentle breeze and Dr James Henderson took a minute to adjust his robe and face mask in the reflection of a car mirror.Henderson, superintendent of Holmes County Consolidated school district in the Mississippi delta, approached the lectern in front of a line of cars covered in balloons and handwritten messages of support.He cleared his breath. Lowered his mask. And boomed into a microphone over the hum of car engines. “I now confirm that you, the 2020 Holmes County Central high school class, are completers of high school in the great state of Mississippi. Congratulations to my graduates,” he said.A muted round of applause seemed to evaporate into the open air, before Pomp and Circumstance blasted over the loudspeakers to a near-empty parking lot.“We had to give them something, because they have lost so much,” Henderson said. “Giving them the opportunity to walk across that stage. For their parents to see them walk, it’s just the ultimate, right?”Among Holmes county’s class of 2020 were aspiring business people, doctors and surgeons, accountants, sports therapists, scientists and writers. Each was graduating into a time of economic and political uncertainty, just days before the country erupted into mass protest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Although personal tragedy had marked some of their childhoods, every student spoke with clarity about their vision of the future.“Today is different from how I imagined it because not all my family can come to support me. I have my mom, my two sisters and my girlfriend. My dad called me last night to tell me how proud he was, because he wasn’t in my life like he should have been. My grandaddy just recovered from Covid so he’s watching online. My best memory of high school is catching an interception during a football game against Cleveland Central this year. I worked so hard for that moment. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety, but I push myself so hard to make everyone proud. I’m going to Northeast Community college, and my dream is to play football professionally. But if my dream is not what God has planned, I want to be a physical therapist.”“Finishing school during the pandemic was hard, because where I live we really don’t have internet service. I had to sit by a window and try to get signal, to get all my work together and have a chance to graduate.They cancelled prom because of the pandemic, and I was just really sad because I never got to experience it and pick out a dress.I want to show my mom that the daughter she raised, the person I became, made all her work worth it. She did it for a reason. I’m planning on joining the army reserves, I want to branch out and see the world.”“I consider the class of 2020 to be possibly the strongest class in history. It’s been so different for us to go through all of this and still be successful.I spent two days writing my salutatorian speech to make sure it came from my heart. I told my class to stay focused, keep a tunnel vision on your dreams and let there be no limitations on you.This year’s valedictorian, Issac Randle Jr, delivered a speech urging his class to “live life and not let life live you”. His parents watched on from a parked red pickup truck, decorated with the words: “Quarantine couldn’t hold me I’m free at last.”They cheered as Randle was the first to pick up his diploma, a broad smile across his face. He will attend the University of Mississippi to study accounting under a grant and a scholarship.“He stayed the course,” said his mother Matilda. “And knowing that his hard work paid off. It just feels incredible.” The Randles planned to celebrate at home with a large family meal.Matilda Randle was far from the only proud parent that morning sitting quarantined inside their vehicle. Christine Baker, who had recently been furloughed from her job at a local car factory due to the pandemic, wore a T-shirt with her daughter Ma’Kiyah’s picture printed on it. She had raised her as a single parent.“I thanked God for allowing me to watch her walk that stage,” Baker said, tears in her eyes. “It meant everything to me. I went beyond and beneath, and put my life on the back burner to raise her.”The school district is preparing for a return to lessons next month. But as Covid-19 cases in the county surged over the summer and parents voiced their reluctance to send children back in person, there will be only online classes for high school students this term.Henderson watched in horror from Holmes county as Donald Trump thrust the issue of school return into the ongoing culture wars during the pandemic.“It seems like the federal government only cares about themselves and no one else. That the economy is more important to him than human beings,” he said. “But we here are taking care of ourselves.”Amber: “I’m going to Coahoma Community college this fall to study criminal justice. I want to be a lawyer. I see what’s going on in my community and there’s a lot of people getting charged unfairly. I want to be able to help those people.”“My fondest memory of high school will always be going with my classmates on field trips to experience different things out there in the world.I’m planning to go to college and study cosmetology. I want to open my own hair and nail salon, but I want to do it outside of Mississippi. I want to see something other than this state.”“There’s a lot of people dying and suffering right now, and I would love to be a part of the help. I’m going to Texas Southern University to study biology and then I want to train to become an anesthesiologist.It’s a dream I’ve had since middle school, watching Grey’s Anatomy and being interested in the simple jobs, besides the doctors and nurses, that people don’t really recognize.But tonight I’m just going to celebrate with family and have a cookout.”A number of Holmes County Central students were grappling with the loss of close family in recent years. The county has the 11th-lowest average life expectancy in the United States, at 71 years, which is seven and a half years below the national average.Tony Christopher Jr’s father passed away in February 2017 after a brief hospitalization. “They didn’t tell us too much about it, I just woke up one day and they told us he was in the hospital,” Christopher said, an image of his father printed on his graduation stole. “I just know he’d be very proud of me graduating because it’s something he didn’t do.”Mercedes Black lost her aunt to illness in April 2019. “If it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t have made it this far,” Black said, an image of her aunt adorning her graduation cap that was decorated in flowers. “When I was struggling in school she would help, she always told me to never give up. All she told me was that she wanted to see me graduate and walk that stage, and I just hate that she couldn’t be here to see us. She was like my second mom.”For a moment the ceremony dispensed with social distancing as Tamia Anderson took to the stage. As she collected her diploma, Henderson offered her a split-second hug as her great grandmother Roosevelt Anderson and grandmother Janice Harper screamed with joy from their car: “That’s my baby! You go girl!”In June 2018 Tamia’s mother took her own life. The aftermath was laced with trauma.“I didn’t really deal with it how I should have,” Anderson said. “I bottled up my emotions and it ended up turning into anger.”She was almost moved to an alternative school, but took time out for counseling and was allowed to return after a hearing. Tamia graduated almost at the top of her class.The Anderson family moved to Mississippi from Chicago 20 years ago after all three of Roosevelt’s sons were killed in the city, leaving Janice the only child still alive.“I moved here to get away from Chicago,” Roosevelt said. “I wanted to find a place where the family could always come for peace and rest.”The tragedy of the suicide compounded generations of grief. Tamia thought of her mother as she collected her diploma.“She’s smiling so hard right now, I can feel it all over me,” she said as she exited the stage. The family returned home straight after, to a residence in the hills outside Lexington with manicured lawns, blooming flowers and a horse grazing in a small field.Tamia walked to her mother’s grave in a plot by the house, and reflected on the completion of her high school education.“It means so much to me,” she said of the ability to graduate in person. “You have no idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36736f1636410a00bafd6b1679f8dacc3b96ec9/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dc5f72bbdbadc855741a7128f937e01","title":"texas hidalgo county border mexico coronavirus","story":"Hundreds have died in Hidalgo county, on the Mexican border – but the governor has thwarted efforts to go back into lockdownSeventy-two death notices sprawled across an entire page of the Monitor newspaper in Hidalgo county recently.The small-print entries, stacked in five tidy columns, didn’t mention Covid-19. But 27 residents of the south Texas community had died from the virus that day, 22 the day before, and 35 the day before that.“I’ve never seen that ever in my life,” recalled John M Kreidler, a local funeral director, whose family has run Kreidler Funeral Home in McAllen for over a century.Hand-sanitizing machines and big bins with masks and gloves surround shoppers at the regional grocery store. Outside of Nomad Shrine Club, a rundown event space turned drive-thru pop-up, residents join a long line of people in cars in search of a Covid-19 test with rapid results. Even Tex Mex, a gentlemen’s club, has a somber message for patrons: “Clothed Again.”“The Rio Grande Valley has become the hotspot of a hotspot of a hotspot,” said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo county’s health authority and a practicing clinician. “We’re at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States.”In the United States, where the prevailing mantra for physicians is “do no harm”, that kind of ruthless calculation strikes deep, especially when so many of the lives at stake are medically vulnerable and easily exploited.In Hidalgo county – “a poor, fat, diabetic population”, Melendez said bluntly – nearly one in three people under age 65 lack health insurance. Thirty per cent live in poverty, and a 2020 WalletHub report found that three local cities hold the distinction as the “fattest” metropolitan area in the nation.Hidalgo county also sits along the US-Mexico border, and an estimated 102,000 unauthorized immigrants who may be afraid to seek care exist within its margins. Large families serve as an ideal vector for the virus, as do those who still flock to beaches and flea markets on weekends.Already, 467 members of the community have died from Covid-19, according to the county, most of them since Texas reopened in May. But the state government has actively thwarted efforts to go back into lockdown, prioritizing economic vitality even as the death toll soars.Leonardo Tremari worries about going to his job inside a Walmart supercenter in McAllen, but he – and countless other employees – still have to work. “I don’t have a choice,” he told the , laughing tensely.Last week, Hidalgo county judge Richard F Cortez ordered residents to stay home and encouraged non-essential businesses to limit their services. But a spokesperson for the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, quickly undermined Cortez’s authority, saying it was “simply a recommendation”. The dizzying policy ping-pong is an extension of a larger politicization of the pandemic nationwide during an election year, where just suggesting wearing a face mask has become a partisan dog whistle.Some people in Hidalgo county remain convinced that the current health crisis is made up or overblown, despite the fact that by now, everyone is at most a few degrees of separation from someone who has suffered or died because of Covid-19, Melendez said. More than 15,000 people have tested positive in the county, and last week, hospitals teemed with over a thousand patients stricken by the virus.In a matter of weeks, Melendez has put his sixth-grade teacher on life support, opened up a body bag to play a son’s farewell video for a patient who had already died, and stumbled upon a gravely ill nurse he’d known for 30 years, whom he didn’t even recognize at first glance. Harrowing personal moments abound, as do thorny gray areas.“There’s a moral, ethical dilemma at every place that we turn,” he said.Hospital emergency departments are struggling to cope, so other wings have morphed into Covid units – even when they aren’t equipped to do so. One healthcare worker at DHR Health in Edinburg, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described patients in hallways, two people to a room and “everything askew at all times” in a rehabilitation facility that has been converted amid the health emergency. The building isn’t made to provide so much life-sustaining oxygen, they said, and one time, it simply shut off.“Everybody here who is a healthcare professional feels very powerless,” they said. “We’re just trying to help do what we can with the horrible resources we’ve been given.”But anxious locals seek out diagnoses anyway. At Nomad Shrine Club, where results take minutes instead of days, members of the public arrive as early as 2 or 3am just to nab one of 300 daily tickets available for a test. A few blocks down the road, another, competing tent operation fielded so much demand that it rented out a larger parking lot.Both testing services charge fees, either $75 or $125. Neither takes insurance.Most patients just say they’re feeling down, said Genesis Gonzalez, a medical assistant who works at the tent. “Next thing you know, they come back positive.”As Gonzalez baked under the Texas sun, she wore short-sleeved scrubs and a mask, her hair tied back neatly. She and her colleagues have access to more comprehensive protective gear, she said, but some of them get dizzy or faint if they wear it in 101-degree weather.“I tell ’em, you know, ‘I have no idea what your loss feels like, and I’m so incredibly sorry for that loss,’” Garza said. “But I’m proud of them for coming themselves to get tested so that they won’t go out and expose other people. That’s really hard to do.”At Kreidler’s funeral home, corpses wrapped in sheets, then double-bagged and wrapped again lie across tables in the preparation room because there’s no space left in the cooler. The crematory is fully booked up to 10 days in advance.Kreidler and his staff, including his wife and son, sometimes work into the night without much sleep or regular meals. They’re constantly in a rush, and every time a body leaves, it just means another spot has opened up.“We’re wanting the pandemic to go away,” said the weary funeral director, who’s fed up with how the crisis has been manipulated as a “political football”.“We need to get this stopped – and stopped now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dc906a3f58a5b67c14d81df97067aa91dc99504/0_182_5362_3217/master/5362.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d84bcec09c654550492c90551c735da5","title":"half of mumbais slum residents have had coronavirus study","story":"India is the third-worst hit country in the world, but there are concerns a lack of testing could mean the true figure is far higherOver half the people living in the slums of Mumbai have had the coronavirus, according to a city-commissioned study that raises fresh doubts about India’s official case numbers.India is already the third-worst hit country after the US and Brazil, with nearly 1.5 million cases, though experts have previously said the lack of testing could mean the true tally is much higher.The city of 20 million people is home to India’s largest slum, Dharavi, where an estimated million people live. But deaths in the sprawling slum have not exploded, with local officials saying their aggressive efforts to stem the spread of the virus has been effective.The survey results suggested asymptomatic infections were “likely to be a high proportion of all infections” and also indicated the virus death rate was likely to be “very low”, the study said.The Mumbai survey came a week after an antibody study commissioned by the government suggested that almost a quarter of people in the capital New Delhi, home to 20 million people, have had the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e890cb2689be785c1a094f5fb1c66e9ebd3b9d16/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c475b5de7184a621cd84b6cff62d4568","title":"seth rogen israel palestinians jewish actor","story":"Actor says when he was younger he wasn’t told Palestinians lived on land that became the Jewish stateSeth Rogen has said he was “fed a huge amount of lies about Israel” as a young Jewish person, stoking controversy around the country’s sometimes fraught relationship with many North American Jews.The Canadian-US actor, who attended Jewish camp and whose parents met on a kibbutz in Israel, said the fact that the Jewish state was created on land where Palestinians were living had always been omitted.“They never tell you that, ‘Oh, by the way, there were people there’. They make it seem like it was just like sitting there, like the fucking door’s open.”More than 700,000 Palestinians were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Today, those families and their descendants make up around 5.6 million refugees.Rogen and Maron, who is also Jewish, were speaking to promote Rogen’s new comedy, An American Pickle, which tells the story of a Jewish immigrant from the 1920s who falls into a vat of brine and wakes up in modern-day Brooklyn.The pair talked and joked at length about Israel and also spoke about antisemitism, which Rogen said remains pervasive and prevalent.“I remember my dad frankly telling me, ‘People hate Jews. Just be aware of that. They just do.’ And it’s honestly something that I am so glad was instilled in me from a young age. Because if it wasn’t, I would constantly be shocked at how much motherfuckers hate Jews.”Zionists have pointed to the Holocaust and centuries of bloody antisemitism as evidence that Jews will never be safe without a state. Rogen, however, argued, “you don’t keep something you’re trying to preserve all in one place”.Asked if he would ever go to live in Israel, Rogen said no. Maron replied: “I’m the same way, and we’re gonna piss off a bunch of Jews.”Lahav Harkov, a senior contributing editor to the Jerusalem Post newspaper, criticised Rogen’s comments on Twitter, saying they were “made from a position of really, really great privilege – and ignorance - if he can’t understand why Israel makes sense to millions of Jews around the world”.Among Zionists, there is anxiety that North American Jews, who could possibly outnumber Israeli Jews, are becoming less supportive of the Jewish state, even as surveys often show the opposite.The debate has frequently reignited after high-profile figures, often Jewish, express views that are highly critical of Israel.Most recently, Peter Beinart, a prominent Jewish American political commentator, was both derided and lauded for commentaries in which he questioned whether he could remain both a liberal and also support the Jewish state while millions of Palestinians continued to be denied basic rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5783571682f008ed5e337d8e863946e6593fd0eb/0_273_4655_2794/master/4655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f59b8004b862b4eedaa5b8f481df5e2c","title":"vietnam on high alert coronavirus cases major cities hanoi","story":"First local case in three months reported over the weekend in holiday spot of Da NangVietnam is on high alert and bracing for a rise in coronavirus cases, after local media reported that infections have been detected in the capital, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands region.The country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned on Wednesday that every province and every city was at risk, adding that the new “wave” appeared to be different to that seen in Vietnam earlier this year.Vietnam, which has been praised for its response to the pandemic, reported its first local case for more than three months last weekend, after a man in the central city of Da Nang became ill. Officials have said that the recent infections involve a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country, and which seemed to be more virulent.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, while two cases have been confirmed in Ho Chi Minh City, and one has been reported in both Hanoi and Central Highlands. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phuc as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 450 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.This figure does not include 140 construction workers infected with Covid-19 who were evacuated from Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday, and who will be treated at a hospital outside Hanoi.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration. Vietnam remains shut to most foreign travellers, and anyone who enters the country must quarantine on arrival.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Tillage has strong environmental benefits compared to other types of farming, report saysFacility means fusion takes step towards generating clean energy source at scaleEcocide \u0026ndash the deliberate destruction of ecosystems \u0026ndash must be seen as the worst crime against humanity and nature"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Getty The Government is unlikely to review countries on its so-called green list or to consider regional travel corridors, in spite of some states experiencing big increases in Covid-19 cases recently, it has been confirmed.It is to stick to a fortnightly review of countries considered safe to travel to. The list was drawn up at a Cabinet meeting on July 21st based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), and it will be August 4th at the earliest before it will re-examine the list, though some countries significantly exceed the Irish case rate.The latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Control confirm the extent of sharp rises in some green list countries since July 21st, based on cases per 100,000 people over 14 days. Malta was the safest country, but cases have increased six-fold since then to 6.9 per 100,000, compared to Ireland, which is currently at 5.3.Low populationAs of Wednesday, Monaco has seen an 800 per cent increase to 27 per 100,000, though this is where there is a low population, while Cyprus have gone from 3.7 to 5.1. Finland has increased from 0.9 to 2.Travel to regions less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic within countries that are not themselves on the green list is “unlikely” to be approved by the Government. Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, said the Government is making its assessment for inclusion on the green list based on countrywide data.“We have been looking at it at a national level, that’s the most reliable, and once someone enters a country, we don’t really know where they go, so we’re operating on the national data,” she said at a Government briefing.She said the Cabinet may discuss the issue again when it next week considers the update to the list, but Ms Canavan said the criteria being applied includes “the national 14-day incidence rate, the trajectory, and other aspects of testing and tracing, so it was a broader range, but it was never looking at regional level.”A Department of Health spokeswoman said Nphet’s advice remains that all non-essential travel should be avoided. “Like all public health advice, this is kept under constant review. Any updated advice from Nphet is sent to Government for their consideration,” she added.Quarantine listThe UK government, however, has indicated it is prepared to look at a regional travel corridor to the Spanish islands, though it may add Luxembourg and Croatia to its Covid-19 quarantine list. The Covid operations committee will review “the air bridge system” on Friday.Transport minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton confirmed the idea was being investigated after pressure from Madrid over the change to travel advice made by the government over the weekend.The Spanish government has been lobbying their Irish counterparts for the inclusion of the Balearic Islands, including Mallorca and Ibiza, and the Canary Islands, on Ireland’s green list.The islands are currently excluded, along with the Spanish mainland, meaning anyone travelling into the State from these locations is asked to restrict their movements for 14 days on arrival. It has insisted lower levels of infection in the islands mean they are safe to travel to.Meanwhile Ryanair has declined to comment on its legal action against the Government in relation to the list. “We don’t comment on pending legal matters,” a spokeswoman said.Legal action threatenedThe airline has threatened legal action against the Government if it fails to expand the list of countries to which Irish travellers can go, include Britain and all EU member states.“The idea (which underlines Ireland’s green list) that the major economies of Europe are not dealing effectively with C-19 will do huge damage to our relations with those countries,” it said in a submission to the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response this week.“Ireland is an integrated part of the EU economy and if we lose this opportunity to restart, then we will pay for it with economic decline and massive increases in unemployment,” it added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316865.1596050534!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pup explainer what s the latest on pandemic payment squabble","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople can now travel to green list countries if they are on the pandemic unemployment payment, or other forms of unemployment assistance. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinWhat happened on Wednesday morning? Firstly, the Government U-turned. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys confirmed saying that those on unemployment assistance can travel to green list countries without their payment being interrupted.How is this different from before? On Tuesday night, Ms Humphreys was arguing the opposite, saying that PUP and other jobseekers’ payments are available only to those in the country. The traditional flexibility for holidays was suspended since July 10th.So now, what’s the bottom line? People can travel to green list countries if they are on the pandemic unemployment payment, or other forms of unemployment assistance. However, anyone leaving the State permanently, or going to a non-green list country for non-essential reasons will still lose it.What about people who have already lost their payment for going on holiday? Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Ms Humphreys have promised a review. Just how the review will proceed, how long it will take, and what refunds it will make, if any, is unclear. However, the Department of Social Protection is asking those who feel wronged to contact it.How many people might be affected by that anyway? We only have Government statements to go on, not published data, but Ms Humphreys has said 90 per cent of the 2,500 or so who have had payments suspended had left the State permanently. That suggests only 250 or so could be holidaymakers. It’s not clear exactly, though, how Social Protection tells the difference between someone leaving permanently and a holidaymaker.And what about quarantining? This issue has receded into the background a little. Earlier this week, Social Protection said people quarantining after holidays could not claim unemployment assistance.Lawyers believe this is a flimsy argument, especially if it is withheld on the grounds that the person is not “genuinely seeking work”, since one could easily be doing that on the phone or internet.Are there any other legal issues? The PUP is being put on a statutory basis at the moment, so that should shore up the Government’s position for future cases. However, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) and the Free Legal Advice Clinics (Flac) all suggest that decisions made up to now could be challenged. If so, that requires someone to challenge them.What about data privacy issues? Earlier this week, there were concerns that Social Protection had harvested passenger data from the airport or airlines. However, it denies that, saying it gathers all of its information from social welfare inspectors working in the airport alongside gardaí.So that’s the end of that then? Not quite. Social Protection relies on a piece of legislation from 2012 which gives it the power to ask people questions at ports and airports, but they must have a reasonable suspicion that someone is trying to cheat the system.Flac has drawn attention to this need for an evidence-based suspicion, amid widely circulating reports of people being asked for their information at the airport.“Checks at the airport cannot be randomised or based on arbitrary criteria or happen by way of blanket checks on all passengers waiting for a flight,” it argues, adding that airport checks should be “quite rare”.Meanwhile, there is the Data Protection Commissioner. It has already asked Social Protection and lodged more after it got the first replies. We have not seen the last of this, not by any stretch.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317032.1596050228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sam mcconkey covid 19 is grumbling around young people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn Ireland  75 per cent of Covid-19 cases are now among those under 45, with a median age of 33.Covid-19 is “grumbling” around younger people in Ireland threatening a “big explosion” again through the older, more vulnerable population, an infectious diseases expert has warned.Prof Sam McConkey, head of the department of international health and tropical medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, said less vigilance because of lower numbers of cases risked sending the virus “wild” again.The current trend in confirmed cases is “very similar to what we had in February and March before we had large numbers of elderly people getting it, who sadly passed away from it,” he said.“This is the sort of grumbling of the virus among young healthy people, who are often minimally symptomatic.“The risk is that they inevitably meet with their parents and grandparents and older people and then in two or four weeks’ time it all goes wild in older people again.”Dr Ronan Glynn, the acting chief medical officer, said earlier this week that 75 per cent of cases are now among those under 45, with a median age of 33.While young people are unlikely to die from the virus, they are likely to spread it around, said Mr McConkey.‘Not there yet’“I think we can’t relax. I think some of us feel there are very few deaths now, the numbers are down a lot from March and April, so let’s just relax. I think that is very much the wrong message,” he said.Mr McConkey, who advocates suppressing the virus until there is zero unexplained community transmission, said Ireland is struggling to get to that stage.“We are not there yet. And unfortunately as long as we’ve got unexplained community transmission on the island, there will still be a risk of it going into a big explosion like we had in February and March,” he told Newstalk.Citing New Zealand as an example, Mr McConkey said zero unexplained community transmission could mean sports fans returning en masse to matches and “we get back more to normal”.“It is a matter of the whole population keeping together, keeping our message, social distancing and masks and so on,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317041.1596050643!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin adopts passive stance on all ireland health claims mcdonald","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDuring Taoiseach’s questions, Mary Lou McDonald called on Micheál  Martin to use the opportunity of the North-South council meeting to “bring your critique of the Northern position in terms of international travel and to debate it with your colleagues”.  File photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin clashed with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald in a row over his approach to an all-island health service when she accused him of taking a “passive stance”.Rejecting her allegation, he accused her of attempting to politicise every issue and that her approach was “always about politics, not the substance of the issue” and she was always “sloganeering”.The row comes ahead of the first North-South Ministerial Council meeting since 2016 on Friday which will discuss the differing approaches to travel restrictions adopted by the State and Northern Ireland in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.The council, which is to meet in Dublin, will also discuss Brexit.Mr Martin noted the meeting would be the first in three and a half years, adding: “I hope it will help us to create a structure for us to deal with the undoubted difficulties that Brexit has brought about.”He added: “We do need to navigate and manage the island in a post-Brexit situation.”During Taoiseach’s questions, Ms McDonald called on Mr Martin to use the opportunity of the North-South council meeting to “bring your critique of the Northern position in terms of international travel and to debate it with your colleagues”.Her party would support that because “we need a single-island system of protection because it is the only way we can get ahead of this virus”.‘Much stricter guidance’Mr Martin said, however, there were difficulties in adopting an all-island approach because of “much stricter guidance” in the Republic, where there are only 15 countries on the approved travel green list, compared to 58 in the North.They had to work towards a joint approach, but he added: “We do have to have a reality check in terms of what’s possible and what is not possible and we need to be honest with people”.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said a united Ireland would not be possible without a national health service. “Why would anyone from the North want to be part of a united Ireland when we have a dysfunctional health service?”The Dún Laoghaire TD said the Government also needed to separate Church and State, because the North would not unite when 90 per cent of schools in the Republic are controlled by the Catholic Church.The Taoiseach said the shared island unit being established in his department would look at how the two jurisdictions could use the other’s health service.When Mr Martin said he was looking to make “incremental progress” needed on a lot of issues, Ms McDonald accused him of taking a “passive stance” when an all-Ireland approach was needed to human health. She demanded: “We do it for animal health, why on earth don’t we do it for human health?”But the Taoiseach accused her of politicising every issue rather than dealing with the substance. He said he wanted to work with people in good faith and not “roil all this in endless political positioning” and “sloganeering”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316457.1596001716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public servants using covid 19 to lie on couch and watch box sets","story":"A Government backbencher has accused public servants of laziness and claimed that they are using the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to “lie on the couch and watch box sets”.

Photograph: Collins Recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) who travel to green list countries will still receive the payment, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys has told the Dáil.Ms Humphreys admitted her department could have communicated more effectively about PUP entitlements for those travelling overseas, and said the cases of all those who left the State for holidays would be reviewed.In a statement during Dáil question time, she told TDs she had asked “people who wish to travel on any of the countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payment”.But she said people who travel to the countries not on the green list can only do so for “essential reasons”.She pointed out that of the 2,500 people whose payments have been stopped, 90 per cent were leaving the country permanently.Ms Humphreys said the PUP was a “solidarity payment to protect people’s incomes at a time of national crisis and I strongly believe that any person who breached that solidarity by claiming a payment that they were not entitled to, because they were no longer living in the country, should have their payments stopped”.The Minister said that since the regulations relating to jobseekers were signed on July 10th the Government’s travel advice had changed with the publication of the green list.“I have now asked my officials to amend the regulations so that people on jobseekers who wish to travel to any countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payments.”The Minister said she had “listened to the concerns expressed in recent days in relation to people whose payment was stopped due to the fact that they were travelling abroad on holiday”. She said there were people who may have travelled abroad and “genuinely not being aware of the travel guidance or criteria which applies to PUP”.“I accept that my department could have communicated more effectively on this issue. For that reason I have directed my department to review all cases to date where people went on holiday and had their payment stopped.”She said, however, the payment was established on an emergency ad hoc basis and was paid as an exceptional needs payment.“My officials advised me that under this scheme there was no provision to receive payments while out of the country under any circumstances.”She said this would mean they could travel to countries on the green list and not have their payment cut. “As with jobseekers, persons travelling to countries outside the green list can only do so for essential reasons”, such as a bereavement or health reasons, she said.“If you inform your Intreo office in advance your payment will not be impacted.”Despite the announcement, clashes continued in the Dáil where Taoiseach Micheál Martin defended the withholding of the PUP from some people leaving the State.Mr Martin didn’t reference Ms Humphreys’ statement but said as few as 100 people had had their PUP payments stopped for holidays abroad and he called for “honesty and a degree of perspective”.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed the Government was “blatantly” discriminating against workers on the PUP. She said they could not go on holidays they might have paid for last year but “the billionaire classes, the tax exiles have been accommodated.“No penalty for them, not a chance” and this was “utter hypocrisy”, he she added. Nobody should be travelling abroad but if they were penalised for doing so the penalties should be universal.She added “it seems to me that you acted outside the law”.Mr Martin said Ms McDonald “loves throwing accusations about the place”.Accusing the Sinn Féin leader of “play acting”, the Taoiseach pointed out that he had already said there should be a review of cases where payments had been cut to any holidaymakers.Rise TD Paul Murphy said the situation was “a shambles”. He referred to the statement by Ms Humphreys and said it appeared to be “at least a partial U-turn on the policy and leaves PUP recipients wondering has the discrimination being ended” and if that money would be reinstated.But, Mr Murphy said, the Taoiseach had just spent five minutes “speechifying” about everything other than the payment. “Can you please provide clarity?” he asked Mr Martin.The Taoiseach said “the assertion of shambles is wrong”. Mr Martin said he was not responsible for operational decisions and that people on the ground had responsibility for social protection.Controversy erupted after it emerged at the weekend that recipients of the €350 emergency payment were having the benefit docked for overseas travel.Last night, the Dáil passed legislation putting the PUP payment on a statutory basis and extending it to the end of March at a cost of €2.2 billion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317038.1596050455!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach urged to rebuke colleague over lazy public servants claim","story":"Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin has written to Micheál Martin about the comments by Sligo-Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry which he said were “wrong, offensive and isive”.Mr MacSharry had alleged that public sector productivity had fallen and this was “unacceptable” as he launched a broadside attack on “many elements of our State agencies, Government departments and local authorities” who he claimed were opportunistic in using the crisis “to do nothing”.The Fianna Fáil TD said he had had “dealings” recently with one State agency “where no one will be back in that office until the end of August”.

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

A senior group of Irish-American political and cultural leaders has urged Irish-Americans to boycott the sale of “Irish Lives Matter” T-shirts in the United States.Walmart and Amazon are selling a selection of T-shirts, some in green, emblazoned with the slogan – a rewording of the phrase Black Lives Matter that has become a rallying cry for racial justice in the United States following the death of African-American man George Floyd at the hands of white police officers in May.“While some may try to excuse such tee shirts as merely an exhibition of ethnic pride, we believe at best that they are tone deaf and insensitive, and at worst a deliberate, cynical attempt to trivialize, diminish or denigrate the BLM. We urge Irish Americans to boycott these sales,” the letter states.The Irish-American association, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, has also called out Amazon on stocking the products, accusing the company of insulting “two heritages for one low price”.“The hypocrisy of Mr. Bezos’ publicly virtue signaling on Amazon’s policy of respect and ersity while continually peddling prejudice for profit is cynically hypocritical,” the organisation said, referring to Amazon owner Jeff Bezos.Among the signatories of the letter sent to mark the passing of former congressman John Lewis are current members of Congress Joe Kennedy III, Richard Neal and Brendan Boyle, as well as former ambassadors, academic leaders and cultural figures including novelist Colm Tóibín.Northern Ireland linksOutlining the links between the American civil rights movement of the 1960s and the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967, the letter outlines how senior figures in the peace process including John Hume drew inspiration from figures such as Martin Luther King jnr.The letter also recalls the 2014 visit of John Lewis to the island of Ireland, when he led a march over the peace bridge in Derry and delivered the Frederick Douglass address at Iveagh House in Dublin.“John Lewis is well remembered by our Irish American community for his staunch support for the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and all through the Troubles.”The letter notes that Irish America “still has much to learn about the depths of discrimination faced by our African American brothers and sisters. And we have our own history of racial prejudice that we must examine and acknowledge.”The letter comes amid new initiatives at higher-education institutions in the United States including Glucksman Ireland House and the Irish consulate in New York to highlight the Irish heritage of many African-Americans.Though precise figures are difficult to establish, it is estimated that up to 38 per cent of African-Americans have Irish ancestry.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316895.1596043444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to start pulling 12 000 troops out of germany in weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS soldiers in a  military training area in  southern Germany. The US is to   cut  its military presence in Germany by 11,900 troops. Photograph:  Getty ImagesThe Trump administration is pulling nearly 12,000 troops out of Germany in a move set to add to tensions within Nato. The decision comes after President Donald Trump last month vowed to cap US troops stationed in Germany at 25,000 unless Berlin spent more on defence for the transatlantic security alliance. Defence secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday that the US would start withdrawing about 11,900 troops “in a matter of weeks”, with about 5,400 relocating to other places in Europe and about 6,400 due to head back to the US. About 24,000 US troops will remain in Germany.He told reporters the reduction would see some troops move east and “strengthen Nato, enhance the deterrence of Russia, and meet the other principles”, including reassuring allies.However, critics have warned US withdrawal would undermine a strong symbol of Washington’s commitment to its European allies and embolden Russia, which has in the past been keen to exploit isions between Nato members.Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security think tank, said the decision was “a mistake”.“The administration has offered no real rationale for the change other than as retribution for a Germany it sees as insufficiently committed to defence spending,” he said, adding that shifting units and installations from Germany to other European countries would be costly and undermine efforts to unify Nato allies.Mr Trump on Wednesday described Germany as “delinquent”, asking why the US would keep all its troops there when it fell short on its spending commitments to Nato. Germany has “taken advantage of us for many years”, he told reporters. Nato membersGermany spent 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product on defence last year and is among the Nato members that have committed to meet a 2 per cent threshold by 2024.A senior US defence official said it would cost potentially “billions of dollars” to build new housing on American soil for the returning US troops, although some of the 6,400 troops might return to Europe on a rotational basis.Pentagon officials justified the decision by saying Germany was no longer “a frontline country” for US operations in Europe, and now serves as the central logistics hub.General John Hyten, vice-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said on Wednesday the troop reallocation would “bolster” US commitment to its allies because it would “better distribute forces across Europe and increase the use of rotational forces”. While critics said the move was likely to embolden Russian ambitions in Europe, a senior defence official said relocating troops would allow the US to react to “very aggressive Russian activity... and also increasingly aggressive Chinese posture in the Mediterranean, in southeastern Europe”.Mr Esper described the shift as “a strategic laydown”, with the US redeploying troops “east into Poland”. He said there were also opportunities to move into the Baltics.The headquarters of the US’s European combatant command, along with its US special operations European command, would also move out of Germany and “co-locate” with other existing Nato headquarters in Belgium and Italy. Despite framing the shift as a strategic effort to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in Europe, Mr Esper was also critical of Berlin. “Germany is the wealthiest country in Europe. Germany can and should pay more to its defence,” he said. Defence spendingThe Trump administration has been at odds with chancellor Angela Merkel’s government in Germany over a host of issues, from defence spending and climate change to responses to China’s Hong Kong policy.Some German media had earlier suggested Mr Trump had decided to withdraw troops in a fit of pique after Dr Merkel declined to attend a G7 summit he intended to host last month in the US, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Richard Grenell, who recently stepped down as US ambassador to Germany after two years in the job, told German media last month there was no connection.Thomas Wright, an expert in transatlantic relations at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said: “This is all to do with Donald Trump’s deep-seated psychological hostility to Germany in general and Angela Merkel in particular. There’s no strategy.”The Pentagon has spent months evaluating the number of troops stationed in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and Europe, in line with Mr Trump’s call to bring back US troops. Officials said Mr Trump had made pulling troops from Germany his priority, and the US department of defence “moved to implement” that. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"belgium luxembourg among brace countries covid rates may lead","story":"Luxembourg and Belgium are at risk of having quarantine reimposed by the Government as their coronavirus rates rise, an analysis by The  suggests.As the Government finalises its weekly review of air bridges, due on Friday, the analysis shows that both Luxembourg and Belgium have seen week-on-week rises in Covid-19 rates to post-lockdown peaks.At least four other countries have rising rates, with Croatia also on an unofficial watchlist following the travel chaos sparked when the Government reimposed quarantine on Spain at the weekend, upturning the holiday plans of up to 1.8 million Britons.On Tuesday, Boris Johnson warned of signs of a second wave of coronavirus in Europe as he defended the 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain.  Belgium has seen its weekly Covid-19 rate rise from 5.3 to 15.1 per 100,000 of the population since the beginning of July, with cases up from 615 to 1,751.The spike in infections has led to Belgium\u0027s government tightening social restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus.Sophie Wilmes, the Belgian prime minister, said that, from Wednesday, a family or those living together can meet only the same five people from outside their household over the next four weeks. Antwerp has introduced a curfew.Luxembourg, which is bordered by Belgium to the north and west, has seen its weekly rates per 100,000 rise from 45.7 to 114.4, with the number of cases up from 286 to 716 in the same period. Use the interactive chart below to explore the infection rate across Europe:Other countries apparently at risk because of rising rates and post-lockdown peaks are the Bahamas, Monaco, Gibraltar and the Czech Republic. There is concern within the Government about Croatia, a major holiday destination for Britons, which is in the top 15 of the UK\u0027s list of quarantine-free countries with its rate of 12.4 per 100,000. This is, however, down on the previous week\u0027s.Mr Johnson said on Tuesday that the Government had to be swift in its response to spikes in coronavirus, and hinted at further action against other countries if necessary.Speaking during a visit to Nottinghamshire, the Prime Minister said: What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again.Let\u0027s be absolutely clear about what\u0027s happening in Europe. Amongst some of our European friends, I\u0027m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic.It came as the UK reported a further 119 coronavirus deaths – taking the official number of deaths so far to 45,878 – but the daily figure is typically higher on Tuesdays due to delays in reporting deaths at the weekend.Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) regional director for Europe, said there had been a slight uptick in new cases in the past couple of weeks in Europe as a result of an increasing number of countries experiencing localised outbreaks.He said this appeared to be driven by a higher proportion of new infections among young people who don\u0027t want to miss summer and were more likely to be mixing at parties, bars and clubs.They have a responsibility to themselves, parents, grandparents and communities. We do know how important good health behaviours are. Let\u0027s take advantage of that knowledge, he said.It comes as Heathrow\u0027s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, urged the Government to press ahead with airport tests of passengers for Covid-19 to help rescue summer and revive the economy.We need to find a way of getting \u0027red countries\u0027 opened up again. Testing is the only viable way of doing that in the absence of a vaccine, Mr Holland-Kaye told The  in an exclusive interview.A lot of countries which are red listed have millions of people who don’t have the disease and can’t travel.

In an interview with Sky News, he said: I just want to apologise for generalising and going outside of the people who I was talking to within the workspace and workplace I work in.My comments should not have been directed to all Jews or Jewish people. I want to apologise for generalising, and I want to apologise for comments that were looked at as anti-Semitic.He added he was not racist and the row was between him and his manager.He said: I\u0027m not racist, you know. I\u0027m a businessman. My thing should have stayed between me and my manager, I get that.A Twitter spokesman said: Upon further investigation, our teams have permanently suspended the account in question for repeated violations of our hateful conduct policy.Let us be clear: hateful conduct has absolutely no place on our service and we strongly condemn anti-Semitism. We are sorry we did not move faster and are continuing to assess the situation internally. It added: We deeply respect the concerns shared by the Jewish community and online safety advocates, and we will continue to work closely with governments, NGOs, civil society partners and our industry peers to tackle anti-Semitism on Twitter.The Campaign Against Antisemitism welcomed the news that Twitter has finally listened, but said the action was too little, too late.Mr Corbyn was contacted for comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new head mi6 announced","story":"The new head of MI6 will be Richard Moore, the Foreign Office has announced. Known as \u0027C\u0027, Mr Moore will succeed Sir Alex Younger, who will leave the Service in the autumn.Mr Moore joined the Secret Intelligence Service, Britain\u0027s overseas spy agency better known as MI6, in 1987. He currently serves as the Director General for Political Affairs in the FCO, a post he has held since April 2018.A fluent Turkish speaker, Mr Moore often tweets in the language and is a regular user of the social media platform.In recent years the intelligence agencies have been keen to increase their public profiles.GCHQ, Britain’s cyber spy agency, has avowed the National Cyber Security Centre as its public-facing arm.The Cheltenham-based agency also regularly uses twitter to set the public cryptic puzzles. This is mainly for recruitment purposes.Both MI5 and MI6 have websites but neither use twitter. It is unlikely Mr Moore will maintain a public social media profile when he takes up his new post.Mr Moore said: “I am pleased and honoured to be asked to return to lead my Service. SIS plays a vital role - with MI5 and GCHQ - in keeping the British people safe and promoting UK interests overseas.  I look forward to continuing that work alongside the brave and dedicated team at SIS.”The new MI6 Chief served as British Ambassador to Turkey from January 2014 to December 2017, having served in the country earlier in his career from 1990 to 1992. Previously he was Director for Europe, Latin America and Globalisation from 2010 to 2012. He has had postings in Vietnam, Pakistan and Malaysia.Mr Moore previously held director roles in the Secret Intelligence Service and has been Deputy National Security Adviser in the Cabinet Office.Mr Moore was born in Libya. He has a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford University and, on leaving Oxford, won a Kennedy Scholarship for post-graduate study at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.In 2007, he attended the Stanford Executive Programme.The  understands Mr Moore was one of three candidates for the top job at MI6.Tom Hurd, 55, the son of former British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, had been tipped for the post.Speculation in the British press earlier this year suggested he would be the next \u0027C\u0027. Mr Hurd, a former contemporary of Boris Johnson at Eton and Oxford, is currently Director General of the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism.The third candidate was Dame Karen Pierce. She has recently been appointed the UK\u0027s ambassador to the US. She had been considered a runner for the MI6 job during her previous post as British Permanent Representative to the UN in New York.Married to Maggie, with 2 children, Mr Moore\u0027s interests include golf, hiking, scuba-ing, Turkish carpets and porcelain, and visiting historical sites.The announcement means that the heads of MI5 and MI6 will have changed over this year. In April this year Ken McCallum took over as head of MI5, in charge of domestic intelligence operations.The new spy chiefs have arrived at a turbulent time for Britain\u0027s national security. Brexit, Covid-19 and tensions with Russia and China have presented a particularly challenging combination for diplomatic and intelligence officials.Announcing Mr Moore\u0027s appointment, Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “I am delighted to appoint Richard as the next Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service.He returns to SIS with tremendous experience and will oversee the work of a group of men and women whose tireless efforts are rarely seen in public, but which are critical for the security and prosperity of the UK.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian scientists discover bones 10000 year old adult woolly","story":"Russian scientists are poring over the stunningly well-preserved bones of an adult woolly mammoth that roamed the earth at least 10,000 years ago, after local inhabitants discovered its remains in the shallows of a north Siberian lake.Part of its skull, several ribs and foreleg bones, some with soft tissue still attached to them, were retrieved from Russia\u0027s remote Yamal peninsula above the Arctic circle on July 23.Scientists are still searching the site for other bones.Similar finds in Russia\u0027s vast Siberian region have happened with increasing regularity as climate change warming the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world has thawed the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost.Scientists circulated images in December of a prehistoric puppy, thought to be 18,000 years old, that was found in the permafrost region of Russia\u0027s Far East in 2018.The mammoth remains are at least 10,000 years old, although researchers don\u0027t yet know exactly when it walked the earth or how old it was when it died, said Dmitry Frolov, director of the Scientific Centre for Arctic studies.Researchers have found mammoth fossils dating from up to 30,000 years ago in Russia, he said.Yevgeniya Khozyainova, a scientist from a local museum, said it was unusual to find so many bones belonging to a single species and to know where they came from.Of course, we\u0027d like to find the remaining parts, to understand how complete a find it is.

We have to be absolutely sure about the vaccine, he said in televised remarks.This is what we\u0027re going to proceed from before we make further decisions on coronavirus vaccination.Ms Golikova\u0027s remarks follow a CNN interview with the head of Russia\u0027s sovereign welfare fund, which bankrolls research and development for the coronavirus vaccine at the Gamalei Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.Mr Dmitriev said on Tuesday that the Gamaeli Institute is looking at August 10 as the earliest date to get approval, potentially making it the world\u0027s first approved vaccine.Russia will have got there first, he told CNN, likening the country\u0027s coronavirus research to the successful launch of the world\u0027s first satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957.The fund\u0027s spokesman confirmed Mr Dmitriev\u0027s remarks to The  but would not offer further detail. He has said he hopes for Russia to produce about 30 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year.Russia has also struck manufacturing deals with five other countries and could be producing up to 170 million doses abroad this year, he said.Mike Ryan, the executive director at the World Health Organisation, said earlier this months that there is a long way to go before the world gets its first approved vaccine.The British Government, in the meantime, has signed a deal with pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur for 60 million doses of a potential Covid-19 vaccine if the tests prove to be successful.The Gamalei Institute is a reputable research centre which has developed clinically approved vaccines against Mers and Ebola, but it has faced criticism from the scientific community after its director revealed that he and other staff self-administered the vaccine way before the start of human trials.Mr Dmitriev, a close ally of President Putin, has also said he and his family have tried the vaccine.Earlier this month, the UK\u0027s National Cyber Security Centre revealed that a Russian hacking group had attempted to steal vaccine research from the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.The Gamalei Institute, which announced a successful end of the first phase of human trials just days before the NCSC\u0027s announcement, vehemently denied a suggestion that Russian scientists might have benefited from the hack.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stonehenges giant sarsens came marlborough downs say archaeologists","story":"The prehistoric builders of Stonehenge are renowned for hauling the megalithic bluestones 140 miles from the Preseli Mountains in north Pembrokeshire, west Wales, to their final home on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire.However, perhaps the mammoth journey, roughly 4,500 years ago, proved too much for them – for when it came to later sourcing the larger sarsen stones, they looked closer to home.Archaeologists from English Heritage and the University of Sheffield have solved a centuries-old mystery and concluded that the sarsens originated in the West Woods of the Marlborough Downs, just 15 miles north of Stonehenge.It is not far from the Neolithic monument site of Avebury, and the area is likely to have been a significant or ritual landscape. The monument at Avebury is a Neolithic henge containing three stone circles, around the village of Avebury, Wiltshire.The breakthrough came when a piece of core – drilled from Stonehenge\u0027s Stone 58 during repair work in the 1950s – was returned to English Heritage from the US last year, which gave archaeologists the chance to analyse the chemical make-up without damaging the monument.English Heritage historian Susan Greaney said: The bluestones we\u0027ve known come from mid-west Wales from the 1920s, and they were easy to source because there are inclusions and quartz which you can match to the outcrop. The large stones are pretty uniform and just look like a big block, so it\u0027s difficult to interrogate them and find where they are from. The new research used X-ray spectrometry to look at the very small trace elements, and it was found the Stonehenge sarsens matched those in the Marlborough Downs. The sarsens average approximately 20 tonnes but can be as heavy  as 30, and the largest is 30 feet long. There are no sarsens of this size left in the downs, that\u0027s why it\u0027s been such a mystery and some people have suggested they come from elsewhere as you get outcrops in other places where you have chalkland, like Decon and Kent,” Ms Greaney added. The West Wood was overlooked because its under ancient woodland, and a lot of sarsens were removed in the 19th century for roadstones, particularly in Swindon, but there are still sarsens buried in amongst the trees.To be able to pinpoint the area that Stonehenge’s builders used to source their materials around 2,500 BC is a real thrill.While the Preseli stones were probably chosen for ritual or location reasons, the sarsens were likely to have been picked for their size, archaeologists believe. But although 10 times shorter than the journey from Wales, moving 30 tonne stones would still have proven a tricky prospect and the sarsens may have moved on the River Avon for part of the way.We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size – they wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find and it made sense to get them from as nearby as possible, said Ms Greaney. This is in stark contrast to the source of the bluestones, where something quite different – a sacred connection to these mountains perhaps – was at play. Yet again, this evidence highlights just how carefully considered and deliberate the building of this phase of Stonehenge was.Professor David Nash, a geomorphologist from the University of Brighton, said: It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries.”The team is now hoping to carry out more survey work on the Marlborough Downs, looking for sarsen chips and wedges which might indicate where the original location of the stones.The research was published in the journal Science Advances.In 2008, the X-ray spectrometry technique was used to visualise the paint below Vincent van Gogh\u0027s Patch of Grass and pick out the inidual brush strokes as well as the  flesh tones of the hidden head of a woman.Cornell University has also used it to analyse inscriptions from Greek and Roman pottery. Carvings that have been entirely worn away on the surface can still be visible through the tiny amount of iron left by a chisel, allowing words to emerge from seemingly smooth stone.In 2011, an unfinished self-portrait of Rembrandt was discovered under another painting using X-ray fluorescence.Conservation experts used the technique to understand the origins of the 1,400-year-old Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of more than 3,500 Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered by a metal detector enthusiast in a field in Staffordshire in 2009.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us announces withdrawal 11000 troops delinquent germany","story":"The US has announced it is to withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany, in a move Donald Trump said was intended to punish the “delinquent” Nato member for not spending enough on defence.The US president had declared his intention last month to cut by about a third the 36,000-strong US troop contingent in Germany, faulting its ally for failing to meet the alliance’s spending target and accusing it of taking advantage of America on trade.Of the troops leaving - a mix of Army and Air Force units - some 5,400 will be relocated to Italy and elsewhere in Europe, while 6,400 forces will be returned to the US and will in time redeploy to the continent.As part of the shakeup, which is estimated to cost billions of dollars, the US’s European Command headquarters and Special Operations Command Europe will also be moved from Stuttgart to Belgium.Germany\u0027s Defense Ministry refused to comment on the moves, saying the plans needed to be discussed internally first.Mark Esper, US Defence Secretary, cast the decision as a way to “enhance deterrence against Russia” and strengthen Nato.However, Mr Trump later told journalists: “they\u0027re not paying their bills. It\u0027s very simple. They\u0027re delinquent. He added that he might rethink the decision to pull troops out of Germany if they start paying their bills.“We don’t want to be the suckers anymore,” he said. “The United States has been taken advantage of for 25 years, both on trade and on the military.”The president has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to pay bills, which is a misstatement of the issue. Nato nations have pledged to dedicate 2 per cent of their gross domestic product to defense spending by 2024, and Germany is still short of that goal, at about 1.4 per cent.Defence officials too yesterday insisted that the decision as to where to house the US troops leaving Germany was not influenced by whether the new host country was meeting the two per cent target.Belgium and Italy, the two countries that will be receiving US troops from Germany, spend an even smaller percentage on defence than Berlin does.Members of the Republican Party have criticised the move as a gift to Russia and a threat to US national security. It remains to be seen if Congress would approve the funds for such a major relocation and if the plan would remain intact if Joe Biden, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is elected.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western liberals covid myopia condemning worlds poorest","story":"Lockdown has polarised British society widening the gulf between the haves and have-nots, in a culture war yielding familiar tropes and characters. “Just stay at home, it’s not hard,” says the lawyer to the electrician. “Don’t sunbathe in the park!” cries Pandora from her Notting Hill townhouse. There is some truth in the caricature. But few have noted how the Pandora effect is also playing out on a monstrous global scale, inflicting unimaginable suffering. Around the world, lockdowns are pushing the already impoverished into outright destitution. Stay-at-home orders – bad enough for employees in countries with welfare states – become lethal for hand-to-mouth workers reliant on a daily income to survive. An estimated one billion people globally depend on money sent home from family members abroad, yet as millions have been laid off and confined, jobless, to their homes, remittances are projected to fall by a fifth this year in what the World Bank calls “the sharpest decline in recent history”. Environmentalists may rejoice at the plunge in air traffic, but the collapse in tourism has destroyed one highly effective way of transferring wealth from advanced economies to developing ones. Farmers in the developing world, unable to sell their produce, face ruin due to the destruction of global supply chains. Restrictions on movement, and a collapse in funding for humanitarian agencies, are blocking the distribution of aid to the neediest people on earth. Lockdown-associated economic turmoil is weighing particularly heavily on the young and vulnerable. In India, destitution is propelling desperate parents into the arms of human traffickers, with their false promises of lucrative jobs for children in mega-cities like New Delhi. According to the UN, Covid-linked malnutrition is causing the deaths of an additional 10,000 children a month. Tragically, lockdowns look set to kill many more youngsters than the virus itself.Such consequences, long predicted, are now too blatant to ignore. Yet the parochialism and narrow-mindedness of our debate has been extraordinary. Obsessing over the possibility of a second wave, our Government seems incapable of computing the economic consequences of not lifting lockdown, domestically and for the world beyond Europe. Despite the wildly differing circumstances, bodies such as the World Health Organisation have largely promoted the same, Western playbook of containment. Their advice ignores what should be core variables such as when stay-at-home orders mean confining millions in cramped, poorly sanitised conditions, or that the exorbitant human cost of an economic downturn will be greater with millions already below the poverty line. Even the comparatively young demographics of developing nations has been widely overlooked. There are alternatives to this clunky template. Primarily to avert economic meltdown, Pakistan rolled back many of its shutdown measures in a modified strategy designed to balance lives and livelihoods – an approach so far vindicated by falling case numbers. President Imran Khan has even broached the question of long-term coexistence with the virus – something few UK lawmakers have been bold enough to do.It may seem an odd concept, at a time of creeping poverty, but there is an air of luxury – even decadence – about our lockdown obsession. In a form of latter-day imperialism, countries that can afford to weather the economic storm (or believe they can) are demanding their model be imposed on impoverished countries for which it guarantees catastrophe. How ironic, yet how unsurprising, that Western liberals, immersed in identity politics and “check your privilege”, have ignored the unequal effects of lockdown on the global economy.It should require little imagination to perceive the colossal humanitarian harm of closing down entire societies and economies. Yet Covid myopia has blinded too many to the fact that decisions, policies and changes in consumer habits cannot be disentangled from the wider world. For months, those who raised such concerns have been shouted down by lockdown fanatics with cries of “one life is too many”. No longer. The developing world cannot afford to hunker down and await the virus’s eradication. Neither can we. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"black is king beyonce disney plus date lion king stream","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The album has been described as ‘a celebratory memoir on the Black experience’Beyoncé’s visual album Black is King is coming to Disney+ this week.The highly anticipated project has been written, directed and executive produced by Beyoncé and will premiere internationally on Friday 31 July.In a statement announcing the film, Disney and Beyoncé’s Parkwood Entertainment said Black is King is “a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA trailer for the film was released on 28 June.How to watch Black is KingBeyonce surprises fans with trailer for new film Black is KingBlack is King is exclusively available to stream on Disney+, meaning that you’ll need a Disney+ subscription to watch.A single month’s subscription costs £5.99, or viewers can save if they commit to a year for £59.99.Sadly, Disney+ no longer offers a seven-day free trial to new customers, having scrapped this deal in the run up to the release of Hamilton and Frozen 2 on the platform earlier this month.What is it about?Black is King has been described as “a story for the ages that informs and rebuilds the present”.“Black is King is an affirmation of a grand purpose, with lush visuals that celebrate black resilience and culture.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Archaeologists have solved one of Stonehenge’s greatest mysteries — the precise source of the world-famous prehistoric temple’s largest stones.A new scientific breakthrough has, for the first time, allowed geologists to pinpoint almost exactly where Stonehenge’s giant stone uprights and lintels came from.Up until now, all that archaeologists knew with reasonable certainty was that the stones (a type of rock known as sarsen) had been brought in around 2500BC by the great temple’s Neolithic builders from the Marlborough Downs or immediately adjacent areas — a 75 sq miles area, 15-25 miles north of Stonehenge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut now scientists from the University of Brighton have traced the stones to a small very specific two sq mile part of that range of hills — a patch of woodland just south of the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire.In prehistoric and indeed later times, that area (now known as West Woods) seems to have been strewn with particularly large sarsen boulders, geochemically identical to those used to build Stonehenge.Humans reached Americas 11,000 years earlier than previously thoughtRecent detailed examination of the West Woods area by Reading University archaeologist, Katy Whitaker, suggests that the builders of Stonehenge probably chose it as their source of stone because of the exceptional sizes and relative flatness of many of its sarsen boulders.New archaeological research about the site has revealed that even 1200 years before Stonehenge was built, the West Woods area’s great sarsen slabs were used to construct a massive local prehistoric tomb.Now that the source of Stonehenge’s great stones has finally been identified, archaeological attention is likely to turn to discovering the precise route used by the monument’s prehistoric builders to move the giant 20-40tn stones from West Woods to Stonehenge (a distance of around 15 miles).There are two main options — an eastern route down the Wiltshire Avon Valley and a western route across Salisbury Plain.The western option would have involved a short segment where they would have had to haul the boulders up a 14 per cent gradient for around 300m.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut the eastern option would probably have involved hauling the giant stones (around 80 of them) for at least six miles along a river valley through relatively dense woodland and scrub. It would almost certainly not have been possible to use a raft on that river (the Wiltshire Avon) because the width of raft required to transport such large boulders would almost certainly have been much greater than the width of the river itself.On the balance of probabilities, it’s perhaps more likely that the builders of Stonehenge opted for the western route, despite the need to haul the stones up a hill.That route would have taken them south from West Woods across the southern part of the Marlborough Downs and down a very steep hill into the Vale of Pewsey. They would then have taken what was perhaps an already ancient trackway past (or indeed through) a huge prehistoric ritual and ceremonial complex (at Marden) across the river Avon and then up onto Salisbury Plain.It was that ascent onto Salisbury Plain, which involved the only moderately steep part of the journey (the 14 per cent gradient). Then they would have crossed the relatively flat and unforested plain to Stonehenge itself.If they did opt for this, on balance easier, western route, then the fact that they (and their massive stones) would have passed by or through the Marden ritual complex is potentially significant.In architectural terms, Stonehenge was destined to be the most impressive religious complex in Neolithic Britain — but Marden may well have been the biggest.Archaeological investigations over recent years (led by archaeologist, Dr Jim Leary, now of the University of York) have revealed that the Marden complex consisted of three great monuments — a vast 500m diameter banked enclosure north of the River Avon, a huge roughly 20m tall, 70m diameter ceremonial mound in the centre of that enclosure — and another banked enclosure, south of the river, surrounded by a 100m diameter circle of massive 1m diameter wooden “obelisks”.Having discovered the source of the giant stones of Stonehenge, archaeologists may soon be in in a position to make another potentially significant discovery about more than 100 fragments of sarsen stone found at Marden.In deploying the same scientific techniques used to pinpoint the source of the Stonehenge sarsens, scientists may ultimately be able to discover where the Marden fragments came from. Detailed preliminary examination of those enigmatic fragments will begin later this year.Those fragments appear to have been gathered together in the Marden ritual complex at around the same time that the Stonehenge sarsens may have been passing through that monument.So if it were ultimately to turn out that the Marden fragments came from West Woods, then it is conceivable that those fragments may have been removed from Stonehenge-bound sarsen boulders — potentially to shape them (and thus reduce their weight) prior to their ascent onto Salisbury Plain.Sarsen stone, the type of rock used to build Stonehenge and Avebury stone circle, may well have been regarded as profoundly mysterious by prehistoric people — because they normally only occur as loose or semi-buried boulders, completely unconnected to any bedrock. Indeed, the bedrock in the Marlborough Downs is chalk — so the presence (back in the Neolithic) of hundreds of thousands of often huge boulders composed of an obviously totally different type of stone (sometimes even arranged in straight lines across the landscape) would have been seen by prehistoric people as unusual.Worldwide, anomalous stones have often been regarded by many cultures as spiritually and physically interchangeable with humans — sometimes with a belief that particular stones contained the souls, spirits or even the transformed mortal remains of the dead. The belief was widespread, occurring on virtually every continent.It is likely therefore that the builders of Stonehenge, Avebury and other stone circles perceived sarsen in both practical construction terms and also in more spiritual ones.In geological terms, sarsen is just a very hard sandstone. It was formed around 50 million years ago when fresh groundwater gradually deposited additional silica while flowing through sand deposits. In some places, that silica then acted as a natural “glue” to bind trillions of sand grains together, thus forming solid rock.When later erosion subsequently removed the surrounding “unglued” (ie loose) sand, all that was left were the sarsen boulders.Because the chemicals in the original sand varied from locality to locality, modern scientists have now been able to develop a way of producing very accurate chemical fingerprints for sarsen stones from different locations. The system has been developed by University of Brighton geomorphologist and geographer, Professor David Nash. He has now used it to solve the mystery of where Stonehenge’s sarsens came from. It’s the first time that sarsen “fingerprinting” has been used to solve a major archaeological puzzle. The new British Academy funded research is being published today by the American on-line free-access journal Science Advances.“It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries,” said Professor Nash.“We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size,” said English Heritage senior properties historian Susan Greaney.‘Astonishing’ discovery of ancient monument next to Stonehenge“The builders of Stonehenge wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find,” she added.As well as the giant sarsen stones, Stonehenge also has a significant number of much smaller stones (the so-called bluestones). Over the years, scientists have succeeded in demonstrating that those smaller (2-3tn) standing stones were brought by Stonehenge’s builders from southwest Wales.Professor Nash was able to analyse the Stonehenge sarsens because a core extracted from one of the monuments giant stones during repair work in the 1950s (and taken to America by one of the engineers involved in that work) was returned to English Heritage last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHow to support our campaignA chance to nab an otherwise sold-out edition (produced for Wallinger’s Whitechapel Gallery show in 2001): Wallinger’s screenprint was created by producing a black-and-white negative of George Stubbs’s painting Whistlejacket, with the addition of a narwhal’s horn, resulting in an image that reminds me of those 19th century fakery-photos of “fairies”. Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Since 2018, he has held the senior post of director general for political affairs at the Foreign Office.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnnouncing his appointment, the Foreign Office said only that his previous SIS service had involved “a range of roles across the service both in the UK and overseas”.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “I am delighted to appoint Richard as the next chief of the Secret Intelligence Service. He returns to SIS with tremendous experience and will oversee the work of a group of men and women whose tireless efforts are rarely seen in public, but which are critical for the security and prosperity of the UK.“I pay tribute to Sir Alex Younger for everything he has done during his time leading the Secret Intelligence Service.

It was marked by the normally publicity-shy “C” speaking out about the danger of cyberattacks and digital propaganda from hostile states such as Russia and raising questions about how “comfortable” the UK could be in its telecommunications network being reliant on technology from China’s Huawei.Born in Libya, Mr Moore has two children with his wife, Maggie, and outside work his interests include playing golf and watching cricket and rugby.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.York, Cardiff and Oxford are the greenest cities in the UK, a study has revealed.Researchers looked at the nation’s eco-friendly habits – taking into account a host of factors such as the tendency to buy refurbished items, recycling rates, methods of travel, and even time spent in the shower.Based on the responses of 2,286 adults on different aspects of sustainability, 27 cities were awarded points that were then tallied up – with the walled city of York achieving the highest overall score.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the musicMagpie study, York came top in the inidual category for the proportion of those who shop in zero-plastic supermarkets – sharing the spoils with Birmingham (31 per cent).And the northeast city also scored highest for the proportion of those who grow fruit and vegetables at home (72 per cent).Going green is more beneficial to the environment than you thinkSecond place belonged to Cardiff, which is home to the largest proportion of residents who buy or use refurbished technology (72 per cent) and also those who up-cycle old household items (68 per cent).Close behind was Oxford, which came third, followed by Plymouth in fourth, and Brighton and Newcastle in joint fifth.However, out of all 27 cities polled, Wolverhampton scored lowest behind Birmingham and Norwich.Liam Howley, from musicMagpie, said: “We all want to do our bit to help the environment, but some things are easier than others.“It’s interesting to see certain cities are definitely doing more than others, but at the same time nobody truly reigns supreme.“There is so much we can each take responsibility for to become more sustainable, and a lot of it is easier than you think.”The study also found 45 per cent of those polled don’t think they do enough to help the environment by reducing their carbon footprint.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brighton and Newcastle – 222 pointsOf those who feel this way, 28 per cent believe they cannot afford to be greener, while 17 per cent feel the area where they live doesn’t do enough to make it easier to be sustainable.However, those polled could turn to Wrexham and Aberdeen for a little inspiration – in two categories at least.Wrexham has the highest proportion of residents who recycle (83 per cent), with Birmingham at the other end of the scale with just 56 per cent.The north Wales city also got top marks for flying the least – 1.42 times a year on average – while those in Cardiff fly the most at 3.72 times a year.However, Wrexham also has the highest proportion of residents who drive petrol or diesel vehicles (75 per cent), with London the lowest with 44 per cent.While Aberdeen fared the best for using energy-saving light bulbs (98 per cent), Edinburgh and Norwich were joint-worst in this area (84 per cent).Aberdeen was also top of the tree when it comes to shopping for local produce (98 per cent), while Portsmouth scored lowest (70 per cent).It also emerged those living in Southampton spend the shortest amount of time in the shower – an average of seven minutes and seven seconds.In contrast, those living in Norwich spend the longest time in the shower on average – nine minutes and 59 seconds.Brighton came top for buying fruit and vegetables loose rather than in plastic packaging (48 per cent), while Southampton got the fewest points in this category (29 per cent).And finally, Portsmouth has the highest proportion of those who give to or buy from charity shops (71 per cent), with Swansea having the lowest (38 per cent).The musicMagpie study, carried out through OnePoll, also found half of those polled wish they knew more about how to reduce their carbon footprint further.But 17 per cent revealed they don’t know what information to trust.More than 1,300 English sites exceed annual pollution limitsMr Howley added: “One simple thing people can do to make a huge difference, is to consider how they are buying and recycling their tech.“Buying high quality, refurbished tech ensures the product continues its life-cycle when it is still fully functioning.“It also stops it from contributing to the increasing problem of e-waste, which is piling up in landfills across the world at an astonishing rate and contributing to 70 per cent of the toxic waste caused by landfill.  “Selling back your unused tech to be recycled or refurbished also reduces this problem and can make you some extra cash in the process.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A gridlock in the UK’s visa processing system has left people unable to work or travel to see dying relatives during the pandemic despite being legally resident, prompting renewed criticism of the Home Office’s privatised visa service.Hundreds and possibly thousands of foreign nationals have been left in a “state of limbo” after being informed that although visa centres have reopened, they must continue to wait before they can proceed with submitting their biometrics.Foreign nationals in the UK are required to submit their biometric information, such as fingerprints, in order to obtain a visa. This process usually takes place in centres across the country run by firm Sopra Steria, which is contracted by the Home Office to deliver the service.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore the private company took over the contract last year, applicants could go to their local post office to provide biometric data. Under Sopra Steria’s service, they must attend one of six “core centres” across the country that offer a free service, or one of another 51 that usually charge a fee starting from £69.99.However, these centres were closed in March because of the lockdown, putting the process on hold. A phased reopening of the centres began on 1 June, but nearly two months on, many applicants are still “in limbo”.People left without proof of UK status as visa centre fees soarAt the start of July, the Home Office informed applicants who had previously applied for UK visas that they would be put through a new process which would reuse biometrics they had submitted previously, and that therefore they could not book an appointment at one of the visa centres. But there has been no update since on when this new process will begin.Meanwhile, first-time applicants, who can still book appointments, have found that there are no free appointments being offered by Sopra Steria, despite the fact that all core centres are supposed to provide slots without charge. This has left some unable to afford to submit their biometrics, or having to travel long distances to do so.David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), told The Independent there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this situation.“Without having that current, valid immigration document, people run into difficulties. People don’t have the documents and they don’t have anything else they can use to prove their right to be here,” he said.“Although in theory an employer or a landlord could contact the Home Office to check their immigration status, they’re not likely to, and even if they do, the Home Office sometimes get it wrong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Pountney said the lack of clarity around the new system of reusing biometrics was making it “impossible” to advise clients: “Clients keep asking us when something is going to happen, and we just don’t know. We’ve got no clarity on who is likely to be covered by this new system or what the process is, so we have to play it by ear.”Andrew Tingley, partner and head of immigration at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, said: “Thousand of applicants are currently in limbo as a result of the Home Office policy of allowing the re-use of biometrics.” He argued that visa applicants should be given the choice on whether to opt into the new system of reusing biometrics.Filipino national Sharon Phillips, 32, moved to the UK in December 2019 to join her husband Hywel on a six-month finance visa. They married in February and applied for her spouse visa in May, but the closure of visa centres meant she couldn’t submit her biometrics at the time.The couple assumed that once the centres opened in June, they would be able to continue with the process, but they are still waiting – and until Sharon obtains her spouse visa, she is unable to work.Sharon, who worked as a domestic worker in Malaysia before she came to the UK, said: “It’s frustrating. I can’t work. I can’t travel. I can’t do anything right now. I was hoping to work in a care home. I know there are vacancies in care homes at the moment. I want to, but what do I do?“Financially I don’t have anything right now. I’m totally reliant on my husband. He’s also supporting my family back home in the Philippines.“I’m just at home. I have nothing to look forward to. I’m hoping none of my family get sick because if that happens, I won’t be able to go back home to see them. We’re just waiting and waiting. I’m just stuck in limbo.”Hywel, 31, who met Sharon while studying in Malaysia, said: “It’s hard to believe that they shut down all visa processing for three months, when it’s such an essential service. And it looks like there was no forward thinking about how to deal with the backlog once it reopened.“We’ve been trying to wait patiently, but there’s so much uncertainty. We’ve now been told we have to go down this path of reusing biometrics, but it’s a new system that hasn’t been tested, and there’s no date for it yet. Will it be one more month? Will it be three more months? We really don’t know how long this will take.”Emre and Elif Gunes said they were feeling “desperate” because, as a result of the delays, they have been unable to travel to Turkey to visit Elif’s father, who has cancer and has been in a critical state since 13 July.The Turkish couple, both of whom work as engineers in the UK, applied for an extension in April as the visas were set to expire on 19 June, but – although the process should normally take a few weeks – they still haven’t been able to submit their biometrics in order to complete the process.They were hopeful when Sopra Steria announced on 1 June that appointments would be allocated by the order of the application submission dates, but they have since been told that they will be going through the new process of reusing previously submitted biometrics, and have been given no time frame as to when it will be up and running.Elif, 29, said: ”I feel guilt and desperation every second of every day knowing that my family needs my support more than ever before, but I cannot promise them I will be there soon. This adds another unbearable dimension to my existing sorrow and fears.“My heart beats fast whenever my phone rings, not only because I am scared to hear any more bad news about my father’s situation but also I do not know what is going to happen to my job and life here if I choose to go home. Do I have to leave my job and life behind just because this visa extension process is not working properly? This is the pressure I am under constantly.”Emre, 31, said that on top of the distress of being unable to see his father-in-law, he was concerned about losing his job and, in the current situation, being unable to find a new one: “It was already too much stress for me. What I am going to do if I lose my job due to the pandemic? Will it be possible to find a new job with sponsorship?”Debasish Dash, a mathematician who has been working in the UK since 2016, has been unable to take up a job as a lecturer at Strathclyde University, which he was supposed to start at the beginning of July, because it has not been possible for him to complete the visa process.The 33-year-old Indian national, who applied for a Global Talent Visa – which the government introduced in February to attract “talented and promising iniduals in specific sectors” – is currently working at Cambridge University in a job that he was supposed to have left a month ago. The university has been able to source additional research funding for him to continue, but this will end in August.“I will be unemployed. Researchers are not paid a lot. Because of the government’s mistake I’ll have to dig into my savings and start paying my rent and my bills from my savings. It just makes no sense,” he said.“It’s nonsense. Everything was in place for me to start the new job in July, but now I don’t know how long I will have to wait because the government is not telling us anything.“Banks and post offices were open. Why were visa centres closed for two months? Even since they’ve opened, why is there a complete lack of urgency? They’re very slow and they’re giving us no time frame. They’re trying to attract talented people, yet they’re putting me through this stress.”Another Indian national, who didn’t want to be named, said he was afraid to go outside in case anyone in authority requested to see his residence permit, which he is currently unable to provide because his visa ran out on 30 May, and he hasn’t been able to process his new one because has been told to wait for the new biometrics service.The 25-year-old, who moved to the UK in January 2017 and works in the IT sector, said: “I find it tough to go out because police may ask for your permit to stay in the UK and I don’t have that. I’ve hardly been out in the last two months.“I’m worried. I don’t have any proof of my status to show I’m eligible to be in this country. I can’t do anything. It’s important to have freedom and to have a visa to show you’re allowed to be in this country. What we’re going through is something no one is noticing.”The young man said he was also distressed by the fact that his sister had recently given birth to her first child in India, and he had been unable to travel to see his family.A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: “We recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.”They confirmed that the firm was looking to introduce new measures involving the reuse of fingerprint biometrics that have been recorded in a previous application, and said more information would be provided on this “very soon”.The spokesperson said that since the phased reopening of centres on 1 June, the company had made “significant” progress in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and was working to release new appointments.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on some visa services as we operate with a reduced capacity to observe social distancing. We’ve adapted our working practices in order to clear applications as soon as possible, which includes reusing the fingerprint biometrics of some of our customers to re-enrol and stop people having to attend in person.”UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

CNN said congresswoman Pramila Jayapal cited an anonymous Amazon employee’s testimony that there is a rule against using such data, but that it is not enforced, describing the situation as a “candy shop”.Bezos acknowledged there was a policy that prohibited the use of third-party seller data to support Amazon’s own private-label business. But, he said:\u0026nbsp“I can’t guarantee you that policy has never been violated.” Ms Jayapal, replied: “I’ll take that as you’re not denying it.Now, Apple\u0027s Tim Cool, who like the other witnesses pays tribute to John Lewis, whose memorial service, held up the hearing.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s his comments in fullhttps:docs.house.govmeetingsJUJU0520200729110883HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-CookT-20200729.pdfSundar Pichai, CEO of Google, says its work would not be possible without the long tradition of American innovation, and\u0026nbspwe’re proud to contribute to its future.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She speaks to Oliver Carroll\u0026nbspahead of next week\u0027s electionThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Over the next two weeks, Alexander Lukashenko faces the fight of his life. It was never supposed to be like this – not in Belarus. Not with a self-styled dictator who has previously declared election victories with 75.6 per cent, 82.6 per cent, 79.65 per cent, and 84.14 per cent of the vote. Not with a sophisticated system of modern authoritarianism, one that made independent political activity the preserve of the brave and foolhardy. This time around, the regime did all the things it usually does. Election officials refused to register the three strongest challengers from the field. Out went Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the US, Viktor Babariko, a banker, and Sergei Tikhanovski, advertising entrepreneur and popular political blogger. The latter two were arrested and jailed for their troubles. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBelarus headed for election confrontation as Lukashenko cracks downDespite all that, the 9 August election is gearing up to be the political story of the summer. Battered by criticism over his Covid-19 denialism, the five-term incumbent Lukashenko appears to be in real trouble: regularly upstaged by opposition forces, with unprecedented protests taking place across the country. Even more embarrassing for the macho leader who claims the presidency is “too much for a woman” to handle, his most obvious nemesis is female. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of jailed Sergei Tikhonovsky, was propelled into politics following the arrest of her husband in May. A former translator, secretary and, for the last 10 years, a shy, stay-at-home mum, she tells The Independent she is no politician. She spent much of the last year persuading her “opinionated” husband to do what everyone else in the country did – lie low. She says she anguished as she witnessed surveillance and arrests step up in line with Sergei’s YouTube popularity and informal campaign around the end of last year. But Ms Tikhanovskaya says she knew she had “no right” to stop her husband, and the last time he was arrested, vowed to continue his work. She registered as a candidate. Extraordinarily for a declared opposition candidate in Belarus, she was allowed to run. Defying predictions the opposition would find it difficult to unite, Ms Tikhanovskaya snapped to common language with Maria Kolesnikova, the head of Viktor Barbariko’s presidential campaign, and Veronika Tsepkalo, wife of Valery, the other barred candidate. The basics of an agreement were hammered out in 15 minutes, and a full oral understanding in under a couple of hours. As the registered candidate, Ms Tikhanovskaya would lead the campaign platform. There would be just three pledges: to free political prisoners, reverse authoritarian changes to the constitution made in 1996, and to run new, free elections within six months. The three women announced their decision with a photoshoot: Ms Tikhanovskaya appeared with a clenched fist, flanked by Ms Tsepkalo with a “V” for victory sign and Ms Kolesnikova, with a heart. The symbolism was “spontaneous”, Ms Tikhanovskaya insists, and one of the very few things the group committed to paper. “Don’t think it was some campaign prepared months ago. It was all about the situation we found ourselves in.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The instant agreement. The women leaders. The fact Ms Tikhanovskaya was registered in the first place. Elements of the Belarusian opposition converged with an unusual ally, Mr Lukashenko, in blaming the invisible hand of Moscow – an ungraspable law of nature in these parts. Those who wanted evidence found it easily enough. Viktor Babariko made his money as a manager for a bank owned by Russia’s Gazprom. Valery Tsepkalo retains links with the Belarusian elite – and fled to Russia with his children shortly after his non-registration. Nationalistic opponents of Sergei Tikhanovsky have also criticised his production contracts with Russian stars. Ms Tikhanovskaya rejects the criticism as “silly rumours” that are “impossible to engage with”. She couldn’t speak on behalf of the other campaign teams, but as far as her husband was concerned, she was “more than sure” of his propriety. She saw how he had “looked for kopecks” to pay for petrol while campaigning. If they were Russian agents, they’d have a bit more cash in the bank, she reasoned. Mr Tikhonovski was a leader in protests against closer integration with Russia, and spent 30 days in prison for his trouble: “We know all about Lukashenko’s road maps with Russia, which will slowly but surely lead to full unification. Ask yourself who the pro-Russian candidate really is.”  Ms Tikhanovskaya has grown in self-assurance since the unexpected start to her political career. In conversation with The Independent, she delivers weighted positions that disguise the lack of formal political experience. On Russia, the policy was to be “friends with everyone” – but reduce dependence on oil and gas handouts. On the “painful” subject of Crimea, “de jure” it was Ukrainian, “de facto” Russian, and she wouldn’t drive people further apart by committing to either. She would stay middle of the road on the most controversial social issues like gay marriage: “I’m totally fine with same-sex relations and think any love is wonderful, but perhaps our country isn’t ready for a decision on this just yet.” Ms Tikhanovskaya’s campaign has not shied from taboos. As a registered candidate she was allowed a short broadcast on state TV, and she used it to extraordinary effect. For the first time in many years, viewers were told about political prisoners and arrests. She attacked the president’s Covid-19 denialism and alleged low ratings. Quite how popular the president is is unclear, given that independent polling is illegal in Belarus. One unofficial online poll had him at 3 per cent. That figure is likely to be highly misleading given the president’s historical electoral base. But it has become somewhat of an opposition slogan, and was unwittingly amplified by the president himself when he complained about “3 per cent” Lukashenko jokes. On this, as on much else, the old-fashioned autocrat has found himself behind the curve of modern social media and meme culture. David Marples, a professor at the University of Alberta, Canada, and long time Belarus watcher, suggests that a free vote could be quite evenly split. “Coronavirus and economic problems have conspired to undermine a belief Lukashenko can deliver,” he says. For most of his time in office, the president kept his side of an “unspoken contract” – good pensions and living standards in exchange for political submission. Now, the model is broken. “There is no obvious or honest way for Lukashenko to get the 65 per cent any respectable dictator needs,” Mr Marples says. “It’s the beginning of the end for him – perhaps not in two weeks time, but not far beyond. The fear has gone.” In a sign of increasing nervousness, Belarus’s long time leader has started to to hint at the use of force. On Friday, he said he had “learned the lessons of 2010”, when protests erupted following his claimed overwhelming victory, and were suppressed with the help of riot police. “I understand the need to have well-prepared soldiers ready just in case,” he said. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who has evacuated her children out of Belarus, tells The Independent that there wasn’t a moment where she didn’t feel “very, very frightened”. But it was a fear the whole county shared, she insists. “I hope they will listen to their people – and never, ever send in the tanks or soldiers,” she says. “We don’t want blood, we just want change.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He just sat around drinking beer.#Police are using tools ranging from excavators, shovels and snfer dogs to investigate the plot.It is now the third day of the search in Seelze, near Hannover, believed to be in connection with the  Portugal disappearance of Madeleine McCann.German police officers were seen leaving the digging site with ground radar specialist equipment.Ground-penetrating radar is an instrument used in order to detect electromagnetic contrasts in the soil.It contains antenna to send and detect electromagnetic waves at given frequencies to detect subsurface objects and changes in material properties.When the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials it can be reflected or scattered back to the surface. Police carry a container towards the site where they started digging in an allotment area in Seelze, near Hannover, Germany.Suspect, Christian B, is said to have lived there for a while some years ago.The plot is four miles from Christian Bs last known fixed address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.The suspect is said to have been living at the site in around  or  in a caravan after ing from Portugal, Haz.de reports.An unnamed source told Bild that Christian B had once lived on the site in a caravan for a short while.One neighbour was said to have recognised him from the photo, and recalled seeing his yellow and white VW Camper van, which German police last month appealed for information on.They added Christian B was often seen with the VW at the allotment where he also had two dogs and where he had often rowed with locals.German police searching a garden today on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, are using excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot. Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for. At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported. A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance. Police have just  months to nail the prime suspect in the abduction of Madeleine, according to her family’s lawyer.Rogerio Alves says the clock is ticking on the -year mystery due to a -year time limit on prosecutions in Portugal.He told ITV: “We have a  years time barrier, even to manslaughter, to homicide, to certain sexual offences — and even to the most serious kind of kidnapping.“So we are still on time. But time is getting short now.”Cops are continuing their search of an allotment just four miles from Christian Bs former home in Hanover, Germany.Forensic officers and snfer dogs were seen hunting through the allotment for clues # with an underground tunnel at the centre of the dig.A former friend said Christian B fantasised about creating a Josef Fritzl-style dungeon at his home.Christian B’s pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”The sex offender allegedly revealed his fantasy to a pal while living in the German city of Brunswick after ing to his home country from Portugal.Christian Bs pal # who wanted to remain anonymous # led a TV crew to the house where the twice convicted paedophile was living around .He alleged that the now -year-old German had confided in him that he dreamed of turning the cellar of his rented home into a basement liar.Christian B is said to have wanted to create a dungeon like the one Fritzl built with soundproof walls.There is no evidence to suggest the suspect ever followed through on this idea.Christian Bs pal said: #He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful. Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask. He’s making a point.I was wonderinghe’d like to come and make that point in my town.Because I also think I need to adjust his mask a little.Just want to be helpful.FIRST Dates TV maitre d’ Fred Sirieix is hopelessly in love with his fiancée and has revealed he is having the best sex of his le at . He puts it all down to the fact he has a greater overall wisdom at his age and that he likes himself more than when he was in his twenties.As a mature woman who recently had to kickstart her sex engine after some barren years, I agree there is much truth to feeling a bit wiser with age.Butwe’re really honest, it probably has nothing to do with our maturity and all to do with the connection you make and the person you’re with.It’s nothing you can find on an app, on paper or via social media.It’s just there when you meet. And it takes your breath away.SWEDEN didn’t go into lockdown, preferring instead to keep the economy going with its obedient citizens.The Swedes have been pleased by the way their government have tackled the pandemic, so much so that a solid minority has decided to get tattoos of the chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

German researchers now claim they have trained dogs who can also detect coronavirus from someones saliva. The potentially ground-breaking study was piloted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover, the Hanover Medical School and the German Armed Forces.They found that,properly trained, dogs were able to discriminate between human saliva samples infected with SARS-CoV- and non-infected samples with a whopping success rate of  per cent overall.There is hope that this could help prevent further outbreaks due to the rapid nature of the testing. It could also lead to instant testing at sporting events and airports, allowing countries to scrap some quarantining measures and empty stadium rules.To conduct the study, researchers trained eight dogs from Germanys Armed Forces for one week. The trained canines snfed the saliva of more than , people that were either healthy or infected with the virus. Samples infected with Covid- were distributed at random and neither the animal handlers nor the researchers on site knew which ones were positive.In a Youtube video on the project, Maren von Koeckritz-Blickwede, a professor at the university who conducted the study, says researchers think dogs can do this because the internal processes of an infected person completely change.She said: We think that the dogs are able to detect a specic smell of the metabolic changes that occur in those patients.Ms Von Koeckritz-Blickwede says the next step is to train dogs to dferentiate Covid- samples from other diseases like the flu, while other research will also need to be carried out.

What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people.The Spanish flu pandemic - the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history - emerged in March  with the hallmarks of a seasonal virus.As it coincided with the First World War, the virus spread through army troops from across the globe.  Cases appeared to drop off over the summer - and there was hope at the beginning of August  that the virus had run its course.But from September to November of that year, the death rate skyrocketed and unlike the first wave, this strain affected young, healthy people too.Experts describe it as W curve - where there are high numbers of deaths among the very young and old, as well as a huge spike in the middle, with otherwise healthy  to -year-olds being struck down.The pandemic ended by the summer of , as those had been infected around the world had either died or developed immunity, according to History.In , scientists revealed that they had solved the mystery of how the Spanish started and why it became so deadly.A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people born after  had not been exposed to the kind of virus which devastated the world in .This explains why the deadly pandemic largely targeted young adults while older patients, who had built up some immunity, would often make a full recovery, reports National Geographic.Prof Kirby stressed that people who are overweight may also be at a higher risk of a second wave of coronavirus.He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.Earlier this week, the Government announced its strategy to tackling the obesity crisis in the UK.The new “Better Health” campaign, run by Public Health England, calls on everyone to “embrace a healthier lestyle”.Supported by the NHS, the scheme will allow GPs to refer more patients to the likes of WeightWatchers.GPs will also prescribe exercise, such as cycling and gym classes, and patients will be given access to weight loss apps.Staff in doctors’ surgeries will also be trained as “healthy weight coaches” to give people advice on how to stay trim.Meanwhile, shops will be banned from offering Buy One Get One Free deals on junk food and placing treats near store entrances and tills.Large restaurants, cafes and takeaways must put calorie labels on menus, so customers can make informed choices.And adverts for food high in fat, sugar or salt will be axed from TV and websites before the pm watershed.Ministers will consult on expanding this to cover all times of day and night.Health charities last night welcomed the “world-leading” plans.But critics said it will push up food prices and see cash-strapped families losing out on supermarket bargains.Evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid was a “wake-up call” to ministers.Mr Johnson has lost over a stone by exercising and watching his food since his brush with the virus. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations.They have also searched public gardens opposite a block of flats where he lived.One neighbour said: “There were two police tents on the street and a helicopter flying up above last week. “Police were very busy in the gardens opposite, they seemed to be looking for something. “They wouldn’t say what they were doing but it makes sense now knowing that he lived here and they are searching other sites he was involved with.“Christian is remembered for selling weed when he lived here. The block where he lived always stunk of cannabis, he was the local dealer.”The plot is four miles from his last known address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.He rented a garage at Euro Hobbywerkstatt in Hannover - a few miles down the road from the allotment currently being excavated by German police. He was ­nicknamed “the ­screwdriver” because he always smelled of oil and petrol.Officers from the Met looking for Madeleine took away documents and paperwork relating to the German paedophile. The garage owner said today said detectives “took away everything” to do with Christian B. The suspects former apartment is situated right next to a school - with its playground visible from most windows. Christian B recently abandoned his attempt to secure release from prison and his legal team are said to be battling attempts to pin Madeleines disappearance on him.A run down swimming pool and leisure centre is opposite the high-rise block where he lived from around .Hoffmann said the suspect is unlikely to have provided any information about allotment.“The suspect never confessed to anything. He only ever made confessionsit promised him some benefit orthe evidence was clear anyway, he said.“Repentance or insight - as far as I could see, he never had any.At the latest allotment site being searched this week, trees have been uprooted and a four-foot-deep hole dug at the remote plot.It is coincidentally located just three miles from the grizzly site where a sex worker’s dismembered body was found in .Christian B was questioned over the murder but never charged.The German woman who rented her garden to Christian B in neighbouring Braunschweig told The Mirror in June: “There was a hole in the floor inside the allotment house and one day he told me he wanted to put a see-through perspex glass over it.“I said to him, ‘What the hell for  Just so you can look down into a dirty old cellar ’“In retrospect I think he wanted to build a Fritzl cellar like the guy in Austria who put his daughter down there.”One local said the alleged tunnel cops were digging for could possibly be an old cellar from an outbuilding that once stood there.Officers have been pictured leaving the -ft wide-garden clutching bags of dirt, which will be analysed by forensics teams.They will analyse the soil for any potential DNA evidence that links Madeleine to the site.The searches were carried out in a joint operation by German federal police and the ­prosecutors’ office in ­Braunschweig, where Christian B was convicted of rape last year.The plot being searched - one of five on the site - is commonly known as a ‘laub’ in German.Laubs are commonly included in the sales of city centre flats and apartments.They are garden areas owned by city dwellers to give them refuge from the hustle and bustle of urban le.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meghan also showed her affection while the prince was travelling by wearing a gold chain necklace with the initials M and H - only to be later scolded by the palace. She received a call from from a senior Kensington Palace aide to advise that wearing such a necklace only served to encourage the photographers to keep pursuing such images, and new headlines.The book claims she said little during the call but after hanging up felt frustrated and emotional. The surreal experience of of having someone from her boyfriends office tell her what kind of jewellery to wear or not to smile at a photographer was too much, it adds.

People have been asked to work from home where possible, avoid unnecessary travel, and socially distance. The government also banned gatherings of more than  people, banned visits to nursing home, and closed secondary schools and universities. Primary schools have stayed open, in part to ensure more healthcare workers could continue going to work. At the peak of the outbreak, the country was seeing , cases of coronavirus diagnosed per day, but that figure has now fallen into double digits. There has been speculation that the lighter-touch approach will allow Swedens population to develop herd immunity, but the extent to which recovered coronavirus patients enjoy immunity remains uncertain. Speaking to reporters in Stockholm on Tuesday, Tegnell said: The curves go down, and the curves over the seriously ill begin to be very close to zero. As a whole, it is very positive.He also addressed the question of face masks, which the World Health Organisation continues to recommend people use when social distancing isnt practicable. “With numbers diminishing very quickly in Sweden, we see no point in wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public transport,” he said.Swedens death toll, currently ,, has been high in comparison to neighbouring countries of a similar size. None of Denmark, Norway, or Finland, each with a population roughly half that of Sweden, have seen their tolls rise above ,. Many of the European countries that have begun to reopen their borders to foreign visitors are still yet to allow entry to people travelling from Sweden. The countrys healthcare system also initially struggled to cope with the impact of the virus, with  people at one point being admitted to intensive care every day, though that figure has now fallen to only a handful of people each week. In cases per capita, Sweden now has a similar rate of infection to the UK, and its government has argued that its strategy will be easier to maintain in the long-term. Speaking to Euronews this week, Jan Albert, a professor of infectious disease control at the Karolinska Institute and the author of a recent study on coronavirus in Sweden, said that the issue of herd immunity remained a big unknown. There are so many unknown factors about how many actually develop antibodies and other types of immune responses after going through the disease, and how many will be required to have had the disease in order to see herd immunity, he said. Speaking to Unherd about his countrys response last week, Tegnell said: “It is better to have a more complete discussion around this in say  months, after next summer. Then I think we can more fairly judge what has been good in some countries and bad in other countries.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Spain the number of cases has shot up, forcing the UK to reimpose  daysapos quarantine on anyone who s from there.  Itaposs not quite the same picture in England, where as far as the figures show, thereaposs been no huge rise. But just as pubs, cafes, hairdressers and gyms reopen, there have been worrying local outbreaks in Oldham, Luton, Blackburn, Leicester and more. And across England as a whole, a steady fall in the number of new cases has now levelled off. According to one measure, the number of positive tests each day has risen % since the start of the month.That will worry many people as more rules are lted on August  - with people in England encouraged to go back to work, and the vulnerable no longer needing to shield. So what do the statistics say  We look a few of the figures that will be worrying the PM - and the nation. Boris Johnson said yesterday: Clearly we now face, Iaposm afraid, the threat of a second wave in other parts of Europe and we just have to be vigilant and we have to be very mindful.A Downing Street source later told the Daily Mail : The PM is extremely concerned by what heaposs seeing abroad and fears we could be seeing the same thing here in a fortnight.A No spokesman declined to comment today on the report in the Mail. But askedthere could be a second wave in the UK in two weeks, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast: There is always a risk. We have been clear all along that there is a risk. Hereaposs why they could be worried. . New case numbers are no longer falling in England  The number of new coronavirus cases is no longer falling in England, official figures showed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics announced a steady decline in number of people testing positive for Covid- over recent months has now levelled off.The watchdog estimated that in the week to July , around one in , people in had coronavirus in the community in England. The previous weekaposs bulletin put the figure at one in ,.And there were an estimated , new cases per day, compared with , the previous week.The ONS stopped short of saying cases actually rose - because each weekaposs statistics cannot be directly compared. There are also very high levels of uncertainty, because the ONS is uses a model to estimateallcoronavirus cases in England - not just people who test positive.We explain the separate data on people testing positive below.  The number of people testing positive for Covid- in England has been slowly creeping up for weeks. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in England had fallen to  on July , the lowest since March. But since then the number has gradually ticked up and hit  on July  - a rise of %. The data, issued by Public Health England, could of course be due to more people getting tested for coronavirus - therefore more people testing positive. But whatever the cause, it shows confirmed cases are certainly not levelling off below , and could indicate rises or outbreaks in parts of the nation. The Daily Mail reports there has been an even higher % rise in new cases over a similar period. We used Public Health Englandaposs recommended method to calculate the number of new cases per day - looking at the dates tests were taken, not the date the results came back. But both methods - ours and the Mailaposs - show a steady rise in confirmed cases. For comparison, the rolling average of confirmed cases hit a peak of , on April . . Cases have surged in Oldham - and itaposs only one area where there are problems  Oldham, Greater Manchester, was the latest council yesterday to announce local restrictions after a coronavirus outbreak. It followed Leicester, Luton and Blackburn, all of which have barred residents from exiting lockdown at the same speed as the rest of England. The figures in Oldham show just how quickly the virus can spread. The council saw  cases in the week to  July - up % from  the week before. In Blackburn, the number of new people testing positive per , residents rose from  to  to  over the most recent three weeks. Over the same three-week period in Luton, the number of new positive tests per , residents rose from  to . Spain has been an example to the rest of Europe of how quickly a second wave could descend from where in Europe. The number of Covid- cases in Spain being reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control almost doubled last week. The public health body registered , cases in the week to July  and , in the week to July . While the figures canapost be directly compared to the UKaposs - for example, they record zero Spanish cases on weekends - they were worrying enough for the UK to clamp down with new rules on quarantine. Boris Johnson said: Letaposs be absolutely clear about whataposs happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends.Iaposm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic. Spainaposs PM Pedro Sanchez has insisted the outbreaks are confined to particular regions, claiming most of Spain has case numbers lower than in the UK. .

The Labour leader urged ministers to consider testing people at airports when theyto the UK and then testing them again a few days later.British tourists in Spain faced chaos when the Government abruptly decided to scrap quarantine-free travel with the country at the weekend - forcing people to isolate for  days on ing home. Cabinet Minister Oliver Dowden said there was no viable alternative to the two-week quarantine period for ing tourists, and insisted testing people at airports was not a silver bullet. However Mr Starmer pointed to evidence suggesting the -day isolation period could be reduced with multiple tests. Speaking on a visit to Falmouth, the Labour leader said: Thereaposs some evidence it could be shortened to  or nine days but that depends on really effective testing and that is why we have pushed the Government so hard on testing. Thereaposs the capacity to test, the Government needs to use that to test on arrival and then after a short interval becausethat period of  days can be brought down to eight, nine or  then obviously thereaposs a huge benefit in that. Mr Starmer said Labour supported the need for quarantine measures but he added: Itaposs really unfortunate for those in other countries and I really feel for them but it is necessary that we take all preventative measures to prevent a second spike.  Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye pleaded with the Government to allow tests to ease restrictions - and said the airport would be ready to go in two weeks.

It comes after warnings more towns could follow the East Midlands city of Leicester into a local lockdown. Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire and Luton in Bedfordshire were both on high alert due to local infection rates. In the former, the number of guests allowed to visit another household is limited to just two.  The council has also instructed residents to wear masks in enclosed public spaces, such as shops and beauty salons.

And after just a few weeks of residents enjoying visitors to their home and apossocial bubblesapos, they have now been banned.The boroughaposs , residents must also keep two metres apart from friends and family when seeing them outside, the Manchester Evening News reports.From Friday, vulnerable and elderly people who have been shielding are now being asked to continue to do so for another two weeks. Ed and Ann Jones, from Lees, said that people in Oldham should have followed the rules to begin with. I thought itaposd be over by now, Ed sighed, If people had obeyed the rules to begin with, weaposd be all right now. People havenapost been doing it, -year-old Ann said.  Like with the raves that theyaposve had. I donapost think the younger ones understand how itaposs actually affecting people. I didnapost go in a supermarket from March for three months. The only people Iaposve had round is my son and my daughter. The couple questioned why the council couldnapost impose the measures on specic parts of Oldham, rather than the entire town. It would make sense to lockdown the area where these cases are rising, Oldham is a big place, Ann added. That way youaposd know who is breaking the rules.  Oldham Council said a signicant proportion of recent cases involve multiple people testing positive in a single household. Town hall chiefs said that shows household spread is a real issue - especially in cases in which large families live together in one home. If youaposve got a big family and youaposre all under one roof itaposs really hard not to mingle with other people, Ed added. The tougher guidelines are aimed at avoiding a full government-mandated local lockdown like the one that has taken place in Leicester.  In the seven days to July  there have been  new cases of the virus in Oldham. This is more than a fourfold increase from the previous week, ending July , which saw  positive cases. Just four days ago, the government had dropped the borough from its watch list of areas of concern due to a fall in the infection rate. As part of the guidelines, people are being urged to wear a mask when they cannot guarantee being able to stay two metres apart, such as in shops and on public transport.  But local business owner Pauline Jackson, who runs a shop which specialises in shoe repairs and key cutting, said masks should have been compulsory from day one. I think people would rather stay at home now than wear a mask, she said. I think from day one when shops were allowed to open that masks should have been compulsory to everybody. I think wearing the masks should have come out right at the beginning.  The -year-old from Chadderton said the lockdown has had a huge impact on her business. Weaposre not on our own, everybody is exactly the same. It hasnapost picked up, she said. We do rely on the elderly age group and theyaposre not coming out. With the elderly and vulnerable having to stay in again for two weeks that will massively impact the business.  I think itaposs going to have a very big impact on us all. Barbara Davidson has been visiting her daughter Angela and grandchildren since the lockdown measures were eased earlier this month. Shopping in the town centre with her daughter she asked: So are we doing something illegal now by being together  Itaposs a big change for peopleall of a suddengoes back to a lockdown, she added.  June Brooks from Hathershaw has been visiting her son every Tuesday. The -year-old said sheaposs not surprised the cases are rising. But Marie, a carer from Springhead, said she was shocked to hear about the new, tougher restrictions. I havenapost really noticed anyone not following the rules, but town today seems quite busy really, she said.  It is a worry when the cases are rising quite signicantly. Iqbal, a taxi driver in Oldham, said the tougher restrictions will impact his familyaposs Eid celebrations on Friday. Itaposs like our Christmas, he said. Weaposve just been getting things back to normal.  The mosques have opened up again and people are coming and going, so it will be back to square one again. Youaposve just got to be careful, check your temperatures, make sure nobody has been in contact with anyone and just be careful. It will affect Eid because itaposs a big gathering so I donapost know how itaposs going to work out. All the family usually gets together. Deputy council leader and cabinet member for COVID- recovery Arooj Shahsaid the best way to avoid infection is limiting contact with others and staying home wherever you can, including working from home where possible.  She urged people to meet in groups of no more than six people from dferent households when outside, and said gatherings larger than six should only take placeeveryone is exclusively from two households or support bubbles. It is against the law for gatherings of more than  people to take place in private homes, including gardens and other outdoor spaces, and for a range of other events, including weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and services, community activities and support groups the government advice is the same, Cllr Shah added. Earlier this month, it was announced that the borough had been chosen as one of four pilot sites in the country testing people who do not have symptoms of coronavirus. Katrina Stephens, director of public health for Oldham, urged anyone with symptoms to book a coronavirus test online.

Meghan is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedafter it published parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas in August . The case continued today as her legal team bid to keep the identities of friends, who gave an interview to People magazine in February last year, secret in reports of the proceedings. In the People article, the friends spoke out against the bullying Meghan said she has faced, and have only been identied in confidential court documents. The duchess, , says her friends gave the interview without her knowledge, and denies a claim made by ANL that she caused or permitted the People article to be published.  In court documents for the hearing, before Mr Justice Warby, Meghanaposs lawyers argued that the friends - referred to as A to E - have a right to anonymity both as confidential journalistic sources and under their own privacy rights. Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing the duchess, said in written submissions to the court: To force the claimant, as the defendant urges this court to do, to disclose their identities to the public at this stage would be to exact an unacceptably high price for pursuing her claim for invasion of privacy against the defendant in respect of its disclosure of the letter. On her case, which will be tried in due course, the defendant has been guilty of a flagrant and unjustied intrusion into her private and family le. Given the close factual nexus between the letter and the events leading up to the defendantaposs decision to publish its contents, it would be a cruel irony were she required to pay that price before her claim has even been determined.  Mr Rushbrooke added: The friends are not parties to this action, but unwilling participants. At this early stage of the litigation it cannot be said with certainty that they would be witnesses at the trial. He told the court that ANLaposs case is that Meghan had compromised her friendsapos right to privacy by putting their names into a public court document. He said: We say, on any analysis, that is actually a grotesque perversion of whataposs actually happened. Mr Rushbrooke added: It is bad enough that the position was taken in correspondence, but it is disappointing to see it persisted with in written submissionsput before the court. The true position is, let there be no doubt about it, that the claimant has done nothing of the sort. It was the defendant who made the interviews with People relevant.  It was the defendant who forced the claimant to identy the names of the five friends in a court document by serving a request for further information that required those names to be given and, for her part, we submit that the claimant has done what she reasonably and sensibly could to protect their confidentiality and privacy rights. Meghanaposs lawyers also argue that Associated Newspapers has already demonstrated a willingness to publish articles based on the contents of court documents. Mr Rushbrooke added: There can be little doubt that, in addition to defending this case through the courts, the defendant is seeking to maximise the publicity surrounding this case, which it has repeatedly dubbed aposthe trial of the centuryapos. ANLaposs lawyers are resisting the application to keep the identities of Meghanaposs friends secret, claiming the duchessaposs friends brought the letter into the public domain when it was referred to for the first time in the People interview. In written submissions, Anthony White QC, acting for ANL, said: The friends are important potential witnesses on a key issue. Reporting these matters without referring to names would be a heavy curtailment of the mediaaposs and the defendantaposs entitlement to report this case and the publicaposs right to know about it.  No friendaposs oral evidence could be fully and properly reported because full reporting might identy her, especially as there has already been media speculation as to their identities. Mr White also said the present order sought by the duchessaposs lawyers would leave Meghan entitled to disclose the identities to anyone - including the media - who could publish it, while ANLaposs titles would remain barred from doing so. In a witness statement submitted as part of the application, Meghan said: Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, is threatening to publish the names of five women - five private citizens - who made a choice on their own to speak anonymously with a US media outlet more than a year ago, to defend me from the bullying behaviour of Britainaposs tabloid media. These five women are not on trial, and nor am I. The publisher of the Mail on Sunday is the one on trial.  It is this publisher that acted unlawfully and is attempting to evade accountability, to create a circus and distract from the point of this case - that the Mail on Sunday unlawfully published my private letter. Each of these women is a private citizen, young mother, and each has a basic right to privacy. Meghan is suing ANL over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline, which were published in February  and reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father in August . The headline on the article read: Revealed: The letter showing true tragedy of Meghanaposs rt with a father she says has aposbroken her heart into a million piecesapos. The duchess - who announced the launch of the legal action in October last year - is seeking damages from ANL, the newspaperaposs publisher and operator of the website, for alleged misuse of private information,infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. ANL wholly denies the allegations, particularly the duchessaposs claim that the letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning, and says it will hotly contest the case.

Phoebe fell while visiting the Ceunant Mawr Waterfall in Llanberis on the edge of popular tourist destination Snowdonia. The six-year-old was pulled over the edge of the waterfall and down into the pool below, where thankfully a stranger managed to save her.She was left with just minor bruising and a scrape, the BBC reported.Phoebeaposs motheraposs partner Liam Bolland jumped into the water to try to save her before she was sucked away by the current. He was taking photos from the waterfallaposs viewing area when he heard a aposhorrible, horrible screamapos from his partner.  Liam spun round to see a look of terror on his partneraposs face, who then told him Phoebe was in the water.  Despite not being able to see her beneath the bubbling water he launched himself into the pool, only to be hit by its breathtaking coldness. Liam explained how he struggled to reach her while keeping himself above the water, before hearing Phoebe tumble over the edge. I could hear the screaming from my partner and son and the water bashing down next to me, he told The BBC.  Liam managed to pull himself up out of the water using some roots. While he did, other family members began shouting down to people by the lower pool where the water lands. One man managed to throw himself into the water and pull the young girl out.  While she was in a state of shock she was mercully unharmed. She is an amazing little girl, Liam said. She has a couple of small bruises and a bit of a scrape on her arm. Phoebe was taken by ambulance to Bangoraposs Ysbyty Gwynedd to be checked over. Liam thanked and hugged the man who saved her. In the days since the accident the family have revisited the waterfall to try and work out what happened.  It is unclear how Phoebe, who was standing a couple of feet from her mum, tumbled into the water. Liam has called for the area to be assessed for safety. Gwynedd council said warning signs were already in place. A member of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team was near the waterfall when the incident unfolded.

The -year-old motorcyclist was killed in a road crash in August last year, and has since been the subject of an international row. His mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn said they had decided to scatter his ashes in Weymouth, Dorset, where the Dunns took their annual family holidays. The teen was last in his favourite town in July  and Mrs Charles described today as the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives. Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn, alongside their partners Bruce and Tracey and other extended family members, travelled down to say goodbye to Harry.Mrs Charles said that although it will feel like they are setting him free, the fighting will continue to get US suspect Anne Sacoolas back to the UK. Askedher sonaposs funeral provided any closure, Mrs Charles said: No, and we were really numb back then - very much a bunch of zombies, to put it mildly. We donapost remember a lot about the first few weeks at all. Obviously weaposve been through so much since then - weaposve been to hell and back on many, many occasions. Weaposre not numb any more, we just hurt all day every day. The hurt is there constantly and it never, ever goes away. But now,  months on, today is going to be the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives, and I canapost imagine it getting any harder. You shouldnapost have to scatter your own childaposs ashes. Mr Dunn said he hoped the family could have peace after scattering the ashes. Asked why they picked Weymouth, he said: From a very early age, Tracey and I first came with Harry and Niall to Weymouth on our first family holiday back in , and every year we would come back on the same week. It became a tradition, and as we know poor Harry died last year and today is exactly the last day he was here - he came for a night with his friends... so itaposs a year to the day since he was last in Weymouth and weaposre here to scatter his ashes and let him ride free.Mrs Charles added: We can rest assured that heaposs definitely out there riding the skies and going everywhere that he wants to go. Weaposve found a beautul spot where we are going to take him and weaposre sure that the wind will carry his ashes and the waves will be splashing up on the rocks to help him travel too. So weaposll feel like weaposve set him free. Commenting on what is next for the family, Mrs Charles said: Proper closure. Which is to make sure that Anne Sacoolas goes through the UK justice system. That has to happen. You and I would have had to have done it - in my view she is no dferent. So we will keep fighting - today is going to be extremely tough, but the determination never wavers, ever. It doesnapost matter what today takes out of us, tomorrow will be yet another day of fighting. Today is just for us but the fighting will continue.

Michael Seed, , known as Basil the Ghost, was living on an average of less than £, a year before the  heist, a court has heard. The frugal alarm specialist was arrested in , two years after the rest of the gang were jailed, and got  years for his part in the , £.million burglary. Prosecutor Philip Evans QC told the confiscation hearing that the court has to decideSeed had a criminal lestyle, what the benefit was and whether he gained from it. Mr Evans told Woolwich Crown Court: There is simply no supporting evidence of the defendantaposs assertion that he was running a jewellery business. Richard Sutton QC, defending, said his client had been living on around the same amount as the state pension. He said: “It does not suggest that this is a man living on the proceeds of crime. This is small beer indeed.” Seed was one of two raiders who climbed into the vault to loot  safe deposit boxes after the ageing criminals had bored through the thick concrete using a diamond-tipped drill. He is the son of a DNA pioneer who inherited his fatheraposs brilliant mind, but used his talents to further a career in crime. Seed evaded capture for three years before police raided his flat in Islington, north London - around two miles from Hatton Garden - in March . He denied any involvement in the heist, but was found guilty of conspiring to burgle, handle stolen goods and convert or transfer criminal property.  Judge Christopher Kinch QC, during the March  sentencing, told Seed: Your role was a central one. You were at the heart of the core activities that had to be carried out. You were not just there to fetch and carry. In my judgment this must rank among the worst offences of its type. Seedaposs fellow Hatton Garden ringleaders Brian Reader, , John Kenny Collins, , Daniel Jones, , and Terry Perkins, who died in prison last year aged , were all jailed in .

Christian Brueckner lived off-grid at the vegetable garden near Hanover, Germany in , locals have claimed. The convicted sex offender reportedly had no interest in growing vegetables but lounged around drinking beer and told people he was a car mechanic while living in a van. The gazebo has since been destroyed but German media reports today that police digging up the site have found the cellar and are searching it for evidence about Madeleineaposs disappearance. Wolfgang Kossak, who lives in a neighbouring property, said the search was “ominous”.  He said many of the plots were sub-let and he recalled a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around  and . According to local newspaper HAZ, detectives discovered and searched the cellar of a gazebo which had once stood at the garden. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Kossak said: Christian Brueckner had the garden next to mine. He arrived in  and left within a year. He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there. The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations.He said the buildings on Brueckneraposs plot of land were demolished in . He added that Brueckner would talk of his preference for southern Europe due to the climate and that the rapist had a VW Transporter van and parked it next to the allotment and lived in the vehicle. Police have said a camper van that was spotted in the Praia da Luz area in early  is vital to their investigation. Mobile phone records proved Brueckner was in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared.  German detectives have not saidthey are looking for Madeleineaposs remains or simply evidence against Brueckner. German prosecutors have said they believe the missing youngster, who vanished from her Portuguese hotel room in , is dead. Police in Portugal have also renewed search efforts based on reports that the German suspect stayed in the area in a beat-up RV at the time Madeleine went missing. They have unsuccessfully searched around  wells for human remains. Mr Kossak said that Brueckner disappeared in  and he never saw him again.  German media says he received at least two criminal convictions from a Hanover court, one for forging documents in  and another for theft in .    He split his time between Germany and Portugal from  to , prosecutors in Hanover have said. Asked by Bild about Brueckneraposs connection to the allotment, the suspectaposs lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said he could not comment on the police operation.   Pressed on why the allotment was being searched, Fuelscher told the newspaper that I think weaposll find out the reason soon.

The Department for Transport has launched a consultation which could see changes in the driveraposs rule book including making it clear where cyclists and pedestrians have priority or aposright of wayapos over drivers. The plan is trying to improve safety for pedestrians - in particular for children, older adults and disabled people. There would be new rules around what to do when you see someone waiting to cross the road as well as how drivers should deal with cyclists at junctions. Cyclists will be given clearer priority at junctions, and pedestrians clearer priority when crossing or waiting to cross the road. There would also be mention of the Dutch Reach - a method for opening your car door without endangering cyclists - as well as making sure warning sounds are working on electric cars and making sure your charging cable is not a trip hazard.  The main alterations to the code being proposed, as reported by Cornwall Live, are: Introducing a hierarchy of road users which ensures that those road users who can do the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the danger or threat they may pose to others Clarying existing rules on pedestrian priority on pavements, to advise that drivers and riders should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross the road Providing guidance on cyclist priority at junctions to advise drivers to give priority to cyclists at junctions when travelling straight ahead Establishing guidance on safe passing distances and speeds when overtaking cyclists and horse riders. The plan reads: The consultation document is seeking views on proposed changes to The Highway Code to improve safety for pedestrians, particularly children, older adults and disabled people, cyclists and horse riders. It is important that these groups feel safe in their interactions with other road users. The document says it gives: specic consideration on overtaking, passing distances, cyclist and pedestrian priority at junctions, opening vehicle doors and responsibility of road users. The changes would be made to a number of sections of the Highway Code including:Rules for pedestriansRules about animalsRules for cyclistsRules for drivers and motorcyclistsGeneral rules, techniques and advice for all drivers and ridersUsing the roadRoad users requiring extra careWaiting and parkingAnnex : you and your bicycle Annex : vehicle maintenance, safety and security. Discussing the planned new Hierarchy of Road Users the plan reads: The ‘Hierarchy of Road Users’ is a concept which places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. The road users most likely to be injured in the event of a collision are pedestrians, in particular children, older adults and disabled people, followed by cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists. The hierarchy does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly. The following H rules clary this concept. It is important that ALL road users are aware of The Highway Code, are considerate to other road users and understand their responsibility for the safety of others. It adds: Those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, followed by vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles. Cyclists, horse riders and horse drawn vehicles likewise have a responsibility to reduce danger to pedestrians. Always remember that the people you encounter may have impaired sight, hearing or mobility, and may not be able to see or hear you. None of this detracts from the responsibility of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders, to have regard for their own and other road users’ safety.  There would be new rules around what to do when you see someone waiting to cross the road. They would read: At a junction you should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross a road into which or from which you are turning. You MUST give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists on a parallel crossing. You should give way to pedestrians waiting to cross a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists waiting to cross a parallel crossing. Horse riders and horse drawn vehicles should also give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and pedestrians and cyclists on a parallel crossing. Pedestrians have priority when on a zebra crossing, on a parallel crossing or at light controlled crossings when they have a green signal. Cyclists should give way to pedestrians on shared use cycle tracks. Only pedestrians may use the pavement. This includes people using wheelchairs and mobility scooters.

They claim that Meghan was upset by the call, saying that she said very little while on the phone, instead choosing instead to simply listen to the counsel. They write: But after hanging up, she felt frustrated and emotional. While she knew the aide had good intentions, the surreal experience of having someone from her boyfriendaposs office tell her what kind of jewelry to wear or not to smile at a photographer was too much.  They said she felt distraught, and damnedshe did, and damnedshe didnapost. Meghan reportedly discussed the incident with a friend, saying: I canapost win. They make out like Iaposm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like Iaposm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I donapost know what to say. It was only yesterday that people online were saying I look miserable in pictures, because I was trying to just ignore the [photographer]. The necklace is the latest in a number of claims to emerge from the book, which will be released next month. It discusses a reported fallout between Harry and William, saying the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Harry was offended by Williamaposs unwanted advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, it is alleged. It also claims that things were tough between Kate and Meghan, saying the strain was evident at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day last year. “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word,” write the authors. Tensions peaked at their final joint engagement, the Commonwealth service at Westminster, in March. It’s claimed: “although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her”. The book also features details of the coupleaposs first date and the night news of their relationship was leaked. They write: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours.

Naomi Hubbard, , was forced to give birth to baby son George as husband Jack, also , rushed them to hospital in their Mazda CX on July . The couple had been sent home by Peterborough City Hospital, where Naomi works, just hours earlier after staff told them their fourth child wasn’t ready to be born. But Naomi’s waters broke almost as soon as they ed back home to Stamford, Lincs., and they rushed straight back out at am. Jack hit speeds of more than mph along a dual carriageway and ran through red lights as he made the  mile journey back to the hospital. As they were four minutes away from AE, Naomi called over to her husband from the front seat to tell him: “The baby’s head is coming out.” Naomi, who said she used tips picked up from watching One Born Every Minute, managed to deliver little George there and then as they sped along the A. She even calmly untangled the umbilical cord which got wrapped around his neck. The pair then continued on their journey to the hospital where medics took over and checked over healthy George, who was born weighing lbs oz. The couple believe Naomi’s love of the Channel  documentary series One Born Every Minute helped during the impromptu front seat delivery. Mum Naomi, an orthopaedic nurse, said: “I do like One Born Every Minute and watched it a lot. I’m quite a big fan “I felt him coming and grabbed his head and then his body like I had seen midwives grab them on the show. “It is quite embarrassing in a way because I’m a nurse, but I don’t deal with babies in my profession because I’m not a midwe. “But my training must have helped in some sort of way, because as a nurse it’s important to keep calm in highly stressful intense moments. “One Born Every Minute may have helped but you just act on instinct in moments like those because it all happened so fast. “I hadn’t had a natural birth before and wasn’t expecting there to be so little time between my waters breaking and the baby coming out. “We left home at about am and George was born at .am. “Once I’d untangled the umbilical cord and heard him cry that was an immense relief. “That is the first thing you listen for when you give birth to know the baby’s alright. “He’s settling in at home really well. His brother and sisters Poppy, Harry and Millie are besotted with him and want to cuddle him all the time. “It’s a good story to tell him when he grows up - the rest of my family didn’t quite believe it. They were shell shocked by it.” Jack, a tennis coach, said hospital staff didn’t believe him at first when he arrived at AE to tell them his we was in the car with their newborn baby. He added that he hadn’t received any penalty points yet for speeding or running through red lights - but was keeping George’s birth certicate ready just in case. He said: “I was rushing to get her to the hospital and as I was driving along she said ‘the baby’s head is coming out’. The next thing I knew, I heard a baby cry. “I was driving as fast as I could. I put my foot down to the floor. I didn’t dare look across at Naomi in the front seat. “I kept going as fast as I could and phoned the ambulance to say we are very close to the hospital and need some assistance when we get there. “It was probably a pretty lively speed, but it was a smooth, straight road and we weren’t bumping around. “When it happened we were going quite fast, at least mph. There can’t be too many babies who have been born at mph. “At one point I went through a red light and the driver started beeping me. I thought ‘you don’t know what’s happening in here mate’. “I haven’t received any penalty points yet, butI do I’ll send a letter showing George’s birth certicate so they know my we was having a baby in the car. Around  doctors and paramedics rushed out of AE to help when they arrived. “My we was in the front seat and the seatbelt had tangled with the umbilical cord, so one of the medical staff had to cut through the belt. I’ll have to get a new one,” said Jack. “It was our fourth child and the other four have been more strenuous in terms of birth. “In a way, it was probably the easiest out of the four. George didn’t fall on the floor of the car and there were no complications in the birth. “The medical staff were all shocked. “People were saying how calm I was, but she was so calm she casually untangled the seat belt and umbilical cord. “I just had to keep my foot down and go through a couple of red lights to get to the hospital as fast as I could.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new healthy london tube map","story":"NewsNew healthy London Tube map shows how long it takes to walk or cycle between stationsThe aim of the the Healthy London Transport Map is to get people exercising more and relying on public transport lessShareCommentsByAdrian Hearn:,  JUL NewsThe map shows you healthier ways to get about \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Online sports retailer Decathlon created a unique take on the iconic London Underground map, which looks at the benefits of walking, running, cycling and scootering, instead of using public transport. The Healthy London Transport Map tells you how long it will take to get one from station to the other compared to travelling on the tube.It also tells you how many calories you would burn, the amount of CO you will save and how much it would have cost to have taken the train. For example, taking the tube from Paddington to Oxford Circus would typically take around eight minutes and cost £.. But on a bike, it would take  minutes, burn  calories and save g of CO. Getting from Wimbledon to Westminster takes around  minutes on the tube but on a bike it would take approximately  minutes, burn  calories and save g of CO. The map was designed by Decathlon after a study revealed  per cent of workers are worried about ing to the workplace during the pandemic, with the idea of using public transport again a big concern. As a result,  per cent of Brits are going to avoid getting on a bus, train or taxi. The survey of , adults also found that  per cent did more exercise during lockdown than before. Walkingwas the most popular way to keep fit, while  per cent worked out while gardening,  per cent did floor exercises,  per cent went running and  per cent got out on their bicycle. Just over one in took part in online and on-demand fitness shows while  per cent did yoga and weight training to keep in shape.  More than halfof the adults, polled for Decathlon by OnePoll, are going to maintain their fitness regime when normality resumes. And  per cent want the government and local authorities to do more to encourage people to walk, run, scooter and cycle to work. Eric Mazillier, cycle-commuter and CEO of Decathlon UK, said: We created the Healthy Transport Map for London to encourage those living and commuting in and around the city to find healthier, safer and more sustainable ways to get around. Our goal for the creation of this free, easy-to-use tool, is to be used as a helping hand for people, their families and communities to achieve any ambitions to become happier, healthier - whether physically or financially - or to reduce the impact of their travel-habits on our environment. We hope this small but important development will be the little push that many people want and need, to find accessible and alternative ways to be where they need to be, without using those emission-heavy forms of transport.

Lissie Harper had been married to PC Harper for just a month when he was killed by Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , as they tried to steal a quad bike. PC Harper, , was dragged for more than a mile along the country lanes of Berkshire when he became entangled in a tow rope attached to the teenagersapos getaway car. An Old Bailey jury acquitted all three defendants of murder on Friday, instead convicting Cole and Bowers of manslaughter. Long had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.In an open letter posted on her Facebook page on Tuesday evening, Mrs Harper wrote to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Lord Blunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country. She wrote: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be. The original trial was abandoned on the day the country went into lockdown in March, while for the retrial Mr Justice Edis ordered extra security measures amid fears of potential juror intimidation.  A female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining  started deliberating on their verdicts after she was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the teenagers in the dock. The defendants hugged each other after the verdicts were ed following more than  hours of deliberations. Speaking outside court, Mrs Harper thanked the police and prosecution who had stood in our corner and fought to make sure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes. But she criticised the verdicts in the open letter on Facebook, which has been shared more than , times.

Full-time mum Laura Tucker, , had applied  nails, fastened the top on the glue pot and put it on a shelf before she went to take the bins out. Primark say the glue complies fully with EU standards for safety, quality and product labelling. But -month-old Santi Haines managed to reach the bottle from his highchair and removed the lid. He then got out of the highchair and onto the settee before pouring the contents over himself when his grandfather turned his back for a second. Laura and her dad Peter rushed Santi to the sink to wash the glue off, but were horried to find it had spilled on his arm and reacted with his pyjama top, causing a large burn. Santi was taken to hospital with third-degree burns so severe he had to have a graft operation - with surgeons removing skin from his bottom and transferring it to his left arm. Distraught Laura claims shocked nurses told her the ingredients in the nail glue were the same as the hospitalaposs surgical glue. Santi could be scarred for le and medics have warned it might take two years for him to recover fully.  Laura, from Reading, said: The worst I thought it would probably do is stick fingers together. Santi cried but didnapost scream - the deeper the burn, the less it hurts, - but he was very distressed in the hospital. I was upset at first but now Iaposm more angry. Iaposve found out it has happened to other people, and Primark hasnapost done anything about it. Primark have told people they were going to investigate the product, but they obviously havenapost. Laura had bought the £. Primark aposPS Brush On Nail Glueapos, which has a sticker on it warning of potential skin aposbondingapos, to apply her own  nails. But while she was in the garden with the bins, her dad Peter popped into the kitchen for a matter of seconds and ed to find Santi on the sofa playing with the open bottle.  Laura noticed her toddler son was scratching his arm and removed his top to find burns just below his elbow. The little amount Santi had spilled onto the sofa was also starting to smoke. Nurses at Royal Berkshire Hospitalaposs AE department were astonished by Santiaposs injuries and couldnapost wash out all of the glue, even after two attempts. Santi was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospitalaposs specialist burns unit in Aylesbury, Bucks., where he underwent a skin graft operation. Laura was unable to be with her son when he was being put under anaesthetic or when he came round later due to social distancing measures. She said: We were worried because babies put everything in their mouths!  I have no problems with how we were treated in hospital, but it did make it lots harder. Fortunately, Santi was allowed tohome immediately after the procedure. Laura informed Primark but is yet to hear back from the company. She also posted about her experience on social media, and was appalled when she received numerous messages from people who had also been burned by the product. Laura discovered that some of the people who had also complained to the brand had only received a £ voucher in compensation. A Primark spokesperson said: We were very sorry to learn of this customeraposs experience and we are in touch with her to investigate her complaint.

The victim, -year-old Victor King, was a professional bridge player and described as one of the good guys — one that would never hurt a soul. The former IT worker for Travelers insurance had recently taken Thompson in as a tenant for his spare bedroom. An arrest warrant states Thompson had threatened his landlord with the huge sword in a row about him not paying the rent. Mr King had reported this to the police a day before he was decapitated, on Sunday. He claimed Thompson waved the blade at him. The victimaposs friends alerted police when they could not get hold of him on Sunday, before officers along with firefighters forced their way into Mr Kingaposs home and found a gruesome scene. When Thompson was pulled over in his car in the city after a manhunt, he refused to speak. The arrest warrant states he scribbled on a piece of paper the words - paper in glove compart in Jeep is all you need. This is when police found the paperwork. Thompson, who has previous convictions for robbery and assault, has remained silent. Thompson, who has previous convictions for assault and robbery, was arraigned Tuesday in Superior Court,  and was held on  million bail.

Disturbing footage shows the man stood up while repeatedly hitting the young boy on the bottom as heaposs sat on a chair. The man then sits the boy upright, before confronting the girl who is also sat on a chair next to him. He tells her to Sit your a** down while pointing right in her face. It is not known how the man knows the two children. The video, which has been shared thousands of times on social media left  parents shocked at the harshness of the punishment. One person tweeted: This is gross and anyone condoning it is disgusting as well. If you have to hit your kids to make them listen, you’re the problem. Another condemned the behaviour. They tweeted: Yes, it’s wrong. Hitting solves nothing. It makes you fear the hell out of someone. That kind of fear isn’t parenting. Just because your parents did this to you, doesn’t make it right. There are better ways to communicate than putting hands on someone, especially a child.  That is far too much, another wrote. Kids are learning and growing still. Theyaposre not full adults who understand everything. This kind of hitting is abuse. Wrong, another commented. If you have to resort to hitting a child then you’ve lost control. It’s no longer a teachable moment. I’m okay with spanking but this was VERY hard and too many times.  But disturbingly many didnapost see an issue with the punishment. One person tweeted: Right. His job is not to be their friend. Its to prepare them for the real world so they can navigate it without his protection. Pain teaches you what NOT to do, another said, while the video has even caught the attention of sport stars.

For years, Japanaposs north coast had been the site of the disturbing phenomenon, with rickety fishing vessels arriving more than ,km from where they set out. In  the numbers were unprecedented with more than  damaged boats landing, containing a total of  bodies, compared to  vessels the year before. Some have speculated the weather that year was to blame and that North Koreaaposs aging fishing population had something to do with the problem. But a study by non-profit Global Fishing Watch and published today in journal Science Advances has been able to shed some light on the matter. Researchers used satellite technologies to analyse marine traffic in northeast Asia in  and , and discovered hundreds of dark fishing fleets - believed to be Chinese - have been operating in North Korean waters - apparently illegally. This meant ushering out North Korean boats and forcing them on ill-advised ventures into Russian and Japanese waters, poorly equipped for long distance travel.For foreigners, fishing in waters off the North Korean coast or trading fish caught there internationally is against the law - but it doesnapost appear to have deterred the huge swathes of rogue ships, according to the report. The paperaposs authors estimate in  and  alone these ships caught more than , metric tons of Pacic flying squid, a particularly valuable seafood - worth £ million. Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study, said: It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nationaposs waters. Another author, Jungsam Lee, said the North Korean vesselsapos decision to try their luck in distant foreign waters would have proved catastrophic for many of the fisherman.  It is too dangerous for them to work in the same waters as the Chinese trawlers, he explained. Thataposs why theyaposre pushed to work in Russian and Japanese waters and that explains why some of North Koreaaposs damaged vessels showed up on the beaches of Japan. Northeast Asiaaposs waters are some of the most contested seas in the world, but fish stocks are in dramatic decline. The Pacic flying squid stocks have dropped  per cent in South Korean waters and  per cent Japanese waters since , according to Global Fishing Watch.

We expect that there will be strong legacy from our partnership approach with our private, voluntary and independentproviders that will continue to change the way we perceive ELC.”Zoe Williamson, manager of VIP Childcare in Elgin, said of the funding: “This funding has come at a welcome time for our nursery and others like us. While we already incorporated outdoor learning as standard this will enable us to invest in outdoor play equipment and expand our outdoor provision to allow more time outside.”Leann Cairns, a childminder in Lossiemouth, said: “We know the benefits to children of being outdoors, both in their health and learning, so this funding will enable me to develop more activities to enhance the time spent outside.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Im a good test subject given Ive never met a midge that doesnt like me.I still bear the scars ndash mental and physical ndash of a long weekend in Glen Coe a few years ago. It was July. There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow. Im considering putting up bat boxes after reading that a lone bat can eat , midges in one night.Citronella and Saltidinare among the ingredients that midges are said to find repugnant and give a wide berth. Essential oils such as eucalyptus, lavender and lemongrass have been credited with similar properties .The midge has a mighty reputation for such a miniscule insect. Weighing just one th of a gram, it has a teeny wingspan of -mm. Midges breed in vast numbers across  per cent of Scotlands land mass.Midges are said to enjoy the smell of our natural body odour and sweat which is where using certain scents can come in handy.Here we test some of the best midge-repelling lotions and potions:Avon Skin So Soft , pound.This moisturiser wasnt designed with midges in mind but has famously been adopted for that purpose. When I interviewed the ultramarathon runner Dean Karnazes in , he mentioned that a friend had advised stocking up on Avon Skin So Soft would be prudent before a visit to Scotland.The Royal Marines are said to swear by its midge-repelling powers when training or based in and around the west coast.The secret to Skin So Soft creating a no-fly zone for midges has been widely attributed to the citronella that it contains.Skin So Soft has been my go-to over the years, clocking up a decent midge-busting hit rate.Application consistency:A dry oil spray.Smell:Baby talcum powder.Verdict:Still a classic. It has won an army of global fans for good reason.Visit avon.ukSmidge , pound.Wandering around shops and supermarkets across the Highlands during the summer months, you will see tourists clutching this elixir.Smidge has been about for a decade now. Its development was led by Dundee-based Dr Alison Blackwell, an authority on midge behaviour and leader of the team behind the Scottish Midge Forecast.The active ingredient is Saltidin which, according to the blurb, \"has been molecularly designed to effectively block the antennal receptors of biting insects ndash basically, it throws them off your scent.\" Smidge is also billed as working on mosquitoes, black flies, sand flies, fleas and ticks.Application consistency:A lightweight, aluminium cannister with pump spray that dispels a fast-absorbing, water-based lotion.Smell:Chic unisex scent. Think CK One.Verdict:Did a stellar job as I sat in my tree-covered garden on a still, humid evening.Visit smidgeupMary Jean Highland Midge Lotion , poundThe idea of making a midge lotion is one that Elizabeth and Mary Quinn struck upon by chance. The owners of family-run Mary Jean in Fochabers, Moray, were selling their skincare products at a Highland Games in .The midges were biting and in a moment of inspiration, Mary soaked some kitchen roll in lemongrass oil and hung it from their stall. It worked a treat and an idea took seed, leading to the creation of Mary Jean Highland Midge Lotion.,params: .pushIngredients include lemongrass ndash of course ndash as well as bog myrtle, aloe vera, jojoba, neem and mango. It is a wholesome product: handmade, organic, palm oil-free, vegan-friendly and non-toxic. Available in a ml travel size.

It also helped soothe redness on existing bites.Visit maryjeanAnderson Aromatics Beastie Be Gone , poundBeastie Be Gone, which launched in May, was coined by Bothwell-based clinical aromatherapist and perfumer Julie Anderson-McKee.As someone who loves the outdoors ndash Anderson-McKee can often be found camping in a tent or a caravan by a loch ndash she knows only too well the blight of midges.The result is a triple action cream that combines insect repellent, SPF  protection and a moisturiser that can be used as an after sun. It comes with excellent credentials, including being vegan, hypo-allergenic and as Anderson-McKee puts it \"free from all nasties\".Tried and tested by  Scottish wild campers and walkers, among the ingredients are organic shea butter, coconut and almond oils, lavender, lemon eucalyptus, citronella and myrrh.Application consistency:A sumptuous cream in a sleek metal container.Smell:Pleasant hints of lemon and lavender.Verdict:An impressive new kid on the block that does what it says on the tin.Visit andersonaromatics"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-schools-four-key-updates-parents-ahead-reopening","story":"PARENTS across Scotland are eagerly anticipating confirmation that schools will go back full time next month.Primary and secondary schools across the country closed their doors back in March to all but a few children.But with coronavirus in Scotland being suppressed to very low levels, things are looking optimistic regarding ato the classroom.Yesterday, education secretary John Swinney provided an update on schools.Here are fourkey things we learned:Teachers:The Scottish Government yesterday announced pound million of funding to employ hundreds of teachers and support staff to help schools reopen.An extra pound million was also pledged to cover other health protection costs.The funding will equate to around  teachers and  support staff.But as Labourrsquos education spokesperson, Iain Gray, pointed out, that accounts for only half a new member of staff per school across Scotland.August   Councils and schools have been working to the August date for some time.But the Scottish Government will not formally announce the August date until July .The Scottish Government has repeatedly stressed that reducing the infection rate is crucial to the reopening of schools, with the First Minister earlier in the week suggesting no more lockdown changes will be made until pupils are back in the classroom.Mr Swinney stressed that in Scotland, the infection rate is ldquoreducing by  per cent each week, but a sudden surge in cases over the next few weeks could sht the Scottish Governmentrsquos confidence that it is safe to re-open schools.Some pupils may have to socially distanceSocial distancingMr Swinney gave parents some much-needed details about the social distancing guidance that schools will be asked to follow ndash but some questions still remain over how this will work in practice.While primary pupils will not have to socially distance when theyon August , all being well, secondary schools will be told to enforce physical distancing rules ldquowhere possible.Mr Swinney said this was due to the scientic advice on social distancing being ldquoless clear for older pupils.Meanwhile secondary schools will be asked to adjust the layout of classrooms and manage flows of people in and out of buildings ndash but with a catch.This social distancing rule in secondary schools will be ldquosubject always to this not reducing capacity within the school.Youth clubsAs well as earmarking pound million for school staff and pound million to help councils meet extra costs in reopening classrooms, pound million of previously announced money will be used to support youth work in connection with schools being reopened.Mr Swinney said this funding has been announced as the sector has ldquocontinued to support and engage children and young people through the pandemic, highlighting the use of digital technology to help mitigate the impact of the lockdown on young peoplersquos mental health."},{"url":null,"title":"staff-face-redundancy-borders-call-centre--","story":"STAFF are facing redundancy at a Galashiels call centre.Sykes has engaged its Nether Road employees in a consultation over their jobs.A Border reader, who said they work at the call centre, told us: \"It cant be helped but its devastating to be losing work at a horrible time.\"A spokesperson for Sykes said: \"After careful review we have started consultation about a reduction in the workforce at our Galashiels site.\"Staff were told about the job losses around three weeks ago, according to the employee who contacted the Border .The employee -

believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit.

initiative to provide additional space for physical distancing to protect public health, work has started on a temporary cycle route between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton which will run parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these

It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland. It was built in the late s by landowner Lord Seton so the community of priests could pray for his familyrsquos salvation.Finally on the coast there is Longniddry Bents, East Lothian largest tourist attraction.

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set. Theyre clear dots that extract impurities while also creating a protective layer over the pimple so nothing  can irritate itrsquo. Jessica also says that she makes sure to focus on her chin and lower face when washing her face since thats the area covered by a mask.The product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"food-chef-tom-kerridge-shares-passion-bbqs","story":"Barbecues at the ready because chef Tom Kerridge, holder of two Michelin stars, has a trove of summertime cooking treats to share.During the course of his new show, Tom Kerridge Barbecues - on the Food Network, the chef will be showing off some old and new recipes using charcoal, smoke and fire.He talks about his favourite dish from the series and why everyone - including professional chefs - are prone to barbecue disasters from time to time.How did this series come about \"I filmed with Food Network last year, a big series for the States, they gave me a call and said listen do you want to do something with barbecues... it was actually a really good, fun thing to do.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In April, when the country was in full lockdown, sales dropped by % and lost firms around poundm. The next month sales decreased by % and in June they were down by %. In March, when lockdown was introduced, sales fell by %.David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said the absence of office workers, students and tourists will continue to affect shops across the country.He explained: ldquoThese figures are stark and show that retail sales crumbled over the first four months of the pandemic.ldquoNot all retail sub-sectors were impacted equally, with fashion, clothing and footwear faring particularly poorly.ldquoShops and retail jobs depend on the ongoing patronage of the public and whilst the situation is gradually improving, it remains particularly acute in our city centres where stores are suffering huge drops in footfall.ldquoAny prolonged absence of office workers, students and tourists from Scotlandrsquos city centres will be hugely challenging for retail and hospitality businesses who rely on their custom, and who often already face high property costs.ldquoThis will have consequences for jobs, vacant premises, and tax revenues.In Westminster, the Business committee chairman Darren Jones MP has written to Alok Sharma, the businesses minister urging him to \"plug the gap\" in support for those ineligible for other schemes, citing evidence from another committee that around one million people in the UK had missed out.Crucially the committee has recommended extra support for sectors affected particularly badly from the pandemic, suggesting the Government \"review\" sectors \"suffering from acute problems resulting from social distancing and other health and safety measures with a view to providing additional support.\"Mr Jones said: \"Witnesses from a number of sectors, such as retail, the creative industries and manufacturing expressed concern that there would be increasing redundancies from August.

This included: pregnant women: being put on sick pay rather than being furloughed, which affected their statutory maternity benefit entitlement being made redundant before going on maternity leave and being pressurised into working in unsafe working environments.

long time, focused on servicing the night-time economy and there is a desire among city planners and local people, tothe area to its original, mixed use.ldquoCity centre living reduces commuting time, lowers the carbon footprint of commuting, retains more consumer spending within the city centrersquos local economy and provides day-time balance to the existing night-time economy.ldquoThis location is ideal for people looking to live in a vibrant, city-centre environment close to great shops, pubs and restaurants and some of the cityrsquos best transport links.Mr Emlick added: ldquoThe residential units will create signicant economic benefit to the local area, encouraging key workers and graduates to remain in the city and providing a highly-connected location for city-centre living.A heritage consultant has been retained to advise on the final design to ensure the proposed development reflects and enhances the appearance of the local conservation area and neighbouring

The Flow Country being the UKs candidate for World Heritage Site status to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in .Without UK Government support, the bid would have been sunk.The partnership says it now has a \"clear timetable\" to prepare and submit a full nomination to UNESCO, who will then determine whether or not The Flow Country meets the criteria for World Heritage Site status.The designationis given toareas judged to be of \"outstanding universal value\".Natural Environment Minister, Mairi Gougeon MSP said: ldquoScotlandrsquos inspiring natural environment creates a powerful sense of belonging which helps define us as a nation.

Raptors such as merlin, short-eared owls and golden eagles hunt over the moss and in its pools, frogs, snakes, shrews and dozens of species of insects thrive.Nicola Sinclair, chairman of Highland Councilrsquos Caithness committee, said: ldquoThis is a tremendous opportunity to acknowledge the value of the Flow Country and secure the wider recognition that it deserves.\"For those of us who live and work in Caithness and Sutherland, the Flow Country is a special part of our place, our history.

The Scottish government said last year it would put an extra poundm in funding to restore degraded areas of peatland in addition to the poundm awarded.Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland added: \"I know everyone involved in the application has worked so hard, and the Partnership should be very proud of their achievement."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-people-scotland-can-take-part-covid-19-vaccine-trial","story":"Speaking at the Scottish Governments daily briefing yesterday,Deputy chief medical officer Nicola Steedman asked members of the public to consider whether they could volunteer during the testing phase of the drug.Last week, findings from the early phases of a vaccine being created by Oxford University were published, with Ms Steedman saying the vaccine was both safe and created a ldquogood response in the more than  test subjects.She added: ldquoItrsquos still early days, but itrsquos definitely good news.Ms Steedman said: ldquoScience and research has never been more important than it is now.Larger-scale trials will be required to ensure that vaccines can be rigorously tested in the coming months and Ms Steedman has said a registry has been set up across the UK for people to sign up to be a part of Covid- trials.Ms Steedman said, adding: ldquoPlease do visit the online siteyou can and think about whether you, like so many others, can volunteer to help with vaccine trials.Online sign-up can be found at www.nhs.uk researchcontactIf you are interested in volunteering for #COVID vaccine studies, you can register and find out more at https:t.co ZYZzEbI https:t.co WhQfkZSsThe First Minister confirmedanother four positive cases of the virusin Scotland, bringing the total to ,.No deaths have been recorded in the last  hours, meaning the total number of fatalities remains at .But NicolaSturgeon said the Scottish Government is likely to adopt a ldquocautious approach to lockdown easing when its planned review takes place on Thursday.She warned there is a ldquoworrying resurgence of Covid cases globally and stressed the hospitality sector in Scotland must ensure it is adhering to guidelines put in place."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11637586.jpg?type=article-full","title":"new-scottish-independence-party-explains-game-plan-logos-officially-approved","story":"The Independence For Scotland Party run by Colette Walker, who last year ran for theSNPwomenrsquos convener position, was first mooted in May.The party has been classed as\"authorised\" by the Electoral Commission and hasnow approved the partys logos.Other pro-independencevehicles have been suggested, from the Independence for Scotland Partyto one led by Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell - who has in turn suggested former SNP leader Alex Salmond could set up his own group.Another indicating an intention to stand on the regional list vote at next years Holyrood election is the Alliance for Independence proposed by former SNP MSP Dave Thompson, which he envisions as an umbrella group uniting smaller pro-independence campaigns.In announcing the move to set up ISP in May, Ms Walkerposted: ldquoJust for the record, we are not going against the SNP, we are only putting candidates forward for regional list seats, I would seriously hope Nicola and I would want a majority of Indy MSPrsquos in Holyrood in .The partys mission statement stated: \"The objective of the ISP is building a pro-independence majority in Holyrood, to directly advance the cause of Scottish independence, and to do this while providing a political home for those who are not well represented by existing independence parties.\"Wersquore focused on Scottish independence and providing political balance to what has become a largely single party system.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I#m absolutely gutted.#The  year-old added: #I was on the top floor where the fire had started. Just as I was approaching my bedroom door I could hear the night porter running up and down shouting to please evacuate.#Mr Arbuckle described watching a firefighter running down the stairs of the building following an initial inspection.#We were just watching them working and getting prepared, and we were thinking #this is real now.##As we looked up to the centre of the Moorfield, that#s when flames started bursting out of the roof. We saw big, blue flames.#He said staff were eventually taken by bus to to stay at Sella Ness # the very accommodation which has been at the centre of controversy over the Moorfield#s closure.As well as having lost his belongings inside the building, Mr Arbuckle also fears he may well have lost his car # parked, as it was, outside the back of the building.#We#ve not been allowed near it because of the thickness of the smoke,# he said. #I#m not holding out any hope.##Everything I own has gone. I#ve not got a job any more -all my documents, my flash drive, I#m having to restart everything. It#s bad, bad times.#Sous chef Steven Mcdonnell said staff initially hoped it would be something minor.#For the first few minutes we were thinking #maybe somebody#s burnt the toast#, the  year-old said.But he said it soon became clear the fire was much, much more serious.#We were seeing flames from a window in the second floor. Things were getting hotter and hotter.#He also said blue flames began to appear, a sign # he added # that gas cylinders were catching fire inside the building.#We were escorted to an ambulance area, and the locals came out and started giving us blankets. Two buses pulled up and we were sent to Sella Ness, which was a bit of a bitter pill.#Nearby resident Georgia Smith, who lives around  yards from the scene, said signs first emerged of something wrong when her house began losing water pressure.#My dad woke up and looked out the window,# she said. #I heard, #the hotel#s on fire#. I looked out and saw a giant ball of fire. The whole roof was ablaze.#There were a lot of people down there. We watched as the workers all came out and went on the coaches and got shipped to Sella Ness.#Like many residents, Ms Smith was left shocked by the incident # not least because it took place almost exactly a year after an explosion ripped through a house in the area, resulting in the death of Peggy Grfiths.Alison Smith lives in Ockragarth, where that incident took place.#It#s a year on Thursday since Peggy#s house exploded and the poor woman passed away,# the  year-old said.Friend Maria Wishart of Lingapund added: #We could hear the firefighters and the smoke was going right across the voe. We could hear the pops and the cracks.#Another resident, who did not wish to be named, added she first became aware something was up when she heard crackling voices coming over on the radios used by firefighters who had arrived at the scene.#I woke up to the sound of walkie-talkies,# she said.#It#s almost a year to the day since that house explosion and now the Moorfield has gone.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Mr Allen says any new plans will require updated guidance as soon as possible. At present the school will essentially be split into two groups with some pupils in school for the first week of September and following their timetable for a week, while the others remain at home doing remote learning. That will be flipped for the second week and rotated on a week-in, week-out basis because we see no other way to do this while social distancing restrictions are in place. In my opinion, for all schools to be back as normal we need to see the total removal of social distancing restrictions.

Penny lost her hearing when she was a year-and-a-half but we didn#t know until her speech failed to develop, Lissa explained. With her speech delayed, she had her implants fitted last year so she had already lost quite a lot of development time, and then her nursery was closed for months due to the lockdown. It will be challenging enough for Penny entering school in terms of communication on top of all of this uncertainty around the virus. I#m concerned but I still want her to thrive as best she can and she needs an educational setting to do that.

He relies completely on lip reading and sign language to communicate. Obviously he has missed out on speech therapy, which he would have got in school over the past few months but for the lockdown. My main concern is getting Emmett back into school because he has missed out on so much and home schooling has been very hard over recent months due to his speech and developmental issues.He was in hospital recently and the staff had to wear face coverings, but at times he couldn#t understand what they were saying, as they cause mumbling.

Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.Ulster Bank said it was “strongly committed to lending to all kinds of mortgage borrowers - this includes those on furlough and those ing from furlough”.“As always, they base lending decisions on affordability and ability to repay and they take each case on an inidual basis.”A spokeswoman for Progressive Building Society said it is “a responsible lender and reviews and assesses every case on an inidual basis including the income and expenditure of all applicants”.HSBC said it will not lend to furloughed workers whoseto work date is further than three months away or there is nodate at all.Mortgage broker and advisor London  Country said: “Mortgage lenders have sought to support those on furlough through the lockdown period and in the main have continued to accept furloughed income when considering how much they can offer to borrowers. “That would of course often mean a reduced income and consequent reduction in the size of borrowing available but at least most lenders would be able to consider lending.  “As we move closer to the unwinding of the jobs retention scheme borrowers should expect to see more questions aboutto work and some lenders are now stipulating that they will want some confirmation. “Getting employer confirmation may not be possible for all at this stage but on the upside those that can, may be able to use theirto work income for the affordability assessment.  “That approach will be consistent whether for first time buyers or next time buyers as lenders will need to be able to demonstrate that the mortgage is affordable and will remain sustainable. “However the market is still light on deals for those with small deposits which is often a bigger issue for first time buyers and some of the lenders that have ed to the % LTV market will potentially set a higher expectation when it comes to credit score.”Belfast Most ReadRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Belfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s helpDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media posts,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The teenager#s body was discovered on August  beside a small stream about .km from the resort.Although her family believe there was a criminal element to what happened, police have said there was no sign the -year-old was abducted or raped.A preliminary post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.An inquest into her death is due to begin on August  and last until September .Denis Barror, the Dublin-based solicitor acting for Meabh and her French father Sebastien, declined to comment on the proceedings.Ms Brennan denied defaming the couple and said she was surprised that they were taking a case. I will be defending myself. I don#t believe they have a cause of action against me, she said.Ms Brennan said that while she wrote very extreme things on the social media , she believed them to be true. Facebook declined to comment.Ms Brennan is a former partner in a Dublin law firm, and specialised in employment and equality law. She retired in  due to an illness.She confirmed her Facebook account was suspended for  days last September but was reinstated and remains active.The case is the second set of proceedings initiated by the Quoirin family since the tragedy occurred. They are also suing the owner of the resort for alleged negligence.Confirming details of that case last January, Sankara Nair, a lawyer for Nora#s parents, said the family strongly believed she was abducted as she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit alleges a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared.It is also claimed the resort gate was left open without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for the reception area.According to the claim, Nora had poor motor skills and needed help to walk. Although in her mid-teens, her mental age was about five or six years.Mr Sankara said the resort was not safe for Nora and that anybody could have come in and taken her. In an interview with RTE News last December, Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin said they were determined to get truth and justice.I think we will seek justice in so far as we can. We have to find peace in our own hearts, said Meabh Quoirin.We will carry Nora with us forever. She#s with us here every day. I talk to her every day. She holds my hand. We hear her. We see her in all that we do at home.

We have to work towards a joint approach in relation to that.”Elsewhere, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, whose party has representatives on both sides of the border, said a united Ireland will not be possible due to the dferent health services.“Why would anyone from the North want to be part of a united Ireland when we have a dysal, two-tier health service,” he said.“They won’t do it.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For pound, fans will be able to watch over  live games from the comfort of their own homes, as attendances at games are set to be restricted this summer due to social distancing following the Covid- pandemic. Attendances have been restricted to a maximum of , depending on the layout of the clubs ground, which includes players from both teams and essential matchday personnel. The new service, #WeAreDerry, will be broadcast throughwww.derrygaa.ieand will livestream games from the county’s club football and hurling championships. googletag.cmd.push The service, which will be free to Club Derry members, will offer full deferred coverage of the majority of the remaining matches, like it previously did on Oakleaf TV. Gaels at home and abroad will be able to see nine live matches from the Derry senior football championship. It will include two group games, two last  matches, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final. The intermediate and junior finals and the senior hurling decider will all be livestreamed. Bellaghy and Loups game will be followed by the Round  clash of Glen and Magherafelt, a repeat of last seasons decider. googletag.cmd.push As an alternative to the full package, live games can be purchased inidually for a cost of pound. Our Championships in Derry are perennially among the most competitive anywhere in Ireland and our games regularly attract supporters from other counties across Ulster,” commented Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker. He felt it was important to maximise access to the club championship during the Covid- crisis. Social distancing will limit the attendance and other vulnerable members of the community, who may be shielding, will not be in a position to attend games. Our hurling and football championships are part of the rhythm of summer and autumn. Thanks to our new streaming service, supporters will still be able to see every important pass, block, point and goal that happens in Derry this summer. “Streaming of live matches is a hot topic at present so the uptake for the upcoming set of games will determine whether or not it has a future for our club championships,” Barker added. As a special introductory offer, a nine-month subscription will cost pound, normally pound per month.

On the flip side, he wasnt happy with the opening  minutes, when he felt their shot selection and decision making left a lot to be desired. “When we went out after the water break, that next  minutes was when we really hit top gear and we were awesome, hitting - to no reply to effectively kill the game,” he said of their - to - victory. McShane was pleased with how his side built on their - to - interval lead against the breeze in the second half. googletag.cmd.push Like their footballers, Slaughtneil have been used to playing on their more expansive bottom pitch, which was being rested in the off-season. “We were playing on a tighter pitchthan Owenbeg and you have to work that bit harder to make the space and we did create it in the second quarter,” McShane added, while stressing how well Ballinascreen got in around them. In the second half, Brendan Rogers added a fourth goal before Jerome McGuigan grabbed - inside two minutes in another purple patch from the champions. “I thought Jerome was absolutely awesome,” McShane said. “I know he ended up with a red card for a moment of madness on his part and it is something he will learn from. googletag.cmd.push “I thought his performance up to that was absolutely top class, he was absolutely unplayable and thats why he came in for a bit of harsh, up close and personal treatment...they had no other way of stopping him. “He made an unbelievable run in the first half and he left them all in his wake. He had bad luck when we tried to finish it and it hit the keeper.” Slaughtneil appeared to pull their half forward line deeper to maximise space and on top of Cormac ODohertys - tally, he was picking passes and dictating the game. “I always felt there was an extra  or  percent we could we get out of Cormac,” McShane stated. “This year he has stepped up and we are getting that. “I thought he was fantastic...his vision, his link play and his ability in the rucks to come out with the ball is second to none. He is the new captain of the team, he has that responsibility on his shoulders and he seems to be thriving on it and long may it continue.” RELATED- Slaughtneil ease to opening win of the season.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along.

I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk.

He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself. We did a lot of high altitude extreme rock climbs.

He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs.

I fully understand, and support the need for language ersity.”Complaints have been made about the post to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by Conradh na Gaeilge, an advocacy group for Irish language speakers, and a -year-old boy.Conradh na Gaeilge alleged the post is a breach of the House of Commons code of conduct, saying it was “offensive and insulting in nature to those who speak the Irish language”.In a complaint letter shared on Twitter, Adam Mac Giolla Easbuic, who attends an Irish Medium School in Dungiven – within Mr Campbell’s constituency – requested the commissioner investigates “racist undertones to both Germans and Irish speakers”.He wrote: “I find Mr Campbell’s comments extremely offensive and disrespectful.“It is clear that he learned nothing during the Acht na Gaeilge campaign for an Irish Language Act that me and all my friends took part in.“I don’t think his comments are suitable for an MP to make.“Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint. I hope that you will investigate this.”Disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein over an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland was a sticking point in political talks between the parties last year, ahead of the New Decade New Approach deal.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
