Aerospace bosses are calling for the government to accelerate their defence procurement programmes to aid companies whose civil aviation businesses have been badly hit, as airlines have cut back orders.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has signalled it would back the plans, which are also being pushed by unions, amid fears that aviation job losses, which are already in the tens of thousands, could grow further.The union Unite has proposed that the government accelerate the Tempest fighter jet programme, as well as committing to orders of its Type 31 and fleet solid support (FSS) ships.However, a document from the aerospace lobby group, the ADS, seen by the , suggests that the industry has found the Treasury unwilling to change the timing of spending commitments, which can run into the billions of pounds. Government borrowing has already surged during the crisis.The document describes the MoD, which is otherwise under pressure to reduce costs, as receptive to bringing forward spending. It notes, however, that “the challenge lies in persuading the Treasury that amending defence and space procurement budgets is appropriate at this stage”.Pressure on the UK government to support the aerospace industry has grown after the French government last week unveiled a €15bn (£13.5bn) package for the sector.The disparity in support has already led the Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury, to warn that its UK operations will face more permanent job losses than France or Germany. The European aircraft maker has cut a third of its production capacity. Steep cuts are also expected in its UK operations, focused on its wing factory in Broughton, north Wales.Rolls-Royce, the UK maker of jet engines, has already announced 9,000 job cuts, while Canadian planemaker Bombardier has shed 600 jobs in Northern Ireland.The UK government has also provoked the ire of the aerospace industry through the imposition of a 14-day quarantine on passengers arriving from abroad. The industry argues that the quarantine requirement will damage demand for new planes from airlines. An ADS spokesman said: “Our defence and space industries are well placed to act as a catalyst for economic recovery. National strategic projects such as the combat air strategy, shipbuilding and digital technologies can make a major contribution to national recovery, sustain important R\u0026ampD capabilities, support the supply chain and create long-term, high-value jobs for the future.”A Treasury spokeswoman said: “The government is in regular contact with the sector to assist them through this crisis. We recognise the challenges facing the industry as a result of coronavirus and firms can draw upon the unprecedented package of measures, including schemes to raise capital, flexibilities with tax bills and financial support for employees.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec087649d2505f6d493111eab2f2ac3b6868d15/0_44_2267_1359/master/2267.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bd8f34259282b7eb781469b5a75f1ca7","title":"beijing coronavirus second wave virus china","story":"The resurgence of Covid-19 has raised fears that China’s capital and its famous street life will never return to ‘normal’ For just one day, Beijing was a Covid-free city.On Tuesday 9 June, local authorities reported that the last active Covid-19 case had been discharged from a local hospital. City health officials appeared without face masks at the daily press conference, to announce that there were “no new cases and no suspected infections”. Beijing, finally, seemed to breathe a little easier. The now-ubiquitous temperature checks, at the entrance to every office building, restaurant and hutong (alleyway), were dismantled. The Lama Temple and Beijing aquarium were open to the public for the first time since January and were immediately packed to capacity. It was a beautiful summer’s day – bright blue skies and the sharp Beijing light that glints golden on the city’s tower blocks.On Wednesday 10 June, 52-year old Mr Tang – feeling inexplicably cold and exhausted – bicycled alone to a hospital for a checkup and tested positive for Covid-19. Beijing’s 56-day streak of no locally transmitted cases was broken, and all signs seemed to indicate that an outbreak had been quietly spreading through the city for weeks. The might of China’s public health system, honed after public criticism of the early response to Wuhan, was brought to bear. Over 100,000 contacts were identified for testing, tracing and isolation, and thousands of samples taken from stalls around the market. Xinfadi was the perfect storm for an uncontrollable new wave. In the worst-case scenario, as the key hub for the city’s food supply, it had first-degree connections to most restaurants, bars and community markets across Beijing. Expand that circle by one degree, and you had every delivery worker and every restaurant-goer as a potential vector for spread.By 12 June, 36 cases linked to the Xinfadi market were discovered. Cases began to pop up elsewhere in the country, connected to Beijing. China’s vice-premier called the situation “grave”, prompting fears of more sweeping lockdowns.Relatively speaking, it was a small outbreak. By comparison, New York City reported 292 new cases on 12 June alone. Nevertheless, Beijing was put in what health officials called “wartime mode” to contain the virus, mobilising medical workers like troops against an insurgency. But who it felt like “war” for, in this case, was determined by social class and geographic proximity.Many of the initial cluster of cases were working-class migrants: restaurant workers who lived in the same dormitory, seafood sellers, drivers. Thousands of frontline retail workers were tested over the next few days. Videos shared on WeChat showed many being made to wait shoulder-to-shoulder for hours in crowded stadiums and parks in the searing summer heat.In “exclusion zones” around multiple Beijing markets, residential lockdowns and severed transport links were patrolled by battalions of hazmat-clad volunteers. But walk around the hutongs around Beijing’s Art Museum – an area of upscale shops and restaurants – and you could see that nothing was different: barbecue stalls spilled out into the street and raucous picnics continued with face masks around the chin.A curious tension emerged between the need to project normality, and to show decisive action. Another full lockdown would be disastrous for Beijing’s economy, but so would an uncontrolled outbreak. For the city’s service industries, this led to confusing mixed messages. Bars in some neighbourhoods were told to stay open as normal, then close, then open for a limited time contingent on testing, then close, all within hours.For the rest of the city, a familiar mix of dread and powerlessness returned. Over 2 million tuned into the livestreams of the daily Covid-19 press conferences, with officials now wearing face masks again. Even the memes were melancholy – a popular one featured a person marked “Beijing”, in full plate-mail armour like a medieval knight, who is then hit by a precise arrow, marked “Xinfadi”, right through the helmet’s eye socket. The shopping district of Sanlitun, which surely features the city’s highest density of cafes per capita, took on a deserted look as bars and restaurants closed.Beijing residents are used to the city changing suddenly before their eyes, but the pandemic and its lockdowns have produced a creeping feeling that something has been lost for good. Beijingers feel as if they’ve emerged into a new city and started new lives. The particular liveliness associated with Beijing street life, exemplified by the word renao (热闹), was the first thing to disappear in lockdown, and will likely be the last to return. The cornerstones of the city’s renao: live music, nightclubs, cinemas, karaoke bars, lamb skewers around tiny plastic tables on the street – are all “closed until further notice”.Where a reopening seemed imminent a week ago, this resurgence has pushed that possibility out into a distant future. On 18 June, officials from China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that the outbreak was already “under control”, but the experience has already revived familiar fears – that future plans are null and void, replaced by an endless present of “doom-scrolling” through social media for news and rumour.A second wave opens the possibility of a third, and a fourth. In Beijing, a city that came so close to “defeating” the virus for good, that means whatever happens, we don’t get to go back to the city we knew.• Krish Raghav is an illustrator and writer based in Beijing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d751a7b41aa01c91279f3d1c420cd22987327e40/0_872_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816918a5aba17c9abbbc8788366edbc8","title":"kristin scott thomas alan bennett monologues lockdown i want action camels 600 extras","story":"Kristin Scott Thomas can thank lockdown for one thing: it’s made her stay put. But now she is craving the bright lights and buzz of a film set…If you went for a stroll in Rutland during the early days of lockdown, enjoying your daily dose of exercise in England’s tiniest county, you might have been interrupted by the sight of a strange woman ranting about her antiques shop and a dying neighbour. It was Kristin Scott Thomas, rehearsing her lines for an Alan Bennett Talking Heads monologue hurriedly commissioned by the BBC when production on other shows had to stop. Nicholas Hytner, former director of the National Theatre, has revived the series of one-actor plays, in which Scott Thomas plays Celia, a woman approaching retirement age with a struggling business and an accidentally cunning plan for how to make some cash.“The script was quite difficult to learn, actually, so I’d go on very long walks, and anyone coming across me in the lanes here would find me shouting with a piece of paper in my hand. Or people would roll down the car windows: ‘Are you lost dear?’ Did they recognise me? Oh I don’t think so – I’m not sure I have much of a fanbase in Rutland,” says Scott Thomas with a wry smile. Or rather, with a Kristin Scott Thomas smile, the one that suggests that the actor has been in on a magnificent joke for much of her 60 years, and that it hasn’t stopped being discreetly amusing yet.We are speaking over video from our laptops, she in a bedroom of a house she describes as being “in the middle of nowhere”, where she sometimes lies back languorously on her bed as she talks, sometimes sits up on it, and sometimes stops to wonder why her screen has gone dark. Somehow, her smart yellow dress remains immaculate throughout, as does her dignity when I ask if she is living in this rather random part of the country alone, or with a partner, and is this her own bedroom, with the matching set of landscape paintings in gold frames on the walls?I know the Paris chapter of her life and her marriage to a French doctor ended some years ago, their three children now having grown up and made her a grandmother. But Scott Thomas’s magnificent smile suggests that she will not lay out any further details of her love-life. She will say that this is her home, that after constantly travelling and working in different places, lockdown has made her realise “that I really am here now. And I think, I have been for quite a while, actually, but in denial. I try and make one French film a year. Do you know, I figured out that I haven’t stayed in the same place for more than two weeks for about 10 years? It’s just, my life – it got totally out of control.” So aside from her “heebie jeebies” about the virus, “doing this enforced keeping still has actually been incredibly beneficial to me personally, but my God was I terrified when it started.” Then she adds that she’s “got to go and open some windows, because the fire alarm’s just gone off and there’s the smell of burned toast, so God knows what’s going on”. Later, she says something that makes her sound exactly like Celia, her Talking Heads character, and admits that “my boyfriend always says I’m turning into her!” So there we go.The Talking Heads monologues were originally broadcast on BBC1 in the late 1980s (with a second series in the late 1990s), having been written by Alan Bennett in the days when putting plays on television wasn’t such a strange idea. Julie Walters, Maggie Smith and Patricia Routledge all performed, as did Bennett himself. Of course, under lockdown the idea has been revived, with the National, among other theatres, streaming recordings of their hit plays on YouTube, while other actors and comedians try to revive the art of monologue from home and even The Archers attempts to use the medium. (Fleabag began as a one-woman show, so there is recent precedent.) But Talking Heads became an instant classic of its day. I studied the scripts for Drama GCSE in the 1990s.Now, 10 of the 12 originals are being revived with a new cast (along with two new ones, also written by Bennett) thanks to Hytner, who has enjoyed a long working relationship with Bennett, and who came up with the idea of getting certain actors to come into a studio and do a socially distanced performance. The part of Celia, in a piece called The Hand of God, played in the original by Eileen Atkins, required a shop, “which we created in the most extraordinary place in the world,” says Scott Thomas, with some excitement, “on the set of The EastEnders!I suddenly found myself on Albert Square – in the hairdressing salon, made into a very nice antiques shop. I’m years out of date with the show, but it’s still iconic, it’s still oh my God, pinch pinch pinch,” she says, jabbing her arm, as the sun streams through her Rutland window. “There is a member of my family I should not mention by name who is obsessed. So much more impressed than by me working with Robert Redford.”She laughs. In fact, she was thrilled to get out of isolation and back near a stage, if only to play a character experiencing her own form of isolation. Scott Thomas drove down to the studios. She has been worried about catching Covid-19, and won’t go to the local shop “without looking like a total lunatic because I’m covered. I’ve got a mask on, I’ve got a headscarf on, I’ve got glasses on because I just don’t want to get sick and I’m still terrified of catching it. Horror. A lot of the older people in the shop here don’t really understand social distancing, so there’s a lot of, ‘Excuse me love can I just get that cabbage?’ So I’m covered up. And a friend of mine did get it and ended up in hospital, ICU, for 10 days or something. Terrible. I know so many people who have had it. And you know, because I’m, I’m getting towards the age group of people who are more vulnerable myself…” She puts on a funny voice. “Slowly tiptoeing towards it,” she adds, sounding in character once again.We discuss how good Alan Bennett is at writing these older females she believes he is partly responsible for British culture revering such women. She says that when America does the same they tend to be cute and funny, like Shirley MacLaine, or Jane Fonda in Grace and Frankie. Whereas here, there is huge dramatic reverence for Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith. “We think of these ladies as being iconic. We’ve been hugely successful in our celebration of the important old ladies. It’s actually very encouraging. And possibly because we’ve got an amazing Queen, I don’t know. But I do think part of that has to do with people like Alan Bennett, who write these incredibly generous-spirited pieces where you kind of fall in love with the character. I think that’s very specific to this country. When Glenda Jackson does Lear, you know, that is a very extraordinary event. When Maggie Smith did her one-woman show at the Bridge Theatre it was amazing. When Judi does anything we all fall over in awe.”So is it time to bury the lie that there are no roles for older women? “Well it’s not a lie – these are seniors. It’s the inbetweenies who are in trouble,” she says, going on to reference the stand-alone brilliance of Lesley Manville in the comedy series Mum.As for Celia, who befriends a dying neighbour for reasons that may not be as benevolent as she wants to think, is she a wicked woman? “She sort of falls into it, rather than is wilfully wicked. I think she just trips. This is what I love about Alan’s writing: all the tumbling that happens. His people tumble and they kind of catch themselves, and they do that in the language, and I think that’s what is going on with this woman who has found herself in a certain situation. If she stopped to think about it, she’d be mortified, but she’s managed to convince herself that she’s being a good friend. And I think that that’s why we’re all so drawn to these characters, because they make mistakes. You can’t really blame them for their mistakes, even though you feel a bit shifty about them. You can’t really condone them either. I think people identify with them so much, because he’s so generous with them. There’s always a little something in there you can recognise as being a human trait. It’s like Chekhov, he writes the most appalling characters and they do the most appalling things, but you can’t help but love them. You have compassion for them. You feel, ah yes, I know you.”Has she met Alan Bennett? She shakes her head furiously. “No, I’m way too shy to. I’ve been in the same room as him, but I’m way too, kind of, gobsmacked to be able to speak to him. I mean, why would he be interested? You know that thing, when you don’t dare speak to people?” I’m surprised. I tell her I thought she’d dare speak to him. She sighs. “I know.” She pauses. “People think that about me, too. They don’t dare speak to me either. It’s all silly, just human. I can’t stand it. I’d love it if people thought they could talk to me. Because… ugh… I don’t know. I have heard it said about me, you know, ‘You’re too grand,’ or ‘You’re too this’, or they admire you too… whatever it is.” She admits she has the same “totally natural inhibition” towards others, “which is, you know, what have I got to offer this person?”Of course, it is at this moment that my daughter wanders into the room and starts talking to the nice lady on my screen who doesn’t seem remotely daunting to her, all friendly with her shiny gold jewellery on, asking my little girl if she likes going to the theatre, too, and saying, “Oh, sweet!” when she finds out she is only eight. When it transpires we have all started growing vegetables for the first time in lockdown – and after my child has wandered off again – Scott Thomas muses on whether she could now make smalltalk with strangers about her newfound hobby of “potting”.“I got the seeds and I just thought, God, these aren’t going to work, so you just plant gazillions of them. And then they all worked!” She sounds truly delighted. “So I’ve been busy handing them out: ‘Would you like some spinach? How about 10 broad bean plants?’ It got completely out of control. I had to leave a pile of them at the end of the gate. But watching something grow, corny as it may sound, from a tiny little unidentifiable seed into a plant, is just the most amazingly encouraging thing. And it did help me feel less anxious. Because you see that things are carrying on regardless. Nature is stronger than us, it really is.”Has she been going downstairs in the morning and then tiptoeing out to see how the beans are doing?“Cup of tea in hand, in a woolly hat! Completely perfect Alan Bennett character. It’s totally terrifying.”Secretly, she is ready to get back on to a film set now, though. “Because we’re not going to live on monologues for much longer! Endless monologues. People looking into their cameras like this, people looking at Zoom like this. I want action, I want deserts, I want camels, I want 600 extras. Oh, apparently we’re going to have to CGI in the extras as well, according to this article I read this morning. And they’re going to try to encourage the leading actors not to face each other.” She is whooping with laughter now. “It’s going to be nonsense! How are we going to make movies? I’ve got things that are supposed to be shooting now, and I keep getting told by everybody, ‘Don’t worry, don’t worry it will happen.’ Yes, but when?”The only people who have given her a clear answer are at the National Theatre, where she was supposed to be fulfilling a lifelong ambition and playing Phaedra this December. It is cancelled, but she hopes only postponed. In fact, she laughs when realising that this monologue with Nick Hytner is the first time she’s worked with him. “I was so glad when he asked me to do something at bloody long last! I’ve known him for years and years and years. I was always saying why can’t I come and work at the National, why can’t I? Rah rah rah. He had to leave the National before I got asked to do anything. And now it’s cancelled.”But for now, she is landlocked in Rutland. “I’m basically a country person anyway. I spent my entire childhood in a tiny village until I was 18. And then I went to London. And then I went to Paris. I’ve always longed for this and now I’ve got it by accident. And really, really got into it.”She does admit that she’s fed up and longing for a night out. “I want lockdown to end so that I can go to the theatre, so I can see friends. Sit me in the dark with a whole load of other people experiencing the same message in different ways and taking it all in. I want dinner with my friends and a show. And even more, I want to be in a show. I want to do some acting now. I’m bored with being beany.”Talking Heads is on BBC One and BBC iPlayer on Tuesday 23 June from 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206fc4b306bd65f119d7fe59e3cbdc7a4cc96f4b/0_300_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba271bc95756eb058a2228236d011ab","title":"from panic buying to food banks how britain fed itself in the first phase of coronavirus","story":"From farmers to supermarket chiefs to frontline workers, this is the inside story of the food supply chain and Covid-19. Were we prepared for the storm – and what happens next? For Kim McMaster the crisis began on 21 March. Each Saturday night she visits the vast Tesco Extra on Sheffield’s Savile Street to collect surplus food on behalf of the Norfolk Park Tenants and Residents Association. It’s then redistributed to about 100 people in need through a community pantry scheme run out of a local church. “Normally there will be eight to 10 trays waiting for us,” she says. “Fresh fruit, veg, eggs, bread, a full mix.” That Saturday there were no fresh vegetables at all. There really wasn’t much of anything. “There were just two trays. The manager was very upset. He said the shop had been stripped bare so there wasn’t any surplus.”In London, at the Deptford headquarters of FareShare, the charity which redistributes food from throughout the supply chain that would otherwise go to waste, the story was becoming horribly familiar. As well as receiving deliveries direct from supermarkets and producers into their warehouses, FareShare has 7,000 affiliated charities across the country – food banks, community kitchens and the like – which, as with the Norfolk Park group , collect surplus direct from inidual branches. But those supermarkets suddenly had nothing to give. “Almost overnight these charities had their supply cut off at the knees,” says the chief executive, Lindsay Boswell. “There was nothing we could do.”It is one acute story from the frontline of the Covid-19 lockdown of 2020. We have all experienced the crisis in different ways. For some it has been the tedium of enforced idleness for others, the life-changing trauma of loved ones lost to the disease. The one universal has been the daily drudge of keeping ourselves and our families fed, as a complex food supply chain creaked, wobbled and at times seemed at risk of collapse. We have queued outside supermarkets. We have scanned bare shelves. We have refreshed online shopping sites repeatedly until our fingers have cramped. For those charged with keeping those shelves stocked it has been a challenge without precedent one that appears to have been met. The question is, for how long?\u0026nbspMany in the UK’s food industry admit the storm crept up on them. “In early February I’d just finished a meeting with Chris Kebbell, the counsellor for agriculture at the New Zealand High Commission,” says Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents the sector’s manufacturers. “He said: ‘So what are you going to do to prepare for quarantine?’ I asked him, what do you mean? He said: ‘Something big is coming.’”Over at Sainsbury’s Patrick Miller, who heads the 50-strong team responsible for the company’s non-fresh goods supply chain, had noticed a change. “It was February half term. We recognised a move in customer behaviour. They were topping up on things like rice and pasta, products they could tuck away in cupboards.”On 2 March Bruno Monteyne, a former Tesco executive turned business analyst with global investment firm Alliance Bernstein, published a startling newsletter predicting panic buying, empty shelves and even food riots, with the army deployed to protect stores. “Yes, it will be chaotic (and expect pictures of empty shelves),” he wrote, “but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.”The analysis, which many in the food retail sector admit was their first hint of what was to come, was based on war gaming that Tesco had done back around 2010. “There were training days with all the senior people,” Monteyne says now. “The objective was to think our way through a scenario exactly like the one we have now.”A similar exercise was repeated just four years ago by Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis. They imagined what would happen if they had to shut down the head office. “At the time people said it was a bit ridiculous and extreme,” Lewis said recently.\u0026nbspNewspapers and websites filled with reports of panic buying, of people squabbling over packs of toilet roll, of the elderly and infirm failing to fight their way to what they needed crucially, of exhausted NHS workers coming off shift and being unable to buy food for their families. “It wasn’t panic buying,” says Wright. “It was perfectly logical buying.” People knew that something big really was coming.At the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Chris Tyas, a former executive from Nestlé, was brought in to head the Food Resilience Industry Forum. It was a clear sign that the government was, in the words of Tim Lang, veteran professor of food policy at City University, going to “leave it to Tesco”. Feeding the nation was now a matter for the retailers.From 26 March, every day at 8am the forum held a phone conference involving up to 120 people from the industry (it now meets twice weekly). Through the forum, the major retailers lobbied government to relax competition law, so the likes of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons could agree to the same limits on how many packets of pasta or rolls of toilet paper each customer could buy. Delivery hours for trucks were relaxed, so they could keep restocking supermarkets after hours.\u0026nbspLater, the forum was called upon to sort one major issue: lack of supply into the UK’s vital convenience stores. “Massive buying swept into our sector about five to seven days after it reached the supermarkets,” says James Lowman of the Association of Convenience Stores. And, if anything, trade was up even more than in the supermarkets. “We had the same number of customers but they had gone from spending around £9 each visit to over £16.”There are more than 45,000 convenience stores on the UK mainland and they were all now finding it tough to get stock. “Less was going to the wholesalers who supply them because it was going to the supermarkets,” says Lowman. “That’s partly market forces. You don’t piss off your biggest customers.“It has been exhausting for our members. They’ve traded well but they’ve incurred extra costs and are wrung out. And they’ve done so at great personal risk.” Indeed. An analysis by the Office for National Statistics found that people in food and hospitality trades were at much higher than average risk of dying from Covid-19.\u0026nbspBack at FareShare, Lindsay Boswell found that the closure of the hospitality sector was a temporary godsend. “Very quickly we were being offered enormous amounts of food from that supply chain,” he says. “It went into our warehouses and we redirected our charities there.” They needed it because, as the economy stuttered to a halt, many workers, and especially the self-employed and those dependent on the gig economy, found themselves in dire straits.In Sheffield, McMaster switched from a pantry model to delivering food packages door to door. “We went from supporting 100 people to supporting 400,” she says. It was a similar story in London. “A charity in central London which used to provide two meals a week for 70 people is now running a daily service for 300 people,” says Boswell. Some of that was down to food charities closing down their operations. But much of it was simple demand. As Boswell says: “In April FareShare provided food for 11.6 million meals. That’s three times more than we’d ever done before.”At Agriculture House, the headquarters of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) just south of Coventry, Boris Johnson’s 16 March press conference was received with mounting anxiety. “I watched it in my office with a number of colleagues,” says Philip Hambling, the NFU’s head of food and farming. “We immediately knew there was going to be an impact for some of our members because of the closure of the hospitality sector. The problem was judging exactly the size and shape of it, because nothing like this had ever happened before.”If there was a vertical relationship between farmers and retailers, so that food products simply went to where they were required, everything would have been fine. But it doesn’t work like that. “There are many dairy farmers who supply processors, who in turn only supply cafes and restaurants rather than retailers,” Hambling says. “They had the door slammed in their face.” Even though there was increased demand from those retailers, there were dairy farmers who were forced to pour milk away, and even consider culling cows.The government also announced that it would be sending the most vulnerable a weekly food package, passing the bulk of the heavy lifting to the food service companies, Brakes and Bidfood. Many recipients posted pictures on social media of what they had received. A lot expressed gratitude for the government’s intervention. However, they also questioned the contents. While there was a fair amount of fresh fruit, the packs were heavy with simple carbs – white bread, white pasta – and low in protein. What protein there was seemingly came from an enormous consignment of Fray Bentos chicken meatballs. Likewise in Bristol, Peter Overton, a clearly exasperated primary school headteacher, tweeted a picture of the dismal offering for pupils on free school meals for a week: alongside a piece of fruit a day, there were biscuits, crisps, a loaf of cheap sliced bread and a block of fat specifically marked as for baking only. “The school pays the contractor £11 for this,” wrote Overton. “Shameful!”He was not the only one with doubts. On 1 April, a letter signed by leading academics was sent to both Defra and Public Health England (PHE) calling on them to establish an expert committee to oversee nutrition during the crisis. “It would have made sure that the 1.5 million people who received food parcels weren’t sent the crap that arrived,” says Prof Tim Lang, the letter’s author. “And that school meals were similarly audited.” Defra replied on 28 April saying nutrition was a matter for Public Health England. Two weeks later PHE replied, saying the matters raised were “for ministers”. They had at least been consistent: both had said the nutritional health of the nation wasn’t their problem.Now, here we are in late June, with the lockdown easing. Save for a few gaps, such as flour and yeast, the shelves are mostly full again. “To some degree it’s an impressive achievement to have got it all back so quickly,” says Wright. Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium agrees. “We were worried about fresh produce as we are dependent on much of that coming from Spain, which had its own problems, but we didn’t see any drop off.”Lang, who published a major book on Britain’s fragile food security just as lockdown started, is less convinced. “My critics have said we were wrong, there was no mass starvation. It was messy but we got it sorted. Well yes, but that’s because it’s been an extraordinary bonanza for food retail.” And it worked, he says, because “Europe fed us”. Boswell has his own concerns. “My main message is please don’t think this crisis is over. I’m terrified of the long-term issues, of the number of people who are going to need the help of frontline charities for a while to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493adc5855ad75ddd2ce4aa02a30bc3d329eff0b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43f1d0fcb881eb0658508948f86429a6","title":"what ive learned from cooking with chefs online","story":"Watching Massimo Bottura cook at home is a confidence-builder for amateurs – but a melancholy reminder of the restaurant meals we’re missingThe last time I watched Massimo Bottura on Instagram, life in his kitchen was, as ever, a little chaotic. Bottura’s wife, Lara, glamorous in white jeans, told a rambling anecdote at the top of her voice. His son, Charlie, somehow ended up with whipped cream on his cheek. His daughter, Alexa, could as usual be heard hurriedly translating her father’s running thoughts from Italian to English. As for the Michelin-starred chef himself, he was in particularly fine voice. “Ragazzi! Ragazzi!” he shouted, trying (and failing) to get everyone’s attention. Italy’s lockdown having finally been eased some days before, however, the mood was also valedictory. Freedom – and work – now beckoned once again: perhaps this would be one of the last times the Botturas would entertain us at home. “This is a real leftovers meal,” Alexa explained, as her dad made an elaborate pile of some dry-looking chocolate breakfast pancakes, a few slices of banana, and a large dollop of preserved cherries.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGazing at this toppling confection, I wondered vaguely if he was taking the piss. But, no. At the stove, more serious work was under way. “Look!” instructed Alexa. “This is a pasta that thinks it is a risotto.” In a pan into which he had crushed some plum tomatoes, Bottura tipped a bag of tiny macaroni – the kind you might usually add to soup. He then added a ladle of broth made from the liquid in which he’d cooked (separately) both some mussels and some pork belly, and stirred. Things, it must be said, did not look terribly promising. In the mix, we could see two pale cloves of garlic, bobbing like white sharks in a blood red sea, and a small, floating tree in the form of a huge bouquet garni. He stirred some more. He added some more broth. And on and on. Finally, he threw in the mussels and pork, a few lumps of cold butter (“to bring down the temperature and to make it creamy!”), and a sprinkling of orange zest, grated from a fruit that was roughly the size of Jupiter, and which had been sent to him by a kind friend in Sicily. Pronto. The pasta was now ready for the table.\u0026nbspTo what culinary rules, if any, did this improbable dish subscribe? I’m still not sure, though pork and mussels are, I know, often eaten together in Spain. But then, Kitchen Quarantine isn’t intended to be what we might call a precision-based venture. Filmed on Alexa’s mobile phone at the family home in Modena (the Italian city that’s also home to Bottura’s three Michelin-starred restaurant, Osteria Francescana), the family’s Instagram series, broadcast nightly throughout Italy’s long and severe lockdown, is a confidence-builder for cooks everywhere – not because it tells us exactly what to do, but because it reminds us that, if we keep things simple, they’ll usually come out all right in the end. A bit of this. A bit of that. Stir, taste, repeat. This is improvisational cooking for dummies – albeit dummies who might have a certain flair for drama and a decent supply of parmesan. To watch Bottura eat cold mozzarella on toasted day-old focaccia is to know that when it comes to food, the good and the elaborate are not necessarily the same thing.\u0026nbspKitchen Quarantine began almost by accident. Stuck at home, and having been furloughed from her job at Maserati, Alexa filmed her father cooking the family’s supper. It was a spur of the moment thing. But then, as she told the New Yorker, she focus-grouped the result on FaceTime. People told her that they liked what they saw and wanted more, so she duly kept going. Thanks to her efforts, the charming, warm, lovable and deeply Italian Bottura family have since become something of an internet sensation: more than half a million people watched the video in which Massimo made béchamel sauce. Last month, he won a special achievement prize at the Webby awards in recognition of this “inspirational” project.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBottura’s shaggy-haired charisma – in spectacles, he looks more like a shrink than a chef – has certainly played a big part in the success of Kitchen Quarantine: who wouldn’t want to be sequestered for a while with so energetic a man? But he’s hardly the only cook to have migrated to the internet. Across the world, restaurants have been closed for weeks, and while in some countries they’re now beginning to reopen – Osteria Francescana is once again taking bookings there will even be, for the first time in its history, tables available on Sundays – in the UK, they’re not expected to reopen until July. With time on their hands, and a desire both to inspire and to remain present in the minds of their customers, where else might professional cooks usefully appear?\u0026nbspThose keen on cookalongs can go high end, and watch other Michelin-starred chefs: you might also like to road test Jason Atherton’s Social Kitchen Isolation (Atherton’s empire includes the Pollen Street Social), in which he makes chicken and leek pies and Thai curries. Or they can go mainstream: the executive chefs of both Wagamama and Nando’s are online now, should you be yearning for a certain kind of katsu curry or peri-peri chicken. My favourites, however, are the demos available from Bread Ahead, the excellent bakery in Borough Market (every day at 2pm an ingredients list is published in advance if you intend to join in) from Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich of Honey \u0026amp Co. (roll your own vine leaves) and from Padella, Tim Siadatan’s genius no-bookings pasta restaurant (though he posts less frequently than some, the good news is that his demo of perfect pici cacio e pepe is already up). But whether high or low(er), these offerings all have one thing in common. What’s great about them is that unlike, say, cookery shows on TV, there’s no padding or guff any cosiness is real, not staged. And herein lies the secret of their infectious accessibility. Direct and intimate, you absorb small tricks of the trade without even realising it.\u0026nbspBut if videos aren’t your thing, there are other options. I love Home Cooking, a podcast by Samin Nosrat, the American cook best known for the Netflix series based on her book Salt Fat Acid Heat: especially the fourth episode, in which she and her co-host, Hrishikesh Hirway, discuss everything from chocolate mousse to what to do with a surfeit of ginger, after which they’re joined by special guest Yo Yo Ma (listening to him talk about the Parisian bakeries of his childhood is wonderful – almost, though not quite, as good as listening to him play Bach’s complete cello suites). Or maybe you prefer to read. In the wake of Covid-19, several new platforms for food writing have sprung up, among them Vittles, a “food newsletter for novel times”, whose contributors include Ruby Tandoh, and In Digestion, a weekly survey of the best food media on the web “and why you should care about it”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe overall effect of this mass shift to the internet is, broadly speaking, one of democratisation. Not only is all this information free. The playing field is more level: whether a cook is young and little known, or older and long-established, they’re all using the same means to get across their message. In lockdown, moreover, everyone is muddling through, even the most skilled among us: Srulovich seems to approach his fridge just as trepidatiously as the rest of us right now – which is reassuring. It’s not that perfection has been consigned to the past rather, that it has been redefined. It is messy and human. When Bottura was making his risotto-style pasta, a rogue mussel landed in his pan ahead of the others. For a while, he did not notice (I felt like I was watching a panto: “Look!” I wanted to shout. “It’s there, behind that tomato!”). When he finally did spot it, though, he was eager to point it out. “If my clumsiness doesn’t worry me, why should yours worry you?” he seemed to be saying, prodding the alien mollusc with his wooden spoon. In this world, a shrug is everything. It may be more reassuring even than knowing your weighing scales are accurate and to hand.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI have to admit that there are days lately when my laptop is a very useful bit of kitchen kit. But I’m not entirely convinced this shift will be permanent. Or perhaps I mean that I hope it won’t be. If there’s joy in all this cooking, there’s melancholy in it, too. It reminds us powerfully of what we miss. For one thing, where are all the people? Who, I sometimes ask myself, am I doing all this cooking for? How good it would be to have people round, to hear them coo over my star anise-scented chicken pilaff and my salted chocolate blondies (my two great triumphs so far).\u0026nbspFor another, there are our shuttered restaurants, about which, with every day that passes, I worry more. We miss them a lot, whether Pizza Express or… well, think of your own favourite: that beloved place that you turn to first for comfort or celebration. It is said that people are trying to replicate restaurant experiences at home, and I think there’s truth in this. Those serious restaurants that have ploughed their efforts into home delivery are doing brisk trade, even if this cannot, for their owners, begin to make up what they are losing financially: I’m planning to order from Orasay, Jackson Boxer’s marvellous London fish restaurant, for my birthday next month. I’ve also taken to replicating, as others also have, certain restaurant twiddles at home. The other night, I put a load of chips (oven chips!) in a newspaper cone, which I then placed inside a pewter tankard that belonged to my dad – a stab at making us feel we were eating our goujons of sole in a certain swanky West End place rather than in our basement kitchen.\u0026nbspIn truth, I’ve had enough both of my screen and of my own cooking for now. Food and people: they cannot, and should not, be separated. I long to be out in the world again. I long for the clatter of cutlery, and the sound of strangers laughing for the good-humoured crush of a bar, and the murmured approval of a maître d’. I want a wine list, even if it is overpriced, and napkins as big as sails. I want a little pat of butter, and a basket full of warm bread. I want proper chips, and I want pudding, even if I’m full. I want to run for the bus afterwards feeling slightly tipsy, and go to bed thinking of whatever delicious thing it was that I ate – a dish made with love and skill and with which I had no involvement whatsoever save for the fact that I willingly scoffed it all down.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90518c15838f4f448da9f825c83a2803975ebf93/0_221_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e53de590bcea183e04af29075aa061e5","title":"pep guardiola seeking motivation from manchester city leroy sane","story":"Pep Guardiola hopes Manchester City’s all-but-certain surrendering of the Premier League title to Liverpool will give his team an extra edge next season.A year ago Guardiola’s team became the first to win consecutive titles for a decade.

Being a science journalist with a training in law, however, she wanted proof.She began looking through hundreds of academic papers and interviewing scores of researchers about extreme experiments with mice and monkeys, and scary biological phenomena such as zombie cells (AKA senescent cells, the bloated, not-quite dead matter that accumulates as we age, belching out toxins and turning other cells into zombies). Her research expanded beyond the scientific, taking in a Portuguese longevity bootcamp, a Polish hugging salon and a flower-pressing session for Japanese octogenarians before circling back to France, home to the world’s oldest certified centenarian.By the time Jeanne Calment died, in a nursing home in Arles, on 4 August 1997, aged 122 years and 164 days, she had become a poster girl for longevity (although quite how long she lived has been disputed by some). She claimed to have known Van Gogh and regaled journalists\u0026nbspwith tales of her smoking and drinking. “But these were lies,” writes Zaraska. Calment only picked up smoking for two years, well after her 110th birthday. Zaraska warns of falling for longevity yarns, many of which turn out to be the product of fantasy.So, what are your chances if you are none of those things? It is hardly news that unhappy people generally don’t live as long as happy ones. Zaraska contends, though, that one of the most damaging forms of unhappiness is loneliness. Thankfully – for those of us still in a state of semi-lockdown – this is not the same as being socially isolated. While lockdown was still in place in Zaraska’s village in northern France, the health workers were cheered every night. “You couldn’t see people, but you could hear them you knew you were doing something together.” Loneliness is different: “You can have plenty of people around you and still feel lonely.”\u0026nbspIt all goes back to our hunter-gatherer past and the different strategies needed to protect ourselves. The feeling of loneliness signalled the sort of isolation that put early humans in danger of animal attack. In the absence of passing lions, it now generates a constant, low-burning stress. This could lead to chronic inflammation, which is associated with everything from cancer and rheumatoid arthritis to diabetes and Alzheimer’s.\u0026nbspPut them all together, she says, and you may even arrive at “the Roseto effect”. In the early 60s, the inhabitants of Roseto, Pennsylvania, were found to have very low rates of heart disease, for all that they smoked, drank and loved sausages cooked in lard (being overweight is not, statistically, a hindrance to living into old age, provided that your BMI does not stray into serious obesity).The phenomenon was ascribed to the extreme sociability of a community of Italian immigrants who had forgotten all about the Mediterranean diet, but not about the lifestyle that went with it. Were they to abandon their neighbourly habits, a local doctor warned, their health would deteriorate. And so it came to pass. By the end of the 70s, Zaraska writes, Rosetans had succumbed to the American dream of bigger, more remote houses, reached by car rather than on foot – and had a mortality rate similar to other places in the US.Cheeringly, personality traits are not set in stone. They are a compound of faults and behaviours that add up over time, and can be tackled through therapy, meditation and self-discipline – although some are harder to shift than others.\u0026nbsp“If you were to pick one personality trait to work on in order to increase your chances, go for conscientiousness,” she says. As traits go, it is relatively easy to change. “Keep your office neat, organise your sock drawer, set your clothes out the night before.”\u0026nbspAs someone who has always been a bit of a slouch in the sock drawer department, I find this alarming. How does extreme tidiness square with the idea of a harmonious family life –\u0026nbspor of becoming a centenarian?Conscientious people are more likely to do things that are good for them.\u0026nbsp“We invest so much money in expensive clinical trials that promise extravagant therapies to reverse ageing,” she writes. “But maybe we should just do things that are already known to work, such as volunteering, making friends and learning optimism. If we invest more in being kind, mindful and conscientious, we are more likely to improve the conditions in which we all live.”\u0026nbspOffer to mow your neighbour’s lawnHelping other people boosts your sense of wellbeing, and by extension your health, but it is most effective if it is local and involves direct personal contact. If you can combine it with a bit of exercise, bingo.Don’t obsess about organic food and supplementsIt is healthier to make time for a cup of coffee with your partner than to spend hours sourcing and concocting a perfect meal. Plus, according to some studies, the “obesity paradox” means that people with a BMI of between 30 and 35 have a better chance of surviving a range of common diseases than those who are thinner.Work on your friendshipsA happy social life will not only make you feel more optimistic, but will reduce the toxins generated by loneliness. If it has to be via social media for the time being, so be it, but beware of “phubbing” your nearest and dearest – snubbing them in favour of all those phone friends will make them feel lonely and stressed.Attend to your ikigaiIn Japan, which has one of the best longevity records, older people keep themselves busy either with work or with organised hobbies, in the interest of maintaining their ikigai – their purpose in life.\u0026nbspTidy that sock drawerPractise self-discipline in whatever way suits you, whether yoga, meditation or mindfulness. It will help you to be your best self and may even lead to you living until you are 100 – provided\u0026nbspyou don’t get too stressed about it.Growing Young: How Friendship, Optimism, and Kindness Can Help You Live to 100 by Marta Zaraska is published by Robinson.

And could the current health crisis lead to a wellbeing revolution?In January 2018, a Yale University professor named Laurie Santos launched a course, Psychology and the Good Life, which quickly became the most popular class in the institution’s 319-year-history. After 13 years at Yale, in 2016, the 44-year-old had taken charge of one of the university’s residential colleges and had become alarmed by widespread mental illness and stress. She wanted to explain the paradox of why so many students were still suffering, having achieved their dreams of being admitted to Yale and having met society’s definition of success. Santos created the lecture series in a bid to teach her students what really mattered – to help them carve out lives of meaning and contentment.Within a few days of the course’s launch, roughly a quarter of Yale’s entire undergraduate population had signed up. Administrators struggled to find space to accommodate everyone having filled the university’s church, they set up an overflow room for students to watch Santos by screen, before moving her to a large concert hall. Standing behind a lectern on the auditorium’s stage, she questioned much of what the students had been taught to crave: good grades, prestigious jobs, high salaries. With her message that we should step back from ceaseless competition, question our priorities and savour our days, she had clearly tapped into a deep hunger for another way of viewing life.A few months later, in March 2018, Santos launched a 10-week online version of the original happiness course that anyone could access. In the class, called The Science of Well-Being, Santos teaches us why we chase things that make us miserable and, through homework tasks, suggests how we can change our behaviours. She begins with this message: “This is the kind of thing that we really hope can actually change your life.” The course became a major hit half a million online learners enrolled in the two years up to March. But after Covid-19 struck, it became even more popular: more than 2.6m students have now enrolled, from more than 200 countries. At the beginning of the course, Santos issues a warning: “You are about to learn that everything you thought was important for being happy isn’t.”There has been much recent discussion about how the pandemic might fuel political and social changes, about whether or not reduced travel and clearer skies will have increased our desire to protect the environment, or if new government welfare schemes will have popularised universal basic income and a world with less work. But we are also asking questions about the way we live inidually. For all the mental suffering and loss this pandemic has brought, there’s a chance that we could emerge from it with a clearer sense of how we want to spend our days, how we might live happier and more meaningful lives. For many, the question now is: will we be able to make enduring behaviour changes when it ends?Santos has spent this spring inside the Yale college where she lives and works. When we spoke last month, she told me it had been eerily quiet. Graduation had been cancelled and only the few students who couldn’t return to their home countries remained, along with the foxes and squirrels that had descended on to the empty campus. She had recently run a live question and answer session as part of her online course, where people asked her advice on issues ranging from how to deal with annoying spouses to facing job losses. She’d also led webinars for corporates and was making new episodes for her podcast series on happiness.Then there’s the barrage of daily emails her newfound fandom has brought, many of them outlining intense pain and seeking advice. She’d been trying to stay sane through Zoom spa evenings and yoga with her friends, as well as catch-ups with college roommates. “Tragically, I think the pandemic is good for business,” she said.Santos never planned to become a global happiness phenomenon. In fact, she comes across as slightly reserved, not the kind of person who would chase fame. At Yale, her main psychology research involves studying animals to better understand how humans copy each other, draw moral conclusions and make decisions. But as she got to know her students better, her focus began to shift. Some media commentators were dismissing campus mental health problems as the whining of a privileged “snowflake generation”, but Santos was unconvinced by this view. She saw the suffering as symbolic of deeper societal problems.I studied – and taught undergraduates – at Yale before Santos’s course began and saw first-hand how the culture there fuels and embodies many of the modern world’s harmful extremes, such as burnout, overwork and chasing extrinsic recognition. It’s a place where people are high achieving, but also time-starved and stressed-out. Their success, too often, comes at a cost. Underpinning it is an ambition that can be obsessive, unhealthy and, in some cases, lethal – a warped belief that people are valuable only because of their professional potential.What, then, is Santos’s answer to a better life? First, she suggests we’ve been misled in chasing many of the things we do: possessions, beauty, even perhaps marriage. She points to a string of studies to explain her view, including work by Princeton researchers showing that, after a certain point (around $75,000 in the US), money doesn’t increase happiness and emotional wellbeing. She also references papers suggesting that weight loss and cosmetic surgery may not lead to increases in happiness, as well as research showing how salary goals keep rising as we earn more money, which means we may never feel we are making enough. We compare ourselves to others, and therefore will likely continue endlessly wanting more.Becoming aware of all this may not be enough, though. Santos’s own research has pointed out that knowledge plays only a small role in how we make decisions habits and an ability to regulate our emotions have much more influence on happiness. She also says our brains often deceive us, including when we feel strong urges. We may feel we want something – more money, a new coat, cupcakes – though it might not actually bring us much pleasure. And we often don’t crave the simple things we might enjoy more, like relaxing in nature or hanging out with friends. Becoming happier, therefore, routinely requires us to ignore our impulses.“We have these intuitions about happiness that are wrong,” Santos tells me. Our brains aren’t necessarily built to improve our mood. They’re still wired like they were centuries ago, to prioritise escaping predators and immediate threats.As part of her course, Santos prescribes weekly “rewirement challenges”, where she asks students to take a (scientific) leap of faith and commit to new behaviours. These include starting conversations with strangers, getting enough sleep and writing gratitude letters to friends. Another of her challenges is called negative visualisation in which people imagine bad things happening, like family members dying or losing their homes. It seeks to make us more grateful and combat what psychologists call hedonic adaptation, which is the tendency to get used to changes in our lives so that our wants and expectations keep rising. Some of these techniques might sound like wellness caricatures, but Santos insists there’s scientific research to suggest they all work.Is it really possible to increase happiness? Suffering is an inescapable fact of living and no lecture series could hope to solve all human struggles. But Santos does believe we can successfully fight against our negative, destructive tendencies. That’s what we’ve been trying to do for centuries – from Aristotle’s idea that happiness depends on carving out virtuous habits, to the Buddhist notion that controlling craving can reduce suffering. Santos is searching for empirical proof, often from other researchers, that these techniques work and is putting a modern, scientific, spin on them. She’s currently compiling data from students who’ve taken the course. Generally, she says, they do report increases on wellbeing measures at the end.There’s also a debate to be had about the extent to which our happiness is limited by the society we live in. In the last few decades, data suggests attitudes on what we find important have flipped where most American first-year students prioritised developing meaningful life philosophies in the 1960s and were less interested in money, for example, more recently they cited becoming rich as a more important life goal. Santos feels such cultural values are problematic for our wellbeing. Economic disparities, racism and polarisation, she argues, aren’t only responsible for inequalities and persecution, they also fuel mental health problems and go against the happiness research, which suggests that connecting with other people – including those different from ourselves –and helping them is important.Santos remains cautiously hopeful. “There are lots of forces pushing us in the wrong direction,” she says. “There is something broken in our society and I think a lot of people are realising that.”Her next mission is to create a happiness course for high-school students (for which she recently got funding), with modules for parents, to curb child mental health problems and push more structural changes. “I think this might be another thing like climate change, young people fighting for change. Ultimately, it’s going to be their world down the line. If we can teach them the right way to do stuff, maybe they will make societies that are a little bit better.”In the meantime, Santos believes the pandemic can catalyse some of the inidual changes she’s proposing. “It’s an awful crisis and that’s not to belittle it,” she says. “But I think there are blessings in the middle of this.” She bolsters her conviction with research. For instance work by Professor Katherine Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania on how momentous times in our lives can create a fresh-start effect, motivating us to instil new habits, see time differently and take a broader view of our lives. Other research which should give us hope is on post-traumatic growth, the idea that crises can fuel transformations. Following them people often become more resilient, with deeper social connections, greater spirituality and clarity on how to live. In certain senses, they’re often glad for the experiences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67d1fcc9aa7294465501d0f3835eb4dfd5b772c2/0_1065_3183_2540/master/3183.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f1377925bd2a04bc9f4ce10254eae50 1010w","title":"picture a pandemic how guardian photographers adapted to lockdown life","story":"Our photojournalists explain how the pandemic has changed their practice – and why physical distancing is no barrier to producing intimate portraits by  Fiona Shields,  David Levene,  Sarah Lee,  Suki Dhanda and  Jonny WeeksThroughout the pandemic it has been important to show our readers and viewers what’s happening in the world outside, to make a historical document and to chart the progress of those on the frontline. During the first weeks, it was difficult to gain access to hospitals to see how they were coping – until photojournalist Jonny Weeks was invited on to the Covid-19 wards at University hospital in Coventry. We made a full risk assessment, considering his safety and the risk to those around him, and with the guidance of the staff there he produced a brilliant photo essay. He was one of the very first photojournalists to have this kind of access in the UK and it was a key story for the .Photographing people through windows, in outside\u0026nbspspaces or from the end of their front path has become an accepted feature of this time, like physically distanced queuing\u0026nbspat the supermarket.\u0026nbspIt’s remarkable how inappropriate photo-stories made before the pandemic\u0026nbspnow feel. Seeing people in crowded places such as music festivals, or people going to work – a time before face masks – has quickly become dated.\u0026nbspLike our vocabulary, our visual language and practice has changed, for now.\u0026nbspWe’d all seen images of lockdowns in Italy and Spain and so had a good sense of what was to come. It was clear that the streets of London would fall empty and silent that first morning of lockdown on 24 March. In normal times I would have tried to find high positions to shoot down from but I knew that would be impossible. So I bought a giant monopod online, which thankfully arrived on the 23rd. The thing goes as high as a house with the camera popped on top, which I control using a smartphone down below. So I spent the first few days of lockdown wandering around with it flung over my shoulder, able to shoot desolate London scenes from above within moments from any position. The light was incredible during those first days and weeks, which only increased the sense of urgency to be out there shooting as much as possible. It felt like we were witnessing something unique in our history, which demanded thorough documentation. The days were long and I found it impossible to relax. Even when I got home I felt like I should be back out there photographing. I’d watch the skies from my garden and felt pangs of regret if I saw dramatic clouds developing, sure in the knowledge that I was missing some momentous, empty London streetscape.I went into an early lockdown because my partner is shielding. But you can’t “work from home” as a photographer, so I started taking long walks around my home district, Camden. I’ve lived in this part of London for over 15 years, but having all this sudden time to walk and think and really look in a way I’ve never done before gave me a new perspective. I noticed light, details, and stark beauty in places I’d never seen carefully before. It was strange to do this work and to feel people were only distant, fleeting presences on the periphery of my attention. But that’s how the early weeks of lockdown felt.I’ve worked for the  and Observer for 20 years now, but I also do commercial work – one of my last big jobs before locking down was a Transport for London campaign that is currently decorating a transport network I can’t use – and personal work. I’m the sort of photographer who always carried my Leica with me and usually I don’t see the distinction between paid commissions and my own work. Photography feels like a vocation as well as a career.Fears about the virus meant that for those first two months I didn’t take my camera with me when I went on my rather limited walks. It felt like a possible mode of infection an object I constantly touch and then bring to my face. It’s the longest I’ve gone in my adult life without my camera and without photography. It’s been very painful and difficult.Also I desperately missed, and continue to miss, the human side of my job. I enjoy the huge privilege of meeting so many disparate people and having the unique, brief insights into their worlds that being a photographer usually brings on a daily basis. I realise now more than I ever have before how these daily encounters give meaning to my life and also provide all the sparks that fire both my creative energy and my personal energy. Without that, life is flatter.I did quite quickly realise that I had to continue taking photographs even if I wasn’t working and wasn’t able to use my “proper” camera. I did a series taken on my long walks round Camden.As the rules have loosened a little and I’ve grown braver on my bike, I’ve visited friends outside their homes or in their gardens, and for the past few weeks I’ve returned to my proper Leica. My work is always about intimacy and connection, and as I’ve gradually started to take photos with people in them again, I’m glad to see that side of my creative personality coming back.Going forward, though, I am extremely apprehensive. Photography is a competitive, anxious profession to be in at the best of times. But at the moment I feel I’m trapped inside an airless glass box, where on the outside there are signs of the world coming back to life tentatively and old connections being renewed. I worry I’ll have my nose pressed to the glass till we are safe with a vaccine.My biggest challenge, apart from keeping my four-year-old entertained, was getting my parents repatriated from India, which we eventually managed to do. Both are thankfully safe and well.After a couple of weeks of lockdown work was very quiet, I was getting itchy feet and was desperate to take pictures. We were encouraged to think of stories to photograph safely that we could contribute to the paper. I decided to go to Slough, where I grew up, and photograph the local Asian volunteers who were helping the wider community. I would follow the volunteers in my own car and take pictures of the vulnerable people receiving the donations – all photographed at a safe distance. The volunteers felt very valued when they appeared in the national newspaper and even more so online, viewed by an international audience.Before the lockdown I would mostly shoot in studios with lights and a crew of assistants – makeup artists, PRs and so on. Since lockdown, I have been working solo and most of the portraits have been shot outside. I have sometimes set up a mini-studio with a background in people’s gardens: luckily we had pretty good weather. I must say I have actually enjoyed working this way, keeping things as simple as possible, just me and the subject.In the early days of lockdown, I was frustrated by the lack of coverage from within UK hospitals. Compared with what we were seeing and reading from Italy and the US, we knew very little of our own NHS. For me at least, this meant I had very little concept of the everyday acts of heroism being performed by NHS staff and I really didn’t have much of a clue what I was clapping for during “clap for carers” on Thursday evenings. I felt detached. I approached University hospital in Coventry, where I was born, and was lucky to be granted exclusive access to cover every\u0026nbspaspect of their amazing work.In doing so I was able to document many members of staff and their personal contributions – nurses and doctors in ITU, cleaners and charity workers on the wards. It was a huge undertaking and, given the number\u0026nbspof deaths and the lack of access for family members, a story that had to be handled very sensitively. It was also a challenging assignment because I felt a weight of responsibility to my subjects and I was shooting in conditions that were frankly alien to me (trying to take documentary photographs while wearing PPE is not easy). Fortunately, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive: people valued the unique insight the story provided, they were comforted by the many positive stories that emerged from the tragedy of the pandemic, and they recognised that we had fulfilled our duty to our readers as a newspaper. It showed me that honest, respectful journalism can be immensely powerful. And I was quite chuffed at getting five pages of my work in the paper, too!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376cf020c511f454f2da76ec8813ee7e000d1a30/0_157_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e84bc50854ea7323675ab8ca1f524b31","title":"rolling blackouts coastal fever interview sideways to new italy","story":"The Australian indie-rockers have a new album inspired by life on tour to follow their breakout debut triumph – but coronavirus has put them in limbo‘It was like the tightening of a vice,” says Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever’s Fran Keaney, of the encroaching lockdown measures that have put his band’s touring adventures on ice. When the Australian government’s ban on gatherings of more than 500 people meant RBCF’s show with Pixies at the Sydney Opera House in March was abruptly cancelled, they played a tiny show of their own in Sydney. “But somehow 700 people turned up,” the singer and guitarist says. “It had a strange ‘last show on Earth’ vibe – it felt really wrong. And then everything stopped. I went from worrying that Covid-19 might complicate our UK tour to wondering if I’m allowed to visit my girlfriend down the road.”It’s perhaps an inopportune moment, then, for the Australian five-piece –\u0026nbspone of the biggest breakthrough indie bands of recent years – to be releasing their second album, Sideways to New Italy. “But we’re doing it anyway, even though it’s against conventional wisdom to put it out when we can’t tour,” says a defiant Keaney, via a video call with bandmate Joe White from their Melbourne homes. “Music feels really good to us all right now, trapped in our homes. And some of the songs are determinedly hopeful, so it’s something positive to put out there.”Still, frustrations linger. Their latest video was shot while they were touring Italy last year. “Just the idea of being outside Australia now is so grand,” Keaney sighs. “The world seems so much bigger right now.”The world doubtless seemed similarly vast when a 12-year-old Keaney began playing acoustic guitar with his schoolfriend Tom Russo, trying to master Oasis, Libertines and Pink Floyd songs. Over the years, Keaney’s singerguitarist cousin White, Russo’s bass-playing brother Joe and drumming housemate Marcel Tussie joined the fold, and the nascent group rehearsed weekly in an empty room above the Russo brothers’ dad’s law firm.“Tuesday rehearsals were always the most exciting night of the week,” says White of the sessions on Sydney Road, a bustling strip at the heart of Melbourne’s music scene. “It meant so much to have our own space, where we could just come in, strap our gear on and get started. You could look out the windows and watch the world go by as you played.”It was in these rehearsals that their sound evolved away from classic rock and Britpop to an amiable tangle of indie-rock influences, evoking the savvy glide of Television, the scuffed tunefulness of late-era Pavement and, clearest of all, the bittersweet guitar-pop of the Go-Betweens. This last reference point is a slight bone of contention. “On this album we tried to sound a little less like the Go-Betweens,” says White, “because we’ve been compared to them in every bit of press we get. Maybe it’s the Australian drawl. They had this real honesty to their music that drew you in, that made you feel like they were talking to just you.”“They’re my favourite band,” adds Keaney. “It’s humbling to be compared to them. But I don’t really know what we can do. If you look like someone, you look like someone! I remember, the first time I heard the Go-Betweens, I thought, ‘Wow, that Robert Forster guy really sounds like Tom …’”Two early EPs helped spread their lilting, literate pop across the internet, where they were discovered by the legendary Seattle-based label, Sub Pop. Their debut full-length, Hope Downs, drew widespread acclaim but few critics noticed the darkness underpinning its heady, insightful tunefulness, reflecting the traumatic year it was written, 2016, with the deaths of David Bowie and Prince, and the election of Trump. “People think our songs as really sunny, driving-to-the-coast-with-your-elbows-in-the-breeze music,” says Keaney. “But Hope Downs is all about claustrophobia and bewilderment.”“The album’s named after this huge mine in Western Australia, this massive hole in the ground,” says White. “And 2016 was this year where you felt like you were standing on the edge of this great abyss wondering, ‘What next? Where are we going?’”The loose thread running through Sideways to New Italy, meanwhile, is “home” – an elusive concept for young men who spent much of the last two years touring the world. “All our stuff was in boxes, our relationships back home fell apart,” says Keaney. “I found myself trying to write myself out of a weird spot.”“We were trying to write about what we loved, and how it’s a bit weird when you’re away so much,” says White of an effervescent, romantic and bittersweet album. “We weren’t writing a ‘Woe is us, we have to go on tour’ type of record. We know that sort of record. We hate that sort of record.”Now, of course, the group couldn’t go on tour if they wanted to – and they do. But they’re trying to remain characteristically positive. “Holding off from playing shows – it’s like pulling back the bow, stretching the rubber band,” says White. “When we finally get to play it’ll be really exciting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ddddb8898be847e0fd5b8dd319e8b2f1b85bbb/0_45_5349_3209/master/5349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd8741bca90f87bdacd0969389bee51e","title":"sports team deep down happy review debut album","story":"(Island)This six-piece band marry Britpop sensibilities with a US alt-rock soundWith an eloquence you’d hope for from a band made up of Cambridge graduates and an old-school penchant for slagging off their indie peers, London-based six-piece Sports Team have long given good interview. Pleasingly, their debut album suggests there’s enough musical substance to back up their fighting talk. Sharply observational lyrics skewering the mores of suburbia and middle England inevitably evoke the less boorish end of the Britpop spectrum. But where the Pulp and Blur of that era always sounded quintessentially British, Deep Down Happy more often takes its musical cues from US alt-rock, most notably the off-kilter melodies of Pavement and the boisterousness of Parquet Courts.Opener Lander sets the tone, Rob Knaggs’s ever-shifting guitar lines supporting frontman Alex Rice’s Sprechgesang stream-of-consciousness (“I wanna be a lawyer Or someone who hunts foxes”). Going Soft, meanwhile, struts like Franz Ferdinand in their mid-00s pomp, while Fishing just sounds uncomplicatedly joyful. They don’t manage to sustain the invention throughout the 12 songs: The portrait of an opinionated older man in The Races relies too heavily on stereotype and comes across like the final iteration in a series of progressively worse photocopies of Blur’s Charmless Man.

She added that the government’s treatment of staff was “outrageous”.DfID, formed in 1997 – although incarnations have existed under previous governments – employs about 3,600 staff working in offices in London and East Kilbride, as well as around the world. Plans for the new department, to be called the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and due to be set up by September, have been criticised by three former prime ministers.One DfID employee, whose identity the  is protecting, said: “I feel like the majority of staff have a mix of emotions on the merger – devastated, demoralised, angry, anxious. You could just pick a negative emotion and I’ve felt it at some point since we heard the news.“It’s been a long-held goal for the Conservative party, and Boris Johnson in particular, to merge the departments, so it wasn’t a complete bolt from the blue. But nobody expected it would come so quickly. As civil servants, we felt we should have been told first, but we found out through leaks to the media before the prime minister’s statement to the House of Commons. It just shows the contempt they have for DfID.“This is about the prime minister using the pandemic to achieve a long-term goal and making a snap announcement about it and not even giving staff the opportunity to react.”Another DfID employee said: “Like most people at DfID, I’m really passionate about my job and I’m still reeling at the news of the merger. There’s been murmurings about it, the signs were there, but no one thought it would happen now as we’re in the midst of the pandemic. We’re all sitting at home struggling with dealing with the ramifications of this. It’s pulled the rug away from everyone’s feet.“There’s a tide of confusion, disbelief and uncertainty among staff. Are their jobs safe? How is this going to work? How long is it going to take? They’re saying it’ll be done by September but that’s 11 weeks away, and the government doesn’t move quick. Then there’s the question of whether this is a merger or a Foreign Office takeover. Are we being subsumed? We’re angry and upset. There have been a lot of tears.“I think the government has been opportunistic with its timing on the merger announcement. They seem to be using the crisis so that this goes under the radar. It’s a politicised move, and about cuts as well.”Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), said: “The testimony people in DfID have given is a damning indictment of the decision to merge the department with FCO … Boris Johnson’s slash-and-burn approach to international aid not only threatens the livelihoods of our members in DfID and FCO but will significantly damage our relations with other countries at a time when we need all the friends we can muster.”Allan Sampson, the national officer at FDA – which represents senior civil servants – said: “Members in DfID were shocked and angered by the announcement, made worse by the fact they initially found out about it through the media. Their immediate fear is for the number of jobs available within the new department, but concern also exists regarding the nature of the new work.”Champion said: “DfID staff do the job because they believe in the work, it’s more than a job for them – it’s a moral drive to try and alleviate poverty. To have the government use the department as a pawn in this way and staff treated with so little respect or compassion, is outrageous. It shows a level of a callousness that I would never expect of a UK government. I’m not fundamentally against a merger, I just haven’t seen any evidence that shows it’s the right way forward.”A government spokesman said DfID staff “can take pride” in their work, saying their “ambition, vision and expertise will be at the heart of the new department”, which will “bring together our international effort and maximise the influence and impact of our world-leading development and foreign policy experts”.They added: “The merger will mean adjustments in how teams are structured in the new department, and some roles and responsibilities across both DfID and FCO will change. But there will be no compulsory redundancies, and we will work closely with staff throughout the process of implementing the merger – including through the unions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/188cd9b5a7066acc76e5c21d8f9cc687b2ce1881/0_498_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=524489d9ac84c0f4ecc8d9fb31a0d851","title":"human genome project unlocking dna covid 19 cystic fibrosis molecular scientists","story":"Thanks to the success of the Human Genome Project, 20 years ago this week, scientists can track biology and disease at a molecular level Twenty years ago this week, an international group of scientists announced it had put together the first genetic blueprint of a human being. After 10 years of effort, the team – made up of thousands of scientists working on both sides of the Atlantic – revealed it had pinpointed all 3bn units of DNA that make up the human genome.The result was “the most wondrous map ever created by humankind”, US President Bill Clinton told a special White House ceremony to mark the event. A parallel event, hosted by Tony Blair in Downing Street, also featured glittering praise for the effort.The $2.7bn (£2.2bn) Human Genome Project remains one of science’s greatest feats of investigation. It was described, at the time, as biology’s answer to the Apollo space programme. It took researchers on a very different journey – not of outward exploration, but an inward voyage: a mission to unravel the molecular essence of humanity.Armed with the resulting “wondrous map”, scientists would soon, it was assumed, isolate the genes for height, eye colour, intelligence and myriad other human attributes. However, this simple goal has been confounded by the fact that a great many inidual human attributes are determined by dozens, if not hundreds of genes. We are too complex for reductionism.Nevertheless, the biological revolution let loose on 25 June 2000 has had remarkable results. The draft genome published that day was later followed up with more and more accurate “maps” of our DNA until the project was officially closed in 2003 with publication of a final, full human genome. Ever since, gene sequence studies set up in the project’s wake have been involved in growing numbers of remarkable discoveries.For example, DNA studies have shown our species once mated with Neanderthals while other projects have pinpointed mutated genes that cause cancers and melanomas. Others have helped to develop new drugs for conditions ranging from cystic fibrosis to asthma.These successes have been achieved because gene sequencing, over the decades, has become a highly automated and incredibly cheap process. “It took a decade of intense effort to create that first rough draft of a human genome,” said Cordelia Langford, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, near Cambridge, where UK scientists played a prime role in Britain’s involvement in the Human Genome Project. “Today, we sequence around 3,000 full genomes a week. It has become a simple, straightforward process.”Not all these genomes belong to humans. Some belong to other animals and others to our mortal enemies – such as the organisms responsible for malaria and cholera, a list of foes that has now been expanded to include Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Sequencing its tiny genome is now providing doctors and public authorities with critically important information about the disease.“We are sequencing samples of Sars-Cov-2 from different sources to see if the virus is mutating significantly,” said Dominic Kwiatkowski, director of the Centre for Genomics and Global Health at Oxford university. “The jury is still out on that. However, we are also using sequencing technology to highlight tiny variations in samples from different places, and that should help us pinpoint the locations of new outbreaks.”A very different use of sequencing technology is being pursued by Sarah Teichmann, leader of the Human Cell Atlas project. “Devices are now so sensitive that we can analyse DNA from a single cell and at the same time compare our findings with DNA from millions of other comparable cells,” she said.That data tells researchers what the cells in our bodies are doing at a very high resolution and at a specific time, information that has led to the discovery of many new types of cells, many in the immune system and others in the body’s various tissues.“This work has triggered a major revolution in understanding our bodies’ cells and their organisation in tissue and organs,” said Teichmann, who is also based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “By comparing healthy tissue with diseased tissue in this way, we are getting incredible new insights into the mechanisms of those diseases. This is a very powerful technique.”Such insights have included pinpointing cells involved in the development of cystic fibrosis, asthma and certain human tumours. The discoveries have opened up the prospect of developing therapies for these conditions.The Human Genome Project is clearly having a big impact on medicine and research, but its progress was not without controversy during the course of its work, which began in 1990. “We were in a race. It was as simple as that,” said Langford, who is now the Sanger’s director of science operation but who worked as a research assistant during the project’s early days. “We were out to stop people from putting patents on human DNA that was being sequenced elsewhere.”At the time, a rival outfit to the Human Genome Project – known as Celera – had been set up with the maverick researcher Craig Venter as its head. “They wanted to put patents on the DNA they were uncovering. We wanted to make sure everyone could use the data and were putting every sequence we found into the public domain to block any attempt to privatise the genome. And in the end we succeeded.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f130230f97b8c67dc1ccc92dc80d3599a965f92/0_61_6587_3955/master/6587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13cef3511f20bab03b4cee6e41364599","title":"things vanish off the edge barnsley counts the cost of a decade of austerity","story":"The borough council has lost a third of its budget and the results are plain to seeNow, on the site of the former Houghton main colliery three miles down the road, there is a vast distribution centre run by the online fashion giant Asos.Thurnscoe also highlights another modern British story: that of austerity, and the 10 years that have passed since the then chancellor George Osborne stood in House of the Commons, flanked by the Lib Dem coalition ministers Danny Alexander and Nick Clegg, and outlined a drastic emergency budget.It was 22 June 2010.

Hacked-down public transport makes things more difficult, and people’s environment can feel neglected and unkempt. It is difficult to talk about concepts such as aspiration when things feel so fragile and contingent.But there is also a story about strong community spirit. Volunteers muck in with street cleaning, grass cutting and the maintenance of local parks. The council talks about how much of what it does is now localised, and based more on partnership with people than the idea of services being provided from high. None of this detracts from the gravity of austerity – any mention of David Cameron’s notion of the “big society” is met with derision – but it highlights the fact that the places that have suffered the worst effects of dire cuts are not the hopeless social wastelands of some people’s imagination.A good example of renewed local endeavour in Thurnscoe is the Station House Community Association. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, it ran playgroups, after-school childcare and holiday provision from 9am until 6pm. At the moment, seven of its eight employees have been furloughed. The only member of staff still at work is its chief executive, Charlotte Williams, a borough resident for 27 years, who makes sure she speaks to the dozens of families on her books at least once a week.The first thing she talks about is cuts to local bus services and how difficult they make life for shift workers, before she turns to Thurnscoe’s former Sure Start children’s centre. “It used to be open long hours, and you could access a whole range of services,” she says. “But it’s no longer a place where you can get childcare that would allow you to go to work. They used to have a load of outreach programmes, stay-and-play sessions and baby massage and all that. Some of that still exists, but there’s far less of it, and it tends to be much more targeted now.“Before the cuts, anyone could go in and access those things. Now it’s more like if you tick a certain amount of boxes, you’ll start getting some input. It’s almost like ‘We’re waiting for you to fail, and then we’ll try and build you back up.’ Before, you could get the help you needed when you needed it. Everything feels very wobbly. That causes a nervousness in communities.”There is a bitter irony to Barnsley’s recent political history. At the 2019 election, the Conservatives won Penistone and Stocksbridge, a seat partly inside the borough, from Labour. In the constituency of Barnsley Central, Labour’s Dan Jarvis, who is now also the mayor of the Sheffield city region, watched as his share of the vote fell by 23 percentage points, largely thanks to Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. Barnsley nonetheless remains a place with a strong historical connection to the Labour, and the party has run the borough council since its creation in 1973.The leader of Barnsley council for 24 years has been Stephen Houghton. He places what has happened to Barnsley in the context of other historical events, not least the miners’ strike of 1984-5. The headquarters of what remains of the National Union of Mineworkers is in Barnsley. The home of Arthur Scargill, who led the strike to defeat, is just down the road. When the NUM was beaten, it opened the way for deep changes to society and the state. These arguably reached their peak in the coalition years when, Houghton says, austerity “wasn’t just about numbers. It was philosophical. ‘The state is too big.’”He and his colleagues began planning for cuts in 2008. “We could see the writing on the wall because of the scale of the crash, and the government bailout. I think everybody thought we were likely to get a Tory government, which would be even harder. It didn’t become just about making cuts to balance the books. We said, ‘The way we do things has got to have a complete rethink.’”The council now does a lot of its work through six “area councils” that administer services with a more local focus, and 21 “ward alliances” that coordinate such services as the cleaning of parks and streets with the aid of local volunteers. “In the past we’d been like most Labour councils,” Houghton says. “Very paternalistic, ‘We’re here to look after you.’ Suddenly our job became about helping you to look after yourselves.”Council-run children’s centres have, to use the official vernacular, been “reconfigured”. Nineteen once offered a full range of services, but now only six do. “We still provide a service, but it isn’t what it used to be. And these are deprived communities that really need that early years help. It’s the poorest kids who lose out, isn’t it?”Youth work goes on partly via voluntary groups, but all the borough’s council-owned centres have closed. Street cleaning, highway maintenance and parks budgets have all been substantially reduced.All but two of Barnsley’s libraries have stayed open, but many run on reduced hours and the mobile service has been axed. Council tax has been repeatedly put up, and the council’s workforce has been reduced from around 4,500 to 2,300.“Just a general lowering of service provision is hard,” says Houghton. “The place starts to look tired and decayed. Psychologically, the general population gets into a place where it’s like, ‘Nothing good ever happens and there isn’t much future.’ That isn’t how you’re going to change the nature of communities and move them on.”Just before the Covid-19 outbreak, the council was developing new spending plans. “For example, there are some areas in children’s services we were going to improve, around early years. That’ll probably have to stop,” says Houghton. “What Covid means is, we’re back to austerity again.”He and his colleagues now face an in-year financial gap of £23m. “But we worry more about 2021-22 than we do about this year. You’ve got to plug that gap, or we’re going to start cutting again. I think the government will come up with some money, but I don’t think they’ll fully cover it.”“How do you get people into jobs?” Houghton asks. “You can pay them more and encourage them. Or you can cut their benefits and drive them into work, but they’ll still be in poverty.”In Royston, just to the north of the town centre, Nichola Smith is the headteacher of Meadstead primary school, one of nearly 60 schools across England run by the Academies Enterprise Trust. Her school seems to have avoided the financial squeeze that has recently affected swathes of education, but she says money remains very tight. “Sometimes we can only do what we can do with what we’ve got, and I’ve got quite unique staff who are good at making something out of nothing.”The school has an across-the-board breakfast programme funded by outside donors, who are also involved in providing other help for families in precarious circumstances: grants for those unable to afford fridges or washing machines, assistance with buying school uniforms and food parcels.“The parents who were just about managing are now not managing, because universal credit’s not the same as the benefits they were getting before. That’s the biggest thing that’s hit my families,” Smith says.Such stories seem impossibly bleak, but conversations about Barnsley also include descriptions of a place that has started to recover some of its confidence, even in the hardest of times. A new town centre “community hub” and library called the Lightbox opened last year. A lot of people also talk about Experience Barnsley, a new museum and “discovery centre” that opened in 2013 just as the cuts were reaching their nadir.Run by the council and housed in the town hall, its collection is based on objects and stories supplied by the people of Barnsley themselves. Most of its £4m starting costs came from the heritage lottery fund and the EU.The poet and broadcaster Ian McMillan, who was born in Barnsley and lives four miles from the town centre, currently serves as the museum’s “poet in lockdown”. This entails writing a sonnet every Thursday, which is then posted on social media. “At the time, you thought, ‘Here’s a place where things are shutting down everywhere, and a museum is actually opening,’” he says. “It felt counterintuitive, like swimming against some kind of tide.”Nonetheless, his experience of his home town over the last decade has been coloured by the sadness that austerity brought. “You notice things kind of vanishing off the edge,” he says. ‘Where did that go, that community centre?’ Things disappear, and that becomes the norm. You notice weeds, and grass not being cut so often. It’s like mood music, but all in a minor key.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cad44c469fd3ee466f2bf245836d7917ac699baf/0_75_4708_2824/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4b773bd4c572c5ceb407f34557ff96a","title":"uk reports rise in over 50s struggling to pay for necessities","story":"Surge in universal credit claims highlights precarious financial situation of demographicIncreasing numbers of people aged over 50 in the UK do not have enough money to pay for basic necessities, a study of labour market statistics has shown.Claims for universal credit, which is available only to households with savings of less than £16,000, from the over-50s have more than doubled since March.The research, commissioned by Rest Less, a website for the over-50s, came after Ipsos Mori found the coronavirus crisis could leave the next generation of retirees significantly poorer and sicker.Stuart Lewis, the founder of Rest Less, said: “Sadly, this is only the tip of the iceberg as many of those unemployed in their 50s will not be eligible to claim universal credit. The surge in older claimants highlights the extremely precarious financial situation that many of this demographic find themselves in today.“With birth rates having declined for decades, the over-50s have been the main driving force behind the success story of UK employment growth in the years leading up to the pandemic,” he added. “Crucially, they will need to be just as essential to any recovery of the economy on the other side.”Sue Burton Ross, 66, does not qualify for universal credit even though she is struggling financially. Burton Ross was made redundant from her role as a business support manager in the care sector at the end of February.Burton Ross has applied for more than 200 jobs and has had 12 interviews. She believes her age is the key reason why she has not been selected for many of these roles. “My mental, physical and financial wellbeing have suffered as a result of jobhunting during the pandemic,” she said. “I cannot access universal credit because I have just started taking my state pension, even though it doesn’t cover my bills.”Before the pandemic, over-50s were already more likely to be in long-term unemployment than their younger counterparts, while analysis of insolvency data found an alarming increase in female insolvencies over the age of 65.Lewis said: “In a year when the state pension age increases to 66 and with more over-50s claiming universal credit than those under 25, this is a wakeup call for government policy. The fear is of a lost generation of highly talented, older workers forced permanently into a miserable and unaffordable early retirement.”Kim Chaplain, the associate director at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: “These figures are really worrying. Without action, we risk seeing many in their 50s and 60s fall out of the workforce years before the state pension age.”Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “Post-pandemic, the government needs to make sure that job centres and other back-to-work support offers have the skills and expertise needed to address the specific barriers faced by older people.“Otherwise those in their late 50s and 60s may end up having to claim universal credit or draw down savings, which they had worked hard to put by, with the aim of providing them with a decent retirement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf5bdcb9d25134da46903e61fdbaed8bac786c14/41_0_3419_2052/master/3419.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7ef2cf728df5cf13fbe953fda8abcb05","title":"grigor dimitrov so sorry after testing positive for coronavirus","story":"Grigor Dimitrov says he is “sorry for any harm I might have caused” after revealing he has tested positive for coronavirus.The Bulgarian announced his positive test on Instagram just moments before world No 1 Novak Djokovic was due to face Andrey Rublev in the final of the Adria Tour exhibition series in Croatia, leading to the swift cancellation of the event in Zadar as the crowd awaited their arrival.“I want to reach out and let my fans and friends know that I tested positive back in Monaco for Covid-19,” Dimitrov wrote on Instagram. “I want to make sure anyone who has been in contact with me during these past days gets tested and takes the necessary precautions.“I am so sorry for any harm I might have caused. I am back home now and recovering. Thanks for your support and please stay safe and healthy.”Numerous top tennis players have flown out to the Balkans for the tour organised by Djokovic in lieu of the cancelled ATP and WTA sanctioned events. The opening leg in Belgrade last week had already received criticism after being held in front of hulking crowds in accordance with Serbia’s relaxed restrictions. Throughout the weekend, Djokovic, Dimitrov, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and other players were pictured hugging, shaking hands and dancing together at a club.Djokovic addressed the disapproval to the Eurosport Tennis Legends podcast. “I know there have been some criticisms as well especially coming from the West: ‘why do we have a crowd? Why not having social distancing?” he said.Over the weekend in Zadar, Dimitrov took part in activities that placed him in close proximity with his colleagues and fans, such as a basketball game and a media event amid large crowds in the centre of Zadar. On Saturday afternoon, he looked severely off the pace during his emphatic 4-1, 4-1 loss to Borna Coric. “At all times we have strictly followed the epidemiological measures in place with the countries where the Adria Tour was organised. None of the people involved in the organisation and who have been in contact with Grigor have any symptoms,” read a statement from the Adria Tour.The news comes days after the US Open confirmed its spot on the 2020 calendar with around 300 players due to travel to New York. US Open tournament director Stacey Allaster described their cooperation as a “leap of faith”, stressing the importance of sound decision making from players to avoid contracting the virus.However, numerous top players have already shown some disregard for the pandemic by traveling fairly frequently over the past few months. Dimitrov spent the initial quarantine period in the United States and has since passed through Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia and Monaco. Meanwhile, Thiem travelled back to Vienna, Austria before flying to France for the Ultimate Tennis Showdown and he is slated to compete in Berlin and then Kitzbuhel, Austria again.

I am as yet physically unscathed. Merely topsy-turvy.\u0026nbspLockdown made me see the point of Salvador Dalí’s melted clocks. I am in the same room as I was before the theatres went dark. Yet without the night job, boundaries quickly went woozy, with a disconcerting mixture of torpor and intensity. No theatre means no weekly deadlines and no limit to each day. No changing into\u0026nbspcritic’s clothes at 5pm, no setting off to work as my neighbours return home. It means not seeing those critical versions of office and colleagues: foyers and theatre bars and the well-known backs of reviewing necks. It means no automatic shift of gear in the evening: no being snatched away into a playwright’s mind no being taken into a different space by a designer. It is as if part of the dreamscape had been stolen.At the same time, daily life has taken on a theatrical aspect. Its range has shrunk but it is often lit luridly, by flares of alarms and political rage.\u0026nbspThe rearrangements have been like those of someone preparing a dinky but desolate one-person show. New costumes: masks and gloves. New props: hand sanitisers. New expressions: eye-work above the masks. New choreography: snaking around the rest of the cast on pavements. And a new emphasis on sound design. Not only do I hear more – blackbirds’ melodious bellowing, neighbours’ arguments – without the muffle of traffic and planes. The last time I spent so much time on the phone I was a teenager whispering into the family apparatus in the hall.Plays have not disappeared. They are everywhere – apart from on the stage.\u0026nbspTransmuted. The ingenuity of companies and iniduals has been astonishing. Podcasts from The Lockdown Plays of new work\u0026nbspby, among others, Caryl Churchill and Simon Stephens. The entire cycle of Shakespeare’s sonnets read, under the auspices of London’s Jermyn Street theatre,\u0026nbspby established actors – among them,\u0026nbspOlivia Colman and Penelope Wilton –\u0026nbspand final-year drama students. The Royal Court is challenging audiences to make their own videos based on single lines from plays performed at the theatre. At last, radio drama is getting a boost: not least through actor Bertie Carvel’s initiative in taking productions whose runs were cut short by Covid-19 to BBC Radio 3 and 4 with his Lockdown Theatre festival. Meanwhile, the National Theatre, which has streamed a terrific, varied menu, from One Man, Two Guvnors to Barber Shop Chronicles, has become truly nationwide, barriers of price and place dissolved. As has the National Theatre of Scotland. \u0026nbspStreaming and recording has been a gigantic ad for theatre writing, acting and directing. But it’s a skeleton of the thing itself.\u0026nbspWork on stage happens in the present, at a particular moment: it can’t, any more than life, be rewound or fast-forwarded.\u0026nbspThe director Richard Eyre, who in March had two shows running in the West End, puts it pungently: “Live theatre is at war with lockdown.”\u0026nbspNot least because an essential “chemical ingredient” for actors and audiences is physical closeness. The very element that defines it makes it hard to get going again.Theatre can help fund hospital beds: last year it brought in £133m in VAT in London alone.\u0026nbspLast week a letter to the Treasury from nearly 100 of this year’s Olivier and other award nominees – among them Sharon D Clarke, Andrew Scott and Tom Stoppard – called on the government urgently to consider the plans for support outlined by UK TheatreSociety of London Theatres, which included the proposal that the government become a “theatrical angel”, investing in shows and sharing in the profits. In the Financial Times, director Sam Mendes drew attention to another source of revenue. Streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix have been made rich – richer – by drawing on acting, writing and directorial talent during the pandemic: they could now help sustain that money-starved talent.Paradoxically, the buttoned-up Brits are celebrated abroad for their dramatic gifts: the theatre brings us visitors. In its particular ability to take us into and lift us out of ourselves, it can also help us imagine a new future.\u0026nbspWhat will the post-pandemic theatre be like? It cannot be as white – on stage and backstage – as it has been allowed to be. This was changing slowly before the coronavirus, and change will surely – must – accelerate after the 2020 anti-racism protests. It may be, as Kathy Burke predicted last month on Radio 4’s Saturday Live, that there will be a resurgence of urgent fringe work. Richard Eyre agrees. “Those of us who remember the 70s remember that is exactly what happened. Theatres like the Oval House and Soho and Battersea Arts Centre were started by people who didn’t have subsidy and resources, but wanted to express themselves.”Meanwhile, an under-reported aspect of theatre continues. It’s exemplified by James Brining and Robert Hastie, artistic directors of Leeds Playhouse and\u0026nbspSheffield Theatres, who run stages that put on big, buoyant shows and which also have a clear civic function. Both, having successfully reduced their public subsidy, are now in dire straits: it costs tens of thousands of pounds a week to keep a theatre closed.\u0026nbspBoth men have plans for the summer, with Brining constructing links across the city with other arts organisations, including Opera North, and Hastie negotiating with Sheffield council to stage quick-moving (an hour-and-a-half straight through), open-air Shakespeare.Both are continuing online the work that, like most not-for-profit theatres, they do routinely: with groups of refugees, the elderly and schools. This might be seen as social work. But it’s a particular kind: concerned, as Brining puts it, with helping people “to see themselves – and to see themselves differently”. That is something theatre can do while being explosively entertaining: as one of Sheffield’s great successes, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, has proved. It can also, as Eyre points out, offer something else crucially needed now.\u0026nbsp“You go in as iniduals and, if it works, at the end you become a group, a society.” Isolation unlocked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed5c28f29f28555cf05ba7f36ae00d5c044a489/0_39_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0756dc95f25cc57e6772f684636153ed","title":"microsoft presidents criticism of app stores puts pressure on apple","story":"Microsoft has thrown its weight behind calls for an antitrust investigation into App Store monopolies, piling yet more pressure on Apple as the iPhone maker prepares for its annual developer conference on Monday.Smith’s comments, which did not mention Apple by name, add to a growing backlash against the company’s methods of monetising its position as the sole gatekeeper of what can be installed on iPhones and iPads around the world.There are exceptions for “reader” apps, such as Netflix and Kindle, which may offer access to digital content bought on other platforms. But even there, Apple imposes strict limits: companies may not actively tell users where to go to pay, nor even let them know about the existence of other payment methods.Apple has long maintained that the rules are required to protect users from fraud and scams. But on Tuesday, the European Commission announced an investigation into whether the company was acting in an anticompetitive fashion. “It appears that Apple obtained a ‘gatekeeper’ role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple’s popular devices,” said Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner. “We need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition.”The EU’s investigation had been prompted by complaints from Spotify and by an unnamed “e-bookaudiobook distributor”, thought to be Japanese conglomerate Rakuten. Apple has said that the claims are “baseless”.Just a day later, more complaints emerged on the other side of the Atlantic, prompted by Apple’s refusal to approve a bold competitor to Gmail, called Hey. The service, which comes with a $99 (£79) annual price tag, launched on the App Store without any in-app purchases, and required users to sign up online. But a week after its release, Apple refused to approve an update, and said it was a mistake to have let the app be published at all.“We’ve been a software developer for 20 years,” said David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Hey’s developer, Basecamp. “We thought we knew all the written and unwritten rules, but then we, with all this knowledge, have invested two years and millions of dollars into developing a new email service, can face this sort of retaliation – or perhaps just be a victim of their capricious policies. If they kick you out of the App Store, it’s like you don’t exist.”Hansson believes that Apple quietly changed some of those unwritten rules earlier this year, removing an exemption for apps like his. That, he thinks, explains why older apps, such as email service FastMail, which have similar payment models, are still on the store, while his is banned.Analyst Ben Thompson, who writes the influential Stratechery newsletter, said that change appears to have hit many developers. Thompson said he had heard from “over 30” who had experienced problems in the past few months.“Most had similar business models to Hey,” Thompson wrote. “Subscribe on the web, with an app that displayed a sign-in screen (and no link — users had to figure it out themselves) many had been in the App Store for years, but now Apple says they have to add in-app purchases.”The enforcement is also hitting companies selling physical products that require an app to work, as Apple attempts to take a cut of that revenue as well. One developer told the  that the changes the company forced on them have hurt their reputation, hurt their revenue, and made it much easier for pirates to rip off their product. “In the grand scheme of things, we’re small,” they said, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution from Apple. “We’re in the sub-£1m revenue bracket. But we’re probably very representative of where anticompetitive stuff hurts the most.”Hansson argued that antitrust enforcement is needed to solve the problem. “This is not new Apple has captured a key distribution monopoly. The Rockefellers, the Baby Bells, there’s tremendous wealth in doing that, but it depresses innovation, it crushes competition, it hurts consumers.”Apple declined to comment, but a spokesperson pointed the  to an interview App Store head Phil Schiller gave industry site TechCrunch.In a letter to Hansson, shared with the site, Apple wrote: “We understand that Basecamp has developed a number of apps and many subsequent versions for the App Store for many years, and that the App Store has distributed millions of these apps to iOS users. These apps do not offer in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the App Store over the last eight years.”On Monday, Apple is expected to reveal the changes it will make to its operating systems over the next year. But it seems developers hoping for the freedom to avoid paying the toll will have to wait a bit longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4163a9aecb8ad9d65dcc7227256dcdcc2e686e68/852_4110_5341_3203/master/5341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e489649e900f27904b0e67dfc4abd115","title":"the big picture voyage of discovery sydney 2018","story":"An Australian family takes to the sea in search of a modern idyll, in Alex Vaughan’s award-winning photoIn 2016, Steve and Beccie Soetekouw sold their farm on Tasmania, bought a 43ft yacht and, with no boating experience, set off to sail around the world with their 10 children. Photographer Alex Vaughan took this picture – a winner at this year’s OpenWalls Arles awards – off Chinamans Beach in Sydney in 2018, where the family’s boat was moored. The Soetekouws had by then been two years at sea and were celebrating the arrival of a baby girl, Squeak, who was three days old.Vaughan had heard about the family from a friend and rowed out to see them, ending up talking for a couple of hours to Beccie, “while all the kids patiently listened, chiming in occasionally with thoughtful comments and questions, the little ones climbing over the big ones. No devices, no distractions - I had never seen kids as calm and engaged for that period of time.” Vaughan ended up documenting their life on the water over 12 months.For Vaughan, the family came to represent the possibility of different ways of being in the world. The original motivation for the voyage was the familiar one – too much work, too little time together – taken to something of an extreme. The Soetekouws’ experience, Vaughan suggests, showed that “maybe the dream life of large mortgages and the continual and obsessive acquisition of things could be traded for a less traditional lifestyle that puts time with family and in nature at the forefront of existence”.Beccie has taken on most of the responsibility of home-schooling the children while at sea. A year after this picture was taken, tragedy struck the family when their three-year-old daughter, Zeinobiyah, fell from the boat and drowned while they were at anchor in the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney. Though heartbroken, the Soetekouws have not abandoned their nomadic life in February this year, on their Facebook page Our Round the World Adventure, Steve announced to their many followers the birth of a baby girl.

A rugged coastline. A distressed lady in a voluminous pink dress running through the woods. Then two men on horseback. Then a native New Zealander, who is shot by one of the two men on horseback as the whole cast converges on a shack. Distressed Lady reaches the doorway, looks in, sees a dead body, looks down at her hands covered in glittering dust and faints. The shot man recovers, saved from the bullet by the large metal pendant he is wearing, and watches the lady being carried off to the nearest town by the men on horseback.This is the beginning of Eleanor Catton’s six part adaptation of her 2013 Booker-shortlisted novel The Luminaries (BBC One). It promises to be as addictive as it was in its original form. What is the televisual equivalent of a page-turner? A binge-watcher? That, anyway. Characters-with-a-capital-C everywhere, more plot than you know what to do with, hares set running at every turn, lavish period detail and lighting replicating the novel’s gorgeous staginess, and a convoluted murder-mystery. All set against the endlessly febrile atmosphere of the country’s 19th-century gold rush. Oh, also – opium, obstacle-strewn paths to true love, business double-dealing, racism, fortune-telling, brothels, questions of fate and astrolabes.It is glorious escapism, perfect for our times. It matters not at all, for once, that so much must be lost from a book in its translation to screen. The detail in Catton’s original was there largely to make us think about the act of reading, about what we want and expect from a novel constructed along 19th-century literary lines. The story was the wire along which that question was strung. Having wisely decided not to ask viewers the question of what they want and expect from their 21st-century television drama about the 19th-century series, what we are left with is simply a rollicking yarn with expert set dressing, demanding nothing too much in the way of emotional investment. Which is, of course, exactly what we want and expect from our 21st-century television dramas about the 19th century.In flashbacks to nine months before the whole dead-body-in-the-shack debacle, we learn that the Distressed Lady is Our Heroine, Anna Wetherell (Eve Hewson). She is a spirited young woman who has taken herself alone from London to New Zealand for reasons that will, when the plot requires it, become apparent.(Incidentally, I would like very much to watch a series about an unspirited young woman of yesteryear. There is something about the idea of six hour-long episodes of her sitting at home getting increasingly mardy over her embroidery frames, but doing nothing about it, that makes me hysterical while also speaking to me very deeply.)On the ship, Anna meets Emery Staines (Himesh Patel), our hero. There is, as he will later tell one of the Characters-with-a-capital-C (Francis Carver, ex-convict, employed by the local madam who is inveigling Anna into prostitution to do away with him – do try to keep up), “a kind of magic” between them “that is absolute”. We will see what the fates have to say about that.Thanks to a pickpocket, Anna’s illiteracy and the madam – Lydia Wells, played by Eva Green, who dominates every scene she is in – who knows a good recruit when she sees one, our hero and heroine’s plans to meet once docked are thwarted. Thus the seeds are planted for the disaster that is unfolding in the present.In said present, Anna has been thrown in jail, suspected of being a prostitute, at the very least. She manages to pay her bail because, it turns out, there is gold in them there voluminous dress folds. Her memories of the night of the dead body are confused, but they seem to involve a now opium-addicted Emery, the gold-digging husband of Lydia Wells, political machinations and more minor nefariousnesses than you can shake a prospecting stick at.Does The Luminaries have a deeper meaning? Emotional significance? Points of moral instruction or illumination of the human condition? I am not too far into it yet, but my hopes are high that it does not. A cracking, challenging read has become a cracking, unchallenging series and both do their jobs perfectly.

Grant led Union armies to victory in the civil war and as president fought the Ku Klux Klan. But before defeating the slave-owning Confederacy he married into a slave-owning family and briefly owned a slave himself.Roosevelt occupied the White House from 1901 to 1909. A keen outdoorsman and hunter, he helped form the museum’s collection.On Sunday, museum president Ellen Futter told the New York Times: “Over the last few weeks, our museum community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd.”Floyd, an African American man, was killed in May when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protests over his death have expanded nationwide, to encompass other such killings and all police brutality and systemic racism.The statue at the museum on Central Park West in New York shows Roosevelt, the 26th president, on horseback and flanked by an African American and a Native American. It has been the target of protests and calls for it to be taken down for some time. The museum has engaged with the issue before.A historic “Old New York” diorama inside the building which shows Dutch settlers and Native Americans has been given labels explaining its historical context.“We have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism,” Futter said. “Simply put, the time has come to move it.”The museum is part of New York state’s official memorial to Roosevelt, who was born in New York City in 1858 and died on Long Island in 1919.In a statement, New York mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said the museum had asked to remove the statue “because it explicitly depicts black and indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior. The city supports the museum’s request. It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.”What happens to the statue remains to be determined.Theodore Roosevelt IV, a great-grandson of the former president and museum trustee, told the Times he supported the decision.“The world does not need statues, relics of another age, that reflect neither the values of the person they intend to honor nor the values of equality and justice,” he said. “The composition of the Equestrian Statue does not reflect Theodore Roosevelt’s legacy. It is time to move the statue and move forward.”In recent years, Roosevelt’s views on race and his role in the Spanish-American war have attracted criticism. At one protest in 2016, activists called the statue “a stark embodiment of the white supremacy that Roosevelt himself espoused and promoted”.The Times said Futter “made a point of saying that the museum was only taking issue with the statue itself, not with Roosevelt overall”.“It’s very important to note that our request is based on the statue, that is the hierarchical composition that’s depicted in it,” she said. “It is not about Theodore Roosevelt who served as governor of New York before becoming the 26th president of the United States and was a pioneering conservationist.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc0a8d0f781218afde2928e7ceb99d3586143e4/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d96f6d3ac486874298401b078daa3b2","title":"juneteenth celebrations in texas in pictures","story":"Texans turned out for a Juneteenth celebration in Galveston, where the event that inspired the holiday took place in 1865. by  Erum Salam, photographs by Doogie RouxA small but mighty crowd stood 6ft apart in the blistering Texas sun at 10am on the lawn of Galveston’s historic Ashton Villa.The Ashton Villa building once served as a residence of the Confederate army during the civil war. It is the same building from which Mj Gen Gordon Granger of the Union army delivered news that all slaves were free on 19 June 1865 – forever etched in American History as “Juneteenth”, the nation’s true Independence Day.The event was held in honor of Juneteenth and as a memorial for Texas state representative Al Edwards, who spent most of his life trying to get legislation passed to make Juneteenth a paid federal holiday. He died six weeks ago.Rebecca Jimerson pays tribute to Harriet Tubman with an impassioned speech of hope, reminding everyone in attendance of the abolitionist’s contribution to American history.The climate of today’s America was not lost on the speakers, some of whom were Al Edward’s friends and family.

It was a celebration of life – the life of Al Edwards and the lives of those 200,000 slaves freed on this day 155 years ago.

As co-chair of the Al Gore campaign in Florida two decades ago, he watched lawyers brutally slug it out for weeks over vote recounts. “Republicans were very aggressive,” he recalls, “and they beat the Democrats in court.”Twenty years later, America is now staring down the barrel of an election that could make the shenanigans of Bush v Gore in 2000 look like child’s play.Many voting systems across the US are still rickety and unprepared for a massive surge of mail-in ballots. Cyberhacking, disinformation and the coronavirus are new threats. Most ominously, this time there is an incumbent in the White House many fear will sow doubt, thrive on chaos and simply refuse to accept defeat.“The business community is really getting concerned about the integrity of this election,” Klein added. “They’re concerned that it is being set up in a way that if it doesn’t go a certain person’s way, that person may claim that he still has the office and won’t leave. They just feel in terms of the stability of the United States and likelihood of disruption, it’s very, very dangerous.”The race to succeed Bill Clinton in 2000 came to hinge on swing state Florida. Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state and co-chair of George W Bush’s statewide campaign, announced that Bush had won the state. Gore called his opponent to concede but, as the margin narrowed, phoned back to withdraw his concession.Democrats demanded a recount in Florida but Republicans said no. Lawyers joined the battle on both sides, wrangling for five weeks over what voters had intended with poorly designed punch-card ballots (“hanging chads” and “dimpled chads”) and why likely Democrats appeared to have voted for Pat Buchanan, a conservative Christian running as a third-party candidate.Republicans, future Donald Trump ally Roger Stone among them, seized the narrative with hardball tactics that included rowdy protests outside meetings of election officials. The battle went all the way to the supreme court which, in a 5-4 vote, ruled that no alternative method of recount could be established in a timely manner. Bush would be the 43rd president Gore said he disagreed with the verdict but accepted it.Two decades on, both sides are already hiring lawyers for a bitter struggle that might go way beyond a handful of counties in a single state. A preview was offered by a recent primary election in Georgia, where voters waited up to five hours to cast ballots at some polling places due to equipment problems, workers being unfamiliar with a new voting system and pandemic-related physical distancing measures.Many voters showed up to vote in person because absentee ballots they requested never arrived by mail. Officials said thousands of mailed-in ballots may not have been counted because of faulty software or badly calibrated vote-tabulation scanners. To avoid similar setbacks in November, Democrats and voting rights activists are pushing for a massive expansion of mail-in voting.Ron Wyden, Democratic senator for Oregon, which already votes by mail, warned in a Medium post this week: “If Congress and states don’t act immediately, our country could face an electoral Chernobyl this fall.”In a phone interview, Wyden added: “We already know that Donald Trump is going to say the election has been stolen from him, no matter what, so we’re trying all the things to take away those kinds of arguments from him. For example, our focus on having the state and federal governments do everything to prepare for expanded voting right now is absolutely key to minimizing the questions.”But Trump has threatened to pull funding from states that have tried to get absentee ballots to all voters. The president has frequently asserted, without evidence, that mail-in voting leads to “total election fraud” and his Republican allies in Congress have repeatedly opposed funding to expand it.It is a claim Trump is likely to make loudly if he is polling badly in November. There are also concerns that he may seek to exploit any hiccups or irregularities Florida, for instance, is a crucial swing state with a long history of glitches. Election experts have warned that results could be delayed in many places, maybe by days, so that the winner is not known on election night – might Trump use that time to spread conspiracy theories and declare victory? Amplified by conservative media, he could establish a momentum that would be hard to stop, reminiscent of Bush in 2000.Klein, who went on to serve in Congress and is now a lawyer based in Fort Lauderdale, said: “President Trump is splashing water on this notion that we’re not gonna have a fair election because there’s fraud, unproven, like he did last time. It’s very troubling to have the person who has the biggest microphone put out those kinds of thoughts and intimidate and scare people into thinking that no matter what the outcome, they’re not going to believe it’s fair. That’s a threat to democracy itself.”Trump’s challenger, Democrat Joe Biden, told Comedy Central’s Daily Show recently: “This president is going to try to steal this election. This is a guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent, voting by mail, while he sits behind the desk in the Oval Office and writes his mail-in ballot to vote in a primary” – referring to Trump himself voting by mail in Florida.But noting that military leaders have recently been willing to speak out against the president, Biden added: “You have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, ‘Well, we’re not a military state, this is not who we are.’ I promise you, I’m absolutely convinced, they will escort him from the White House in a dispatch.”There has never been such a scenario in a country that prides itself on the peaceful transfer of power at each inauguration.Klein remarked: “It’s pretty amazing to think that we’re even having this conversation: that a president wouldn’t leave if he or she was not successful and Biden’s comments that the military will have to intervene and take him out of the White House. That is just like Venezuela it doesn’t sound like the United States. But I think at this stage, people have come to expect Donald Trump is capable of doing anything, so who knows?”Grassroots activists are mobilizing to prevent such a constitutional crisis.Last week the groups Inisible and Stand Up America launched Protect the Results, a joint effort to mobilize millions of Americans should Trump seek to undermine the outcome of the election. The plans include protests and potential work strikes, calls to state and local election officials to ensure that every vote is counted accurately, and applying pressure on officials to defend democracy.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Inisible, said: “You’d have to be living under a rock for the last three and a half years to think that Donald Trump is going to go willingly.The Trump campaign gives short shrift to the concerns. Courtney Parella, deputy press secretary, said: “The Democrats are the only ones trying to create chaos in our election system by pressuring states to switch to universal vote-by-mail, something election experts have already warned that states cannot and should not attempt to do by November.“The media and Democrats, like Senator Wyden, continue to spread fear to keep voters away from the polls while enthusiasm for the president is at a record high. Preventing Americans from voting in-person is voter suppression and pretending that fraud doesn’t exist in mail voting is both dangerous and irresponsible. Make no mistake, if Democrats in Washington take control of elections, we will never see another free and fair election.”But just as in 2000, there appears to be one guaranteed winner of the 2020 election: the legal profession.The looming dispute offers rich pickings. Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University, observed: “Both sides are lawyering up to the eyebrows. There are lawyers in every state, both for the Democrats and for the Republicans, trying, depending on how you view it, either to protect the integrity of the vote or to subvert it.“The worst part of that is people are essentially primed not to trust the process. They know it’s easily manipulated and that makes people more prone to listen to Trump and his minions when they say that the vote was stolen from them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adda81827bde0b4ee6a77f2e86328d1c7598d108/0_132_5665_3398/master/5665.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e2464068a9809cee049999ad0dd7c4af","title":"reopened pubs in england may require drinkers to check in","story":"Health secretary refuses to rule out diners and drinkers having to register as they enter venueCustomers in England may be asked to check in as they arrive at pubs and restaurants, under plans for reopening the hospitality sector that will be confirmed to MPs on Tuesday by the prime minister.Decisions on relaxing the 2-metre distancing rule and reopening hospitality on 4 July are expected to be rubber-stamped at a meeting of the government’s Covid-19 committee on Monday.As well as ministers, the meeting will be attended by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Johnson will then consult with his cabinet on Tuesday before announcing details of the “easements” in the House of Commons.Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on SkyNews, the health secretary confirmed that the government intended to go ahead in line with Boris Johnson’s roadmap, published last month.“In that plan, it states that on around 4 July we will take further measures if it is safe to do so. We talk about hospitality and outdoor hospitality in those plans,” he said. “We are clearly on track for that plan.”Asked about reports that ministers were considering plans to ask diners and drinkers to register as they enter a venue, he said: “I wouldn’t rule that out. There are other countries in the world that take that approach.”In New Zealand, the public use their phones to scan codes as they go into hospitality outlets to build up a “digital diary” of where they have been, so that if a new case emerges, anyone who has been at the same outlet can be contacted easily.However, with the UK’s contact-tracing app already a month overdue and now not expected until autumn, Hancock also suggested that the government might opt for a more low-tech approach, simply requiring venues to collect their customers’ contact details.Johnson commissioned a review of the 2m distancing rule under intense pressure from the hospitality industry, which has warned that many businesses would be rendered unprofitable if it has to be adhered to rigidly even after they are allowed to reopen.Carried out by the No 10 permanent secretary, Simon Case, the review has considered scientific advice but also the economic impacts.Case is expected to conclude that the blanket 2-metre restriction can be lifted and replaced with a “1-metre plus” approach that would allow the public to be closer together if other safety precautions are taken.Asked about that idea, Hancock said: “That is the sort of thing we’re looking at to how do you make it safe to open things – and as safe as possible, to open as much as possible.“Things like wearing a face mask, which reduces the transmission, clearly, how the seating is arranged – because face-to-face is much more dangerous than back-to-back, and there’s much more transmission than side-to-side.”Asked whether hairdressers would be included in the reopening plans, Hancock said: “A lot of the country does need a haircut. We need to do that in a safe way.”However, a group of independent scientists warned that it was not safe to relax distancing rules for indoor settings and that any proposal to reduce to 1 metre would “effectively end” social distancing as people would interpret the change as a return to normal. BAME communities and low-paid workers would be placed at greatest risk, the group known as Independent Sage said, as a higher proportion would be unable to work from home and would be most exposed to the virus.Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and chair of the group, said: “The rate of infection is still far too high to consider this even with mitigating measures. There are more than 1,000 new cases a day and still no functioning tracing system. It is vital that the government releases the evidence it has used to make this decision.”Downing Street sources rejected the idea that 4 July should be dubbed “independence day”, stressing that the latest changes could be the first to be reversed if the number of cases rises again.“The reason we are able to move forward this week is because the vast majority of people have taken steps to contain the virus. The more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing rules,” said a No 10 spokesperson. “We will not hesitate to put the handbrake on to stop the virus running out of control.”People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Meanwhile, the chancellor is preparing a mini-budget, expected to include measures to stimulate consumer demand and encourage job creation, in the teeth of what he has conceded may be a deep recession.Hancock declined to comment on reports that Rishi Sunak was considering an emergency cut in VAT. “That is absolutely a matter for a budget, and you wouldn’t expect me to comment either way on any speculation,” he said. “But the broader point is true, which is that the economy has taken a terrible hit, and we need to get it back on its feet and give people the confidence to get out there.”A VAT cut would echo a decision made by the former chancellor Alistair Darling as the economy slid into recession during the global financial crisis in late 2008. Whitehall sources suggested the Treasury remained sceptical about whether such a move represents good value for money – but confirmed that it was under consideration, in a bid to boost confidence.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, suggested Labour would back the lifting of the 2-metre rule if other safety measures were brought in.“Yes, under certain circumstances, but we also need to see a greater use of face masks, I would have thought. For certain staff, workers, who are public facing in their day-to-day action, a greater use of face shielding, let’s get track-and-trace up and running.“This still remains a deadly virus we cannot be complacent, so if we are going to relax some measures, we need to make sure other mitigation measures are in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d12688543d9666aaa12d067a1e946578e5b73d/0_125_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90545ff0fc3463395624ed7593148ecf","title":"yemen separatists seize island of socotra from saudi backed government","story":"Southern Transitional Council has taken control of remote archipelago in the Arabian SeaYemeni separatists have seized control of the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea, deposing its governor and driving out the forces of the Saudi-backed government, which condemned the action as a coup.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) declared self-rule in the south of the country in April, complicating UN efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in a war that has separatists and the government fighting as nominal allies in a Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, who control the north.On Saturday, the STC announced it had seized government facilities and military bases on the main island of Socotra, a sparsely populated archipelago which sits at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.The government, which is led by President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, condemned the action as a “full-fledged” coup and accused STC forces of attacking government buildings in “gang-style behaviour”.The Socotra governor, Ramzi Mahroos, accused coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of turning a blind eye. The UAE has previously backed STC forces with airstrikes in fighting against the government in the south.The coalition’s Saudi spokesman and the UAE foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.Yemen\u0026nbsphas been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign.By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana’a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military.Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 – in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi’s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north.The Houthis captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh.Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia, which has tried to broker a deal between the STC and Hadi’s government, had presented a proposal to end the separatist standoff, but the STC subsequently denied receiving it.Riyadh wants to prevent another front developing in Yemen’s multifaceted war, which has been locked in military stalemate for years.The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government for power in the capital, Sana’a, in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.Socotra, a Unesco world heritage site due to its unique fauna and flora, is located in the shipping lane linking Asia to the Europe via the Red Sea and Suez canal.

Both had the same number of votes, just as had happened in the last election in 2017 it was 19-19, in 2020 it was 26-26.The result was decided by the toss of a coin. It fell for Makaseau Ioane, and with it went the seat in parliament. Unadulterated by formal political parties, attack ads, or costly campaigns, elections on the tight-knit Pacific island of Niue are democracy in pure form.In this year’s poll, sitting MP Opili Talafasi was returned to his seat with 14 votes. Several other electorates were won uncontested. A coral island in the South Pacific, one-sixth the size of greater London, Niue is a self-governing state in “free association” with New Zealand, which is 2,400km to the south-west and which holds responsibility for its defence and international relations.Formally, Niue is a member of the Realm of New Zealand: the Queen is Niue’s head of state.This year’s general election at the end of May has brought the first change of leader in the country in a dozen years. Premier Sir Toke Talagi – the country’s only knight – was not re-elected after a dozen years in office: ill-health had kept him from much of the campaign.New premier Dalton Tagelagi wants to open his country to other Pacific countries and its benefactor, New Zealand. Niue’s isolation has spared it a single case of Covid-19, but the country is hugely dependent on remittances, foreign aid, and tourism, which have been devastated by the pandemic shutdowns.“I’ll be speaking with the PM of NZ later and look at opening the Pacific bubble – the Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga and Samoa. We don’t have any planes but they do,” TV Niue reported him saying.Tagelagi is well-known on the island. A parliamentarian for 12 years, minister for six, and the son of the country’s first parliamentary speaker, Tagelagi is also an international-level lawn bowler, having represented Niue in bowls at the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games.It’s not known whether the premier will continue to bowl for his country as well as lead it politically.Tagelagi told Pacific Media Network (PMN) Niue, that his small nation would have to make “sacrifices” to counter significant budgetary shortfalls brought by the isolation and economic destruction of the Covid-19 shutdowns and travel bans.Tourism is a significant earner for the country’s fragile economy, but the country has been isolated for the course of the pandemic.“Be prepared and be supportive, we need the support of our people. We … can’t always have the good days, some days are bad days, but you’ve got to make sacrifices with it, in order to return to the good old happy days.”In the 1960s, more than 5000 people lived on Niue, but the country’s population has steadily drained in the decades since, as young Niuens, in particular, leave the island for education and employment.Sam Pilisi, a Niuen community youth leader based in New Zealand, said retaining young people and families on Niue had been an issue for decades.“I am hopeful for change, be it economic, social or cultural progress for Niue. There is a mix of experienced members and fresh blood in the Fale Fono (Parliament), so I hope this heralds a new way forward of embracing some new innovative ideas and solutions for Niue’s future,” Pilisi said.But some commentators argue the new leader does not necessarily reflect a change in Niue governance.“It’s interesting that people wanted to change but they defaulted to the old guard,” Dr Colin Tukuitonga, Niuen regional health expert and academic, told ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbc84fd96c696f5c6c60b330b13660a7643a91e6/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e772648db79fa90804759b7fc100806e","title":"coronavirus live news covid 19 update china us uk brazil latest updates","story":"China halts imports from US food plant where 481 test positive for Covid-19 UK PM to unveil lockdown easing on Tuesday Brazil deaths pass 50,000.

The government has said the actual number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil the latest easing of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown on Tuesday when he will also announce the conclusion of a review into whether a two-metre rule on social distancing should be relaxed, his office said.Britain’s economy has been hammered by the lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19 and although non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen last Monday, many businesses, particularly in the hospitality and leisure sectors, have remained closed.Some lawmakers in Johnson’s party have been vocal in calling for him to drop the two-metre rule saying it was having a devastating impact on the economy which shrank by a quarter over March and April. But the government has been cautious, saying it did not want to risk a second spike in novel coronavirus cases.Johnson’s office said the prime minister would tell parliament on Tuesday which sectors would be allowed to reopen on 4 July under the government’s roadmap out of the lockdown. Detailed guidance would be provided to each sector so businesses were “Covid secure”.The Sunday  reported that Johnson would also announce a change to the social distancing guidelines so people would only need to remain one metre apart providing they took additional measures such as wearing a mask.China’s customs authority said on Sunday it had suspended imports of poultry products from a plant owned by US-based meat processor Tyson that has been hit by the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. The General Administration of Customs said on its website it had decided on the suspension after the company confirmed a cluster of coronavirus cases at facilities in Arkansas where a total of 481 people tested positive for the virus.Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said the company was looking into the issue, adding Tyson works closely with US authorities to ensure its food is produced in full compliance with government safety requirements.“It is important to note that the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control \u0026amp Prevention, USDA and the US Food \u0026amp Drug Administration agree that there is no evidence to support transmission of Covid-19 associated with food,” he told Reuters in an email.China also suspended pork products from German pork processor Toennies last week following a coronavirus outbreak among hundreds of its workers.China has stepped up its oversight of imported foods after a new cluster of coronavirus cases were linked to a sprawling wholesale food market in the capital just over a week ago.Beijing began testing meat, seafood and fresh produce for the coronavirus last week and some ports were opening all containers of meat to carry out coronavirus tests. On Friday, customs asked food exporters to sign a declaration that their produce is not contaminated by the virus.Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThere was no sign of much change in consumer behaviour as folk lined up in their hundreds to buy cheap clothes from Penneys when its flagship shop on Dublin’s Mary Street reopened 10 days ago after three months in mothballs.Government pleas to “stay local and shop local” also appeared to go unheeded in the line outside Zara in the Dundrum Town Centre when its doors opened again last Monday while those standing in line outside Ikea a week before that seemed more concerned about what another country could do for them than what they could do for their country.But major reopenings aside, there are still unmistakable signs that the habits Irish shoppers picked up over more than 10 weeks of confinement and curtailment might endure. While it is probably too much for Irish retailers to hope that Amazon will be Amazgone or Asos will go Awol, there is a definite sense that more people will choose to continue shopping in their local communities in the weeks and months ahead.And if that happens we will all benefit. Yes, Dan’s Dodgy Deals which is operating out of a warehouse in a country 5,000km away might be able to sell you stuff cheap but at what cost ultimately? If we all shop online all the time then our local retailers will disappear and we will all be the poorer.More than two-thirds of the more than €5 billion Irish consumers spend online each year disappears overseas. If we are buying more and more online then we are losing the local multiplier effect which means that every €100 spent in the local economy is actually worth €500.Local spending can increase by that much because the money circulates in the local economy. It is spent on locally-sourced goods and services and wages, which are also spent locally. But when the spending is online and outside the country, then all of the money is just vacuumed up and leaves the country.Permanent changeAccording to the EY Future Consumer Index published earlier this month, the global consumer is changing rapidly, with 45 per cent of people saying that how they shop will change permanently as a result of the pandemic, with 38 per cent saying it will permanently change what they buy.Speaking to this page last month about how the consumer mindset might shift, Yvonne Keily of that consultancy firm said an “interesting shift is how we will view time, talent and natural resources”.She said we would most likely regard such things as “increasingly precious, with traditional notions of status receding, replaced by purpose and social good. We are likely to see an increase in people buying local and, even more interest in transparency around the farm-to-fork and maker-to-model journey of our goods. The whole value ecosystem around packaging efficiency, the validity of brands and the ease of accessing, assessing and buying goods and services will also be under scrutiny.”Jean McCabe, a retailer with boutiques in both Ennis and Galway and acting head of umbrella group Retail Excellence Ireland, told Pricewatch recently that after opening her shops in early June she had detected “a real appetite out there to support local businesses and get back to what is the biggest hobby in the world. I think that desire to shop local is something that will endure. People are really conscious about where they are shopping now.”Glenna Lynch, meanwhile, owns a sofa shop in Dublin and said the pandemic may give retailers the “impetus to offer something distinctly better than click-and-buy across all types of product. Maybe this is the arrival of unique offerings that will put the human and personal contact back into buying, the pushback against Amazon.”Kasha Connolly is the Willy Wonka of the west and the brains and creative heart of Hazel Mountain Chocolate, a small chocolate factory located in Co Clare. “I think the lockdown and the pandemic has recalibrated people’s awareness of local businesses and it is almost like they rediscovered the absolute necessity of small shops,” she says.“It helped people to reconnect with their local communities and even after crisis lifts, even after people might take a little step back, I believe that connection with local retailers will endure. I think the pandemic made people realise that maybe that less is more, that maybe they don’t need 10 pairs of socks from Penneys and maybe I can have three pairs that I mind better.”She says that as she has started to get back to the business of chocolate and coffee, it has been “really nice to see loads of people coming in. I think people like to see the connection between the producer and the product and to understand all the hard work that goes into making something. As a society we are re-evaluating so many things in our lives and shopping is just one of those elements. I think there is a much greater understanding today that if you buy local, then the money stays local, all that money stays in Ireland.”She says the economic crisis the country is now confronting will impact on how people spend. “We are definitely going to mind our money because we’re going to have to mind but I think people might become better shoppers and spend more sometimes but buy less and keep the things they bought for longer.”Certainly we could do with being better shoppers. We live in a world where too many people treat clothes almost like they are disposable items, with some shops selling stuff so cheaply that there is little incentive to take care of it.Collectively Ireland throws away more than a million tonnes of food every year and about a third of what the typical shopper buys ends up in the bin – the cost to inidual consumers is more than €1,000. The cost to the environment is almost incalculable. Local shopping has helped to reduce the waste, however, as it is easier to buy only what you need when you are not bombarded with special offers on stock you don’t want and don’t need at every turn in the supermarket.Accessibility“A big problem for Irish people is accessibility. They really want to shop locally and support the people in their communities – that is almost in our DNA – but there have been issues when it comes to the ease of doing that online and what our platform wanted to do was make that as comfortable and as pleasurable an experience as possible,” says Tara Prendergast.Her platform is thebiscuitmarketplace, an online platform which allows Irish artists, designers and producers get their products online in a comparatively simple fashion.But in recent weeks Prendergast has been thinking about more than just the biscuit. “During the pandemic, people have had time to think about their lives and have had time to experience all the amazing local businesses,” she says. “And may of those business have started providing services in a completely different way.”She suggests that a key focus in the weeks ahead should be “about keeping the money in the community, I think that’s incredibly important. Shopping local is obviously on trend now but it would be so simple to sleepwalk back into way we were I think it’s the responsibility of the media and the Government and influencers and retailers and people like me to campaign for local shopping to become an ongoing thing.”She says people need to be reminded of the difference small acts can have. “I think it is important to keep telling people that if they spend even €5 more in their local community each week it makes a difference to the people you’re spending your money with. When you spend within your community almost half of what you spend gets recirculated in the local economy, it’s not much more than 10 per cent if you spend with a big multinational retailer and how much goes back into your local community it if you spend with a big online retailer based overseas?”She concludes with a simple message for everyone. “I think what we could all do is look at three things we could in terms of spending that could make an impact on our local communities this week. Just keep it simple and if just 1,000 people were to do those things, whatever then might be, then it could make an enormous difference to people across the country.”Just three things? How hard can that be?Keeping it local – what difference does it make?1. Help your neighbours. If you shop at locally-owned businesses, more of your money stays in your local community because locally-owned businesses tend to buy goods and serves from other locally-owned businesses.2. A charity bounce. Charities have been hit hard by the crisis. While big companies – or at least some of them – contribute to charitable causes on a local level, local companies are likely to do that more frequently and in a more granular way.3. The country character. While big retailers and online giants undoubtedly have a role to play, do we really want to strip the heart and soul out of our towns and villages by spending all our money with them? The US main street has been decimated by the Walmarts of the world. There will be no point mourning the passing of the shops and businesses that make Ireland unique if we do not support them while they are still here.4. Think of the environment. Local shops buying local produce from local farms and selling it to local people leave a much smaller carbon footprint than giant retailers flying products in from all over the world to central distribution centres and then driving them all over the country to us. The locally-bought produce tastes better too.5. Gizza job. The economy is facing enormous challenges in the months ahead as the aftershocks of the pandemic reverberate. If you shop locally you will support local jobs and everyone wins.6. Better customer service. One of the things people have discovered in recent weeks is the pleasure of doing business with people who know their names. Many people were starved of human contact during the lockdown and the small interactions with local retailers became a lifeline and those local retailers deserve to be rewarded for that as things get back to normal. Not only that, a local retailer who knows who you are is more likely to entertain your complaints and care about looking after you when if there is a problem. Do you really think some AI bot working out of some server farm in Mongolia really cares if you are having a problem with that T-shirt you bought online?Have a butcher’s: how it should be doneMcLoughlin’s Craft Butchers is a third generation family business which has been operating in Dublin since 1965. It is run by a father and daughter team, Pat and Kate McLoughlin.Their main business has long been the supply of beef, lamb, pork and cooked meats to some of Dublin’s finest restaurants and hotels, including Guilbaud’s and Coppinger Row but, with the closure of the entire restaurant sector last March, that revenue stream all but completely dried up.It has been a different story entirely when it comes to the butcher shop and delicatessen in Ballyfermot and new avenues have opened up in recent weeks including a delivery service and a move into farmer’s markets while customers in the area have rediscovered the joys of keeping it local.“For the past decade the shop has been in decline as we were surrounded by Aldis and Lidls and Tescos but the last few weeks have seen a reversal and we have really reconnected with people who maybe only would have come in at Christmas.”Kate is realist and knows that many people will most likely return to their old ways of shopping with the big multiples once the country restarts and routines return. “But I think real connections have been made and I hope many customers will keep coming back to us,” she says.She is not, however just hoping and nor is she willing to passively wait for customers to come through the doors. “Retailers like us have a job to do and we have to be inventive and creative and we have to ersify. Wholesale made up around 80 per cent of our business and it will be a long time before that comes back to the level it was so we have to continue to reach new customers and we have to explore new channels with online sales and markets.“The job of a small business is to make it easy for people to shop with us. We can’t just sit back and wait for customers to walk into their local shops, we have to work hard at continuing to provide an excellent service, maybe by delivering to their doors or being where they are. We have to make it easier for people to support us”.She says that as more people have shopped with local butchers and greengrocers they have come to appreciate the quality and the value to be found there. “People are going to be more careful with their money, of course they are, but I think shopping locally allows for better meal planning which will reduce food waste and ultimately save people money.”What readers sayLast week on Twitter we asked if people had been shopping locally more in recent months than they might have done in pre-pandemic times and if they had any tips on how to do it better. This is just small selection of what came back.“My farmer’s market stalls have been developing click and collect and I now shop online for all my fresh and seasonal food midweek. What I can’t get I add to my supermarket list knowing that my veg and fish orders are at Naomh Olaf GAA club food market on a Friday. Aidan’s fish stall initially had a WhatsApp group for customers and offered a delivery service to cocooners but as the roads were so clear, he delivered to all. He now operates click and collect and still delivers to cocooners. The site is eastcoastfish.ie and IG @outofthebluemarket. Also the farmers market is IG @naomholaffood.” – Melissa O’Callaghan“I will be supporting local shops much more than large supermarkets from now on. Was pleasantly surprised at what a large range of items Behan’s in Kill have. Great staff, efficient and pleasant. Think we will all reassess our shopping habits.” – Mary MacRory“Buying most of my books online from independent bookstores now and trying to support more Irish clothing companiesboutiques \u0026amp pharmacies.” – Claire McGing“Buy from horses for courses. Talk to your butcher. You wouldn’t ask a farrier to size your shoes or a dentist to treat your gout. Buy from merchants who know their product and customers. Buy local and try and buy Irish, if not buy European.”– Justin Leonard“Small local shops all the way. Haven’t gone in a major supermarket since beginning of lockdown.” – JP McMahon“I bought a new helmet at the local bike store (would usually shop Amazon), going to local fruit and veg shop and I’m only buying what I need – less waste. I cycle to the local butcher every Saturday with my kids, they love it.” – Mischa McInerney“Noticed I could order from my local bookstore @WoodbineBooks so chose them over Amazon – they even dropped to my door for free. Also ordered the @BellLaneCoffee they use for the full experience!” – Róis Ní Fhloinn“The seed potato company is another fabulous local service I discovered. Fabulous fresh fruit \u0026amp veg!” – Elizabeth O’Leary“Our local butcher and veggie shop played a stormer. Being able to leave a list in and then pick up later was a revelation. Joints properly sized for 4 rather than buying larger joints at cut price and creating lots of waste. My change. Buy right sized.” – Denise Edwards“Yes @EnglishMarket \u0026amp started shopping in @dunnesstores – I try to keep going before my vouchers expire. . . the stress! Have given up Amazon. Trying to avoid spending anywhere that isn’t Irish owned.” – Ruth Fuller“Local butchers (Smyths, Raheny) a few times a week. Bread from bakery (the amazing Bread Naturally). The rest from SuperValu and Nolan’s (local-ish).” – Anne-Louise Foley“It’s often a simple case of looking for what you need locally. We don’t always know what’s available to us by our neighbours. Support a hard-working family whose kids go to the same school as yours. They give your kids birthday cards, lifts to matches.” – Juliet O’Connell"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4284933.1592772428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"work to level 50 year old ballymun shopping centre starts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemolition under way on Ballymun shopping centre earlier this month. Photograph: Crispin RodwellWork to raze the old Ballymun shopping centre, which has for years blocked completion of the regeneration of the north Dublin suburb, has begun more than 20 years after it was first planned.The 50-year-old centre, the last remaining vestige of the 1960s high-rise suburb yet to be redeveloped, has been boarded up awaiting demolition for almost two years. Preliminary works for the its removal started late last year, but the heavy demolition works have now begun, with contractors expected to return the cleared site to Dublin City Council by December. The council will then seek expressions of interest for the redevelopment of a retail and residential complex on the site, which is designated as a future location for an underground metro station. At least 300 apartments are expected to be built in addition to shopping facilities, which Independent councillor Noeleen Reilly said are badly needed.“The failure to redevelop the shopping centre site has caused a lot of bad feeling in the area for a long number of years. This site should be the jewel in the crown of Ballymun,” she said. RedevelopmentMs Reilly said she understood the rationale of clearing the site before bringing it to market “to make it as attractive a development proposal as possible” but she said it was essential that momentum for its redevelopment and the provision of new retail facilities was not lost.“Seeing the diggers on site now is a really positive step. Obviously financing are going to be tight in the coming months, but it’s vital the redevelopment of this site goes ahead. In my view, it should have been the first thing to happen in the regeneration of Ballymun.”The redevelopment of the shopping centre, known as the Town Centre, was central to the 1997 Ballymun regeneration plan. In 2000, Treasury Holdings paid more than £6 million for a 53 per cent stake in the site, with the council retaining the remainder. The new complex, which was to be the main shopping facility for the suburb’s 18,000 residents, was due to be built in 2005.However, it was not until 2009 that Treasury secured planning permission for Springcross, a vast €800 million development, which was to include an 11-screen cinema, bowling alley, public library, creche and restaurants, as well as more than 70 shops and offices.Economic crashIt had intended to begin construction the following year, but the economic crash intervened and the town centre lands became part of Nama’s portfolio of loans before any development began. Most retailers in the centre subsequently shut up shop and, in early 2014, it lost Tesco, its anchor tenant.In May 2014, the council reached agreement with Nama and its receivers to acquire the Treasury stake. Two years later the council sought compulsory purchase orders to gain clear possession of the site.The final tenants left the shopping centre in summer 2018. However, it was not until the following year that the €1.9 million demolition contract was awarded."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Fund will use levy on oil companies to invest in green projects over the next decadeClimate change remains an abstraction for many in Ireland, but not for those suffering in AfricaScale of action requires changing direction of the whole economy, says Prof Peter Thorne"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4284911.1592768097!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government publishes legislation setting up 500m climate action fund","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2019 is being published by Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton, who said the State had an “enormous transition” to makeThe Government will publish legislation on Monday\u0026nbspto establish\u0026nbspa €500 million climate action fund, using the proceeds of an existing levy paid by oil companies for climate action projects.The legislation, which will be brought to the Dáil later this year if a government is formed this week, would establish a fund to invest in projects that would help decarbonise the economy over the next decade.A number of projects have already been funded on an interim basis, including €20 million to develop the ESB charging network for electric cars.The legislation, the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2019, is being published by Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton, who said the State had an “enormous transition” to make.“That transition presents opportunities to be seized as well as patterns to be changed.

The group, which runs Talbot Lodge nursing home in Malahide, Co Dublin, and homes in Stradbally, Co Laois Ballyragget, Co Kilkenny Moycullen, Co Galway and Castlebar, Co Mayo, attributes its management of the pandemic to early action and intervention.On March 10th, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan questioned the decision of private homes to close to visitors four days earlier before restrictions were “really necessary”. On March 11th, the State announced visitor restrictions in long-term care homes. The first Covid-19 death was announced that day.Brookhaven says it had one Covid-19 death in its home in Abbeybreaffy near Castlebar, and is challenging the HSE over its estimate in an internal list compiled last month – and published by The  – that the home had two confirmed and probable deaths from the disease. Tested positiveAccording to the group, the deceased resident had visited a local hospital whilst in palliative care, and tested positive after they died at the home in early April. The group had a resident in Teagleach Uillinn in Moycullen who tested positive for Covid-19 in the mass testing of homes but was asymptomatic. In both cases the homes imposed strict isolation, and the group says it limited the disease to these two cases across 380 residents in the five homes.Mr Murphy said the group was alerted to the risks posed by the virus to older people and in congregated settings such as care homes from tracking international media reports in January and February about how the disease was being transmitted and how it could “go global”. “We basically decided that if this is going to be an issue we can’t understand how it is going to happen. We have got to do everything possible to manage the problem. It was impossible to predict what was going to happen,” he said.The group recognised that nursing homes and hospitals used foreign agency staff who tend to live with each other. Therefore on February 14th, Brookhaven directed that any of its 380 staff who had travelled abroad, including to Northern Ireland, to self-isolate and not to come to work for 14 days.The group felt it had to be “extra careful” with Talbot Lodge as it was a 112-bed facility near Dublin Airport with lots of traffic “in and out”, says Mr Murphy.In addition, the group started stockpiling personal protective equipment in February. Angry reactionOn February 26th, Brookhaven banned visitors that had been to any destination outside of Ireland in the previous four weeks, before banning all visitors on March 6th. The group received an angry reaction from some relatives of residents at the time.“They are thrilled and delighted now. They have come up and said we were wrong, and you protected our loved one,” said Mr Murphy.He believes Tadhg Daly, the chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents private nursing homes (80 per cent of the sector), should have been a member of NPHET from the outset. “It’s not too late for this to happen given the expectation of a second Covid-19 wave.” Mr Murphy is unsure whether there will be a second resurgence, but, as with the group’s cautious approach before the first confirmed Covid-19 case in February, is not taking chances. “We are going on the basis that there will. I think that is the right thing to do: to prepare for the worst. I think that is what we have to do.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fund will use levy on oil companies to invest in green projects over the next decadeCare homes managed by Brookhaven began introducing restrictions in mid-FebruaryShops and apartments to be built on site which is designated as a future metro stationFine Gael sources say they would not govern with Fianna F\u0026aacuteil if Greens turn down dealMaura Byrne\u0026rsquos husband died of the virus while she was recovering in hospitalHSE chief Paul Reid warned of likely \u0026lsquounforeseen consequences\u0026rsquo of three-month dealGarda\u0026iacute believe victim Jean Eagers and the suspect were known to one anotherMan allegedly wrote derogatory comment in book before boasting on social mediaRyan argues the deal is the best one available, and will enable historic progress on climate actionResidents picketed landlord\u0026rsquos home after they tried to get him to stop students carousing\u0026lsquoI like her\u0026rsquo: Sinn F\u0026eacutein leader tells podcast she admires DUP leader Arlene FosterChief suspect is known to woman and was arrested after confrontation with garda\u0026iacuteBrother said he had \u0026lsquoall the values you would associate with a good and decent human being\u0026rsquoFuneral of fatally shot detective garda takes place in home town of Charlestown, Co MayoFacemasks and distancing set aside as longest day of the year marked on Hill of TaraU2 singer: \u0026lsquoTo climb out from under the heel of colonialism to take a seat ...

There was good camaraderie,” she laughs, “Nonetheless it was serious stuff.”Ireland was thought to have a good chance against Canada and Norway, but the required two-thirds majority on the first round was seen to be a stretch. However, 128 votes were secured, securing a place for two years beginning in January. Byrne-Nason and colleagues watched the results unfold from their 2nd Avenue skyscraper office in mid-town Manhattan. Back in Dublin, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney did the same in Merrion Street, with Foreign Affairs doing the same in Iveagh House. “I don’t think I even heard the announcement of the final vote as the room just erupted,” she recalls, “This is the highest ambition you can have when you serve as Ambassador to the UN – see your country take a seat at the Security Council table.”Ireland’s bid for a seat has dominated her time in New York, where she arrived in 2017. Though Ireland had declared its candidacy in 2005, preparations stepped-up in 2018. Following that the pace was relentless.“The United Nations is unique in that every single function is a working event. You can’t miss a national day reception, or turn down an invitation to a function,” she said. Each gathering requires meticulous preparation.“My team briefs me on which ambassadors are going to be there, what issues are of interest to them at that particular moment. It means being on top of the issues that have happened that day and that may be of relevance to them.” Junior diplomatByrne-Nason’s career began in 1981. In the mid-1980s she posted to the UN in New York as a junior diplomat. Later she spent eight years at the Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, before returning to Dublin. She subsequently served as Ireland’s Permanent Representative to the European Union in Brussels. In 2011 she became second secretary general in the Department of the Taoiseach. Terms as ambassador to France and Monaco between 2014 and 2017 came before a return to the UN. Originally from Drogheda, Byrne-Nason is proud of her roots, displaying a framed photograph of suffragettes marching through the town in the late 1890s presented to her by a Co Louth group visiting during St Patrick’s Day celebrations in New York. She brought the picture to the United Nations in December 2018 as she introduced the late Eavan Boland, who had written a poem to mark 100 years since the extension of voting rights to Irish women. “Eavan’s poem was titled Our Future will Become the Past of Other Women, and I thought that the image of these women, all dressed in white, walking through the streets of my home town in Ireland captured this theme perfectly. “Here I was, from a small town in Ireland and now representing my country at the UN. It was down to women such as these who helped make women’s participation in public life possible,” she told The . Role of womenDuring her tenure at the UN, Byrne-Nason has chaired the UN’s Commission on the Status of Women, highlighting the role women played in Northern Ireland peace-building, one that could be copied by women in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere.Preparations for January are already under way, and will intensify in early September. Ireland will become an official observer in October, permitted to sit in on meetings. The existing Irish diplomatic staff at the UN will jump from 12 “to about 23”, along with local staff.“We know from other countries’ experiences that it is vital to have this level of staffing to be able to cover the ground,” she says. “It’s 20 years since we last sat on the council, so there is already lots of preparation work under way in Dublin.”The agenda list is huge. Afghanistan and Yemen will most likely dominate along with Israeli-Palestinian tensions, particularly if Israel moves ahead with plans to annex parts of the West Bank this year. And then there is the outcome of November’s US presidential election. For Byrne-Nason, her first time sitting at the famous Security Council horseshoe table will mark a personal as well as professional achievement. Thirty years ago she sat outside that same room, waiting for “someone to come out with information”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The fire sales are a result of expats left jobless by the UAE’s coronavirus lock-down. Among them, thousands of British expats are trying to scrape back the pennies before they are forced to leave a place many call home.The coronavirus lockdown has upended the lives of thousands of expats, turning their dream of a life abroad into a nightmare of uncertainty. Thousands have been made redundant, with strict visa regulations forcing them to return to the UK, with little time to catch their breath.  It’s almost 11 years since Selina Dixon traded her claustrophobic commute from Surrey into Central London for her expat dreams of Dubai.“I was spending four hours a day on the train,” she tells The .The fashion marketer left behind the early morning drizzle and commuter grind, for a new life in the UAE. One which promised year-round sun, tax-free salaries, and the opportunity of adventure.“It’s not about the glitz and glamour, whoever has been fortunate enough to live here know there is much more behind the façade,” she says.An estimated 240,000 Britons call the UAE home, working as everything from air hostesses to teachers.Dixon was made redundant a few weeks ago, now she is living off her meagre savings. In weeks her visa will expire, and she wont be able to renew it unless she finds a new job.“Every day you wake up, you’re looking on LinkedIn. Speaking to contacts and your network, but then you have to be mindful there are so many people going through this.”With thousands of people flying in and out of the UAE every day in normal times, the country was always vulnerable to Covid-19. A  stringent lockdown saw swathes of the economy shut. Though some 40,000 cases of the virus have been registered, Dubai is slowly beginning to open up, yet the economic recovery will likely take many years.Ninety per cent of the UAE’s population are expats, and a study out this month by Oxford Economics, a quantitative analysis firm, estimates that the country of nine million could lose up to 900,000 jobs, and some 10 per cent of its population – British expats are likely to be among the worst affected.At least part of the difficulty lies in the UAE’s Kafala – or sponsorship - system. A visa scheme wherein residency is tied to your job. Companies may sponsor a foreigner for residency as long as they employ them, but the moment someone becomes unemployed, a count-down begins on the expiry of their visa.As Dixon says, “Dubai is a place that without a visa - it’s difficult.”Though the government has announced some visa waivers, those who have lost their jobs since March 1st have thirty days to find a new job, or their visas become invalid, and they will be hit with daily fines.It means that those like Dixon may be forced to return to the UK for the first time in years. “It was not a choice that I was ready to make, but one that I may have to make.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"driveway renting soars 650pc commuters avoiding public transport","story":"First time driveway renting has surged by 550 percent since last year, with commuters intent on avoiding public transport fuelling a recent spike.KERB, an online platform that connects people to parking spaces across the UK, has seen new enquiries for unoccupied driveway slots soar to 416 between April and June, up from 64 over the same period in 2019.It says there has been a sharp rise in workers booking spaces deeper into city centres in order to walk to their nearby offices amid fears of contracting Covid-19 on trains and buses.Robert Brown, the CEO of KERB, told The : “The general public has been scarred by socially distancing. People are wary of getting back onto dirty buses and trains in close proximity to each other. \u0027Dirt\u0027 and \u0027distance\u0027 are the new key performance indicators by which public transport, office environments and car parks will be measured, going forward.”“Once cities return to normal, we are expecting to see a two-fold increase in year-on-year overall demand for driveway parking in the inner cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast,” he added. With the help of parking websites, renting driveways to motorists has become a common way for those living near retail centres, sports grounds and train stations to supplement their incomes.Before accepting bookings on the online apps, homeowners are usually required to prove their identity and take pictures of the driveways to showcase to potential bidders.The latest research estimates there are more than 350,000 available parking spaces on driveways in the UK, with residents in Kensington and Chelsea making the most from renting them, earning £3,804 per year on average.The peripheries of Zones 1 and 2 in London are being particularly sought after by workers returning to city and construction jobs who feel driving is the safest way to commute.Tom Stanley, 24, a tax adviser from Fulham, said: “We started renting our driveway around two to three years ago because we have a space in a great location, which brings in around £15 on average every day.” “We thought the demand would decrease at the beginning of the lockdown but this was not the case. We have never had a more busy month than the one we just had. Our location is near Stamford Bridge and a hospital which charges around £25 to park. Most of the people we get are builders and staff that work there.” Despite some councils asking for fees, the Government has said homeowners do not need planning permission to rent driveways as long as it is not a nuisance to neighbours.While noise complaints are rare, some renters at risk of redundancy are now more likely to prioritise steady revenue streams over the perceived characteristics of buyers from their digital profiles.Anthony Eskinazi, the founder of JustPark, the largest online parking platform in the UK with over 250,000 spaces, added: “The average parking duration has gone up since lockdown by 25-30 percent. Motorists, and specifically commuters, are often booking for 2 months or more, whereas before, they would reserve each day at a time. Now, they are worried that space is going to get taken up by someone else so they are booking in advance to guarantee their space.” “With the price increase of the congestion charge, we have already seen a surge in new spaces being added on the outskirts of the zone and across the country as those furloughed and recently unemployed look to top up their income.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first nightclub british isles opens doors guernsey sports teams","story":"Late into the night, more than 400 young people will squeeze their way into a Guernsey nightclub to revel in a pastime once banned as a dangerous threat to public health. The DJ will power up the 50,000-watt sound system and dazzling lighting rig as the crowd are expected to dance without a care in the world for social distancing.Those youngsters will become the first people to visit a nightclub in the British Isles since the coronavirus lockdown in March.Fusion Night Club has, like so many other businesses on Guernsey, opened for the first time on Friday as islanders celebrated reaching ‘Phase Five’ of its success story in defeating Covid-19, way ahead of the UK and many other European countries.Bars, restaurants, museums and libraries which had been allowed to open since May 30 no longer had to enforce one or two metre distancing zones, one-way systems or collect customers contact details for possible track and tracing. All of that rigmarole was scrapped as the Visit Guernsey website declared: “We are proud to be the first place in the British Isles declared coronavirus free.”As Alex Lock, the nightclub owner (pictured below), prepared to unlock his club doors for the first time in three months he said he had hired extra security and bar staff in anticipation of up to 1,000 people turning up for the coronavirus-free party.“I did decide to open a little bit earlier to ensure I was the first nightclub to open,” he said. “This will be bigger than the Saturday before Christmas. People will probably get a little bit over excited and order a few more drinks than they would normally.“There will be no tourists, not even any ‘yachties’ from France. But, everyone on the island knows each other, so it will be a meeting up of friends. There are definitely going to be some on the pull though.”Guernsey, which has a population of about 65,000 people, went into lockdown on March 25, just after detecting its first case of community transmission of the virus. Inhabitants have nothing but praise for the deputies - or politicians - from the States of Guernsey government who set out a clear map to defeat the virus and return to “business as usual”. The sixth and final phase will see the two-week quarantine for visitors tourists lifted, although no date has yet been set for when that is possible. The island had only 13 Covid-19 deaths. It has been 52 days since the last case was detected. Deputy Gavin St Pier, Guernsey’s chief minister who gave the government briefings about their six phase plan, said closing the borders early, boosting their testing capacity as well as tackling care homes experiencing clusters of cases had been the key to success.  “Life is back to normal in what we call the island bubble of Guernsey,” he said, diplomatically refusing to comment on how “other jurisdictions” - such as the British government - had handled the virus. “Clearly being an island is helpful,” he said. “We locked down our borders on March 19 and imposed a 14 day quarantine to visitors. That was the single most important step. Then on March 25, after the first case of community transmission was detected, we locked down the entire island.”He added how “constant, clear and consistent messages” helped carry the islanders  along with them, although he admitted there were bound to have been mistakes and lessons that can be learned. At the Balthazar Bar and Restaurant, now open to full capacity, staff celebrated reaching Phase Five of lifting lockdown by wearing specially printed Tee-shirts bearing the slogan, ‘Five … is the magic number’.“I thought it would be September or October before we got to stage five,” said Steve Le Poidevin, the restaurant owner. “I think the island is really proud of itself for having done so well.”On Friday, the Beau Sejour Leisure Centre issued a jubilant press release announcing how it will become the first public community leisure complex in the British Isles to return to “business as usual” on Monday.Like most schools and colleges, the leisure centre opened partially in early June with strict social distancing rules, including asking swimmers to arrive wearing their swimming costumes and to change at the poolside.Matt Fallaize, local politician and president of the committee for education, sport and culture, could barely contain his glee. “The fact the centre is gearing up for normal opening at a time when leisure centres in other parts of the British Isles continue to struggle and remain closed is a great testament to the fantastic Guernsey together community spirit that has been demonstrated throughout this pandemic.”Even the Guernsey organisers of yesterday’s first Black Lives Matters march had abandoned plans for an earlier protest after accepting warnings that mass gatherings with limited social distancing could jeopardise reaching Phase Five. Contact sports including rugby and football clubs can now resume, although teams are governed still by associations that have not lifted UK-wide restrictions. But if the Guernsey Raiders Rugby Football Club wanted to clash with old rivals they would find teams on the UK mainland are a long way from lifting lockdown.Steve Melbourne, director of Island Rugby Guernsey at Guernsey Rugby Association, said: “The issue is we can’t go to the UK to play and you can’t get teams to Guernsey because they would have to have 14 days quarantine,” he said. “Rugby is a sociable sport. It’s been difficult for the guys to not be able to get together. We’ve missed simple things like shaking hands.”Chris Gnapp, sponsorship director at the club, said he remained “hopeful” the new season will start in September but ‘contact training’ was going ahead in preparation for a sevens rugby tournament between local teams in August.On Monday, some 175 children will attend the first academy training session run by the Guernsey Football Association, with competitive friendly matches likely to commence on July 1. Guernsey FA’s chief executive, Gary Roberts, added: “There is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm about beginning to resume football from players of all ages, as well as among coaches, referees and club officials.”Back at the nightclub, Mr Lock explains how not since World War II when the island was occupied by the Nazi Germans had pubs, clubs and restaurants been closed. “I guess we were under occupation from a virus.

It was only about four feet down and I saw this tiny fragment sticking about a quarter of an inch out of the mud.So I dug away and after 20 minutes out came this beautiful example of the period... To think it is older than Stonehenge, Callanish and the pyramids is just fantastic.I have been in touch with archaeologists from Southampton and Reading universities who are very excited about it.”Mr Murray also recovered 40 shards of pottery from the loch.Archaeologists in Scotland have made astounding discoveries in the islands\u0027 lochs in recent years.Mr Murray has previously scoured Loch Arnish, Loch Langabhat and Loch Borgastail on Lewis and made a number of finds.It shows that people were building these islands long before the pyramids and Stonehenge. It really is startling what we are finding out.These man made islands were clearly very important to early Hebrideans. Some of the pottery is now even called Hebridean Ware. Some of the bowls were scallop shaped and even the rims were decorated.The archaeologists don\u0027t know why they were throwing these pots into the loch nearly 6000 years ago - was it a sacrifice to water gods? I just decided to e on them out of curiosity and I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes - on some lochs it was full of pottery. It was incredible - a real archaeological treasure trove.The search was first sparked in 2011, when Mr Murray recovered a set of remarkably preserved Neolithic treasures submerged around a crannog.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expanded bubbles can reunite grandparents families","story":"Boris Johnson will announce an expansion of household “bubbles” on Tuesday that could mean millions more grandparents being reunited with their grandchildren.In a widespread easing of remaining lockdown measures, the Prime Minister will also put pubs, restaurants and hairdressers on notice to reopen on July 4 and cut the two metre rule to one metre. Staycations will also be opened up to millions of families.The move is designed to save tens of thousands of businesses from going under, and bring the country closer to normality than at any time since the lockdown started in March. It also has the potential to allow more schools to reopen before the summer.But Downing St said Mr Johnson “will not hesitate to put the handbrake on” if the virus starts spreading again, and that the new easements would be first in line to be reversed.Under current rules, any group of six people can meet in the open air, but the only people who can come closer than two metres are those living in the same household and one other nominated person who lives alone under a different roof.It has meant families having to make tough choices about which grandparent can hug their grandchildren or hold new-born babies.Mr Johnson is keen to find a way for more families to be reunited, and is studying different plans for expanding the current “support bubbles” policy that has allowed people living alone to link up with another household.One option is to allow two households to join together without any limit on numbers, though that would still mean couples having to choose between different sets of grandparents.Another option is to allow “bubbles” of a set number of people from more than two households, which would enable a family to have physical contact with both sets of grandparents. This option also has limits, as people with more than one set of grandchildren would still have to choose between them.A senior Government source said: “There will be an expansion of social bubbles but the details are still being finalised.”Another source said: “The question with bubbles has always been how you help families reunite to the maximum possible extent without too much risk.“The scientists’ main concern has always been infections spreading from one household to another, which is why this is one of the more difficult decisions we have to take.”Mr Johnson said on Sunday: “The disease is increasingly under control and I just want people to reflect on that important fact.“So, of course, as we make that progress it will be possible to open up more and you will be hearing more about what we want to do with not just non-essential retail but with the hospitality sector from July 4 and we’re sticking absolutely like glue to the road map to the plan that I set out on May 10.”Mr Johnson will today be given the recommendations of a Government review into the two metre rule, which is expected to conclude that it should be cut to one metre as long as it can be mitigated with face coverings, perspex screens or other measures.On Tuesday he will discuss the issue with his Cabinet before making a statement to Parliament on the latest easing of lockdown.A Downing Street source said: “The reason we are able to move forward this week is because the vast majority of people have taken steps to contain the virus. The more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing rules. “We will not hesitate to put the handbrake on to stop the virus running out of control.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"interviewchristian bruckner best friend sure took madeleine","story":"The former best friend of the man suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann says he is sure that the German paedophile took the young girl.In an extraordinary interview with the , Michael Tatschl, an Austrian drifter who lived with Christian Brückner in Portugal said he has sat down with police and told them all about his “sick” and “perverted” friend, who used to brag about his criminal exploits.Now, he has urged Brückner to “admit it to the police and close it for good.”With striking neck tattoos, a close cropped haircut and a large piercing on his left nipple, Tatschl spent years travelling across Europe living in camper vans.Speaking from his home outside Graz, Austria, where he has finally settled, the 46-year-old is adamant. I know he did it,” he claims.“I was living with him at the time. He was my best friend and he was definitely a pervert and more than capable of snatching a child, for sexual kicks or money.I was sure it was him the minute the police came to find me in Austria. They were very clear with me from the first minute. They said \u0027we are investigating Maddie McCann and Christian Brückner’ and I told them I knew it already. I was convinced it was him.”Speaking for the first time about his old friend, Tatschl described how he became involved with Brückner in Portugal in the early 2000s.The pair lived together, drank together and ultimately committed crimes together.I was staying at his house and camping in a van in the garden. We spent a lot of time together and had good fun.But he was definitely quite a strange character.“He was always quite criminal. He liked to brag about the crimes he had done and planned to do, and how he aimed to steal as much money as he could until he reached his dream of having €1 million. Then he would stop.It was rich pickings there in Praia da Luz. He was always breaking into apartments in the area and bragging about it to me,” Tatschl claimed.“He was a very good burglar and would easily climb up to first floor apartments when tourists were out.He would climb up to the first floor and steal everything, lots of money, valuables and so many passports. In fact hundreds of passports and lots of watches. Rolexes and other expensive watches.He had a hiding place in the house in the rafters in the roof. He had all the money and passports hidden up there, Tatschl claimed.”The property in question is a farmhouse just outside Praia da Luz which Brückner rented from a British man. Neighbours said he used to race down the dusty gravel track in his Jaguar and have heated shouting matches with a string of girlfriends. Tatschl said Brückner was in a relationship with a German woman 20 years his senior at the time.It is also where a camcorder was discovered that allegedly had footage of Brückner raping a 72-year-old tourist at a luxury villa in 2005. The video was destroyed, but the testimony of the two men who saw it helped convict Bruckner of the crime last year.“That’s how I found out he was a sick b******.“It was of this elderly lady who was chained to a wooden post and she was being beaten and raped.”“But I admit I got sucked into some of his schemes,” said Tatschl.Taking fuel seemed pretty harmless and we did it for a few months.The cops caught us red handed, caught us stealing diesel and we got eight-and-a-half months in prison on remand waiting for a trial in Portimao.It\u0027s just a small prison, so we got to spend a lot of time together.”In 2006, while the pair were in jail, the farmhouse was robbed, and the money, valuables and camcorder was taken.The father-of-one says he “cannot believe” that Portuguese detectives have not yet searched the former home they shared.When the pair were released from prison, Brückner moved into the distinctive white and yellow VW Westfalia campervan, while Tatschl says he left Portugal for Orgiva, Spain.He had lost the house but he was still enjoying living in the area. I think that confused the police a little as they were not sure where he was living exactly when Maddie vanished,” said Tatschl.The next time I saw him was in late May or early June 2007 and he arrived in Spain with his big American campervan, the Winnebago, the one with the swimsuits.He parked it up in Orgiva and came looking for me. It was the only reason he had come to Orgiva to find me. He knew that I was living there and he knew I had connections to the marijuana world and could help him make money.We all wondered where he’d got the money from.I remember specifically having a conversation with an English guy who lived there and we both said how on earth could have had that vehicle? “We assumed a big drug deal or something like that. Now I suspect it was Maddie.He was only there that time for a couple of days and went on back to Germany selling marijuana.”Brückner has a string of convictions, ranging from molesting a six-year-old girl in a playground when he was just a teenager, to raping a 72-year-old American woman in a horrific attack in Praia da Luz more than a decade later.Now, he has been identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. German authorities say they have evidence that she is dead, and that Brückner “did the deed” but they do not have enough evidence to charge him.He was definitely a pervert and all his friends thought that about him. He had some sexual issues but we didn’t think that he liked young children,” says Tatschl.Christian was always on the dark web. He would talk about it and he always had internet in the houses he rented.I don’t know exactly what he did but I suspect it involved drugs and pornography.He was always bragging about money and making money. He even talked about selling kids maybe to Morocco.I didn\u0027t really think about it at the time. Just brushed it off as joking.”Things changed when he watched an eight-part series on the McCann case in March last year.When I saw the Netflix documentary I knew immediately that he was guilty.The part where the female tourist talked about the man turning up at her door while her child played by the front door, the creepy guy with acne and blonde hair. I just knew it was Christian for sure.”Days later, police arrived at Tatschl’s front door.“I had two Austrian police and two German Police turn up at my house. I was then taken to the police station where I told them my story over 14 hours.It was the first week of April last year and they had me in the police station from 10am to 6pm on the first day and then from 10 am until 4pm the next day.They were very clear with me from the first minute.

From EM Forster (“If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country”) to the Spice Girls (“Friendship never ends!”) friendship is the sacred cow of sentiment.You can disown your daughter, put your dad in a home, have a vendetta with your twin and still be accepted in society. But say “I don\u0027t want to be friends with you any more” and you’ll be shunned as a sociopath.Be that as it may, I got a taste for it during Brexit. My friend, the novelist Jane Robins, had actually been chucked out of her book group for being a Brexiteer, and we had great fun making this into a play. I also made the most delightful new Brexiteer friends, which left me happy to let old acquaintance be forget without waiting for New Year’s Eve. When I heard the Marie Kondo expression “Does it spark joy?” said of possessions, it seemed an even more sensible question to ask of pals.I don’t want to live in an echo chamber – but neither do I want to share a padded cell with people who stick their fingers in their ears and practice “selective stupidity”, be they anti-racist friends who choose to ignore completely the Black Lives Matter movement’s anti-Semitic streak, or young people who seem to believe it is acceptable to monster JK Rowling for speaking the facts about biology. They’re not interested in the truth they’d rather close off their minds than think honestly.Jonathan Haidt, in his book The Righteous Mind, shows how we form opinions and then look for facts to back them up. As our political reality becomes ever more extreme, he says, people do more of this in order to stay in with their chosen crowd. Thus the most blinkered people right now are the bourgeois Woke who seek to ban everything rather than think about anything, ramping up their selective stupidity literally by the hour – now The Wombles, now statues, now Swing Low Sweet Chariot – while the most open-minded are the working class, who are resisting Wokeness and shunning it for what it is, what Marx would have called out as a ruling ideology.There are only a couple of people in anyone’s life who provides them with something irreplaceable you recognise them because when you’re getting on well with them you feel both excited and calm but when you fall out with them you feel both jumpy and leaden. For the rest of them, friends come into our lives to teach us about ourselves but they also leave for the same reason. Over the past fortnight I’ve learned that I can’t forgive people for putting their supposed morals before logic.One of the main tenets of Stoicism is to look at oneself unflinchingly. My favourite thinker, the ex-slave Epictetus, said, “If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer: ‘He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone’” – and you’ll note I’ve drawn attention to my own folly in the first sentence of this column. Until we can see ourselves as others see us, and in turn see what others see, we are un-thinkers, snow-blind with our own vanities.I voted for Brexit against my own interests as a rootless politan as I could not understand how a corrupt foreign bureaucracy could be good at running a small, dynamic nation. Similarly, when it comes to Black Lives Matter or the trans debate, what really riles me is not my own interest but the thought of all those people who are having their interests ignored by would-be allies who’d rather look cool.As the great Peter Ustinov once said, “I do not believe that friends are necessarily the people you like best they are merely the people who got there first.” This may put the wind up the weak-minded, but as a very entertaining meritocrat, I’m all for it. If you love someone, set them free – and if they’re selectively stupid, make sure it stays that way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/21/23/ipanema-beach.jpg","title":"coronavirus cases daily record global world health organisation","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Total number of global infections stands at 8.7mThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Matt Hancock has spoken out about why he broke his own social distancing rules this week, after video footage from inside the House of Commons showed him reaching past yellow hazard tape used to keep politicians two metres apart — and patting someone on the back as he walked into the chamber.When asked about the incident by Nick Robinson, filling in for Mr Marr on the BBC’s weekly political programme The Andrew Marr Show, the health secretary said: “It was just totally natural. This shows how difficult social distancing is. I know these rules inside out.“I hadn’t seen my colleague for weeks and I really like him!” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen probed by Mr Robinson, who suggested anyone watching the video might feel “it’s one rule for you and one rule for somebody else”, Mr Hancock apologised, saying: “I’m incredibly sorry for this momentary breach — it’s because I’m human.”Mr Hancock himself has already contracted and recovered from the virus once, having displayed mild symptoms at the same time Boris Johnson was hospitalised in March.Scientists believe there is a likelihood those infected will carry some immunity — however, there is so far no conclusive evidence that someone who has contracted the virus is unable to catch it again.Government to announce further lockdown easing this week, Hancock saysThe health secretary also confirmed to Mr Robinson that the government will “bring forward proposals” to reduce the two-metre social distancing rule. He said: “The proposals we’ll bring forward are how you can safely reduce the two metre with the sort of mitigations we’ve been talking about.”But while Mr Hancock said he “very much hopes” to reduce the distance, he also said the government would only make changes “in a way that is safe and doesn’t lead to a resurgence of the virus”.As it stands, the guidance from Mr Hancock’s department still clearly states that the public “should keep two metres apart from people not in your household or support bubble at all times”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is something her devoted husband, Scott Mitchell, has been dreading.The couple married in  with some cynics snfily declaring it would never last, mainly because of the -year age gap, but Scott proved them all completely wrong.He adores his we and has put his le on hold, and his physical and mental health at risk, to take care of his Barbara.Scott has also helped to raise funds and awareness for dementia charities, even taking part in the London Marathon with a group of Barbara’s friends from EastEnders.It has been deeply sad to see how this disease has ravaged one of the most delightful women in showbiz.I always adored interviewing Barbara. She was sunny, funny, full of fascinating stories and always interested in everyone and everything.She would have a laugh with the crew, a cheery chat with our production team and was exactly the same whether the cameras were rolling or not.I know a lot of famous actors and entertainers who are grumpy gits until the red light goes on. Barbara was never like that. She is a consummate professional, but also a delightfully warm human being.I remember seeing her at an event in London, where she was swamped by photographers and members of the public. She’s so tiny I couldn’t actually see her in that large sea of people, but what I did observe was how everyone came away with an autograph or a selfie.Barbara is old school. She always said she owes her fame to the public and that they deserved a smile, a cheery wave and a quick photograph.That’s why she is so adored and why we are so very upset she is having to go through this anguish. Scott says her speech is growing worse and she now struggles to find the words to express herself.She ends up sitting shaking her head in sadness and frustration. Barbara is also getting up two or three times a night, becoming unsteady on her feet and falling over. Scott is worried sick that she will suffer a really serious injury.Sometimes Barbara looks at old photos of herself and asks, “Who is she ” and increasingly she doesn’t recognise Scott, which cuts him to his very heart and soul.This disease is so brutal, because it chips away at the sufferer, steals their memories and erodes what makes them unique. You gradually lose the person you love and have to mourn them while they are still alive. That’s why the work both Scott and Barbara have been doing is so vital.When she bravely told us she was ill two years ago, the Alzheimer’s Society saw visits to its website double and one-off donations to the charity rose by  per cent.She made a plea to the PM to help carers and sufferers, and to increase funding, and Barbara was one of the few people that made Boris Johnson stop waffling and actually listen.Dementia is a second epidemic within this pandemic, which is why we need more documentaries like the ones from Ross.There are , sufferers that we know about in the UK, and with us all living longer that number will carry on increasing.Relatives caring for those blighted by the disease can often feel alone and helpless. GPs and the NHS do their best, but it can be a lottery as to what expert care is available.As we have seen during this crisis, care home workers are an extraordinary group of people who treat their frail and elderly patients like a second family, but no one really wants to put a beloved parent or partner into a nursing home.There comes a time, however, when there is no other choice. Scott is now facing that prospect and it is tearing him apart. I also spoke this week to the musician Naughty Boy, whose mum Zahida suffers from dementia.He is a devoted son and lives with his mum to take care of her. Naughty Boy is backing Dementia UK’s Lives On Hold campaign, which focuses on carers and how draining it is for them, especially since lockdown. He wants to stress that there is help out there. I was touched at how he makes sure there is at least one thing every day for his mum to look forward to, to give her joy.He tries to see some light in the darkness and it’s also something Scott has always tried to do. He has to be Barbara’s memory and keep a hold of the love they have for one another.Eventhey have to be parted so she can go into a home, nothing can take that love away from him or anyone  going through the same sad experience.IF you are going to quote Game Of Thrones, then for the love of God at least get it right.Tone deaf Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed those who support the Black Lives Matter campaign by taking a knee, as seeming to “get the idea from Game Of Thrones”.This was not only hugely insulting, but Raab didn’t even bother to get the phraseology right. In Game Of Thrones, the characters are willing to die before they would BEND the knee in front of despots and royalty.In the real world it’s about expressing solidarity against racial inequality.Raab believes the heartfelt gesture is a “symbol of subjugation and subordination” and he would only do so for the Queen and his we. Those who take the knee, including footballers at theof the Premier League this week, and many protesters here and in the US, were astounded by his crass remarks.Following such wide­spread incredulity and anger, Raab has been furiously back-tracking. I do hope his Twitter clarication is genuine and not just another Government damage-limitation tactic.If this really was an episode of Game Of Thrones, he would have had his a*** handed to him by my favourite character, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound.After that encounter, I guarantee he would never again be able to bend any part of his anatomy.HOLLYOAKS actor Adam Rickitt is an astonishingly candid and brave man. He not only spoke about his mental health at a time when it was considered career-destroying, but has talked frankly this week about being infertile.Adam suffers from an auto-immune disease that has made it impossible for him to ever father children. The -year-old has ankylosing spondylitis, which has had a devastating effect on his sperm count.While other men might have felt embarrassed about it, Adam has been refreshingly honest. He revealed the doctor told him most men have three million sperm, but he only had two. Not two million but TWO.He and his we Katy Fawcett, a top correspondent with Good Morning Britain, are very happy with their three dogs. Adam has been equally upfront about his mental health and suicidal thoughts. Since meeting Katy in  his le has turned around and, alongside acting jobs, he’s running a craft beer bar and shop. The couple call it their “baby”.They adore each other and are lucky to feel complete without kids.GWYNETH PALTROW’S latest attention- seeking wheeze is to bring out a candle that “smells of her orgasm”.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mums.And when you are responsible for home-educating your children as well as working out how to feed them three meals a day while holding down your job and everything  you used to do before children went to school at home, there is a strong incentive to get those schools open. And quick.Perhaps less so when someone  is taking care of all that stuff for you.Getting our classrooms back up and running may well take a bit of lateral thought, because of course it has to be safe to do so. But on the basis we can now pop to Zara or Ikea, surely we can open our schools safely Few disagree that lockdown should have included schools, but they need to open as soon as it is safe to do so.Yes, these things all need proper managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help them with the logistics and arrangements To socially distance safely, we may need to cut class sizes in half and have twice as many classrooms, so why not look to use dferent spaces, for example empty community halls, empty libraries, empty offices etc.What about outdoor learning in small groups If we cut classrooms by half we will need twice as many teachers.So how about encouraging unemployed graduates to work as teaching assistants Or asking retired teachers to come out of retirement, just as many nurses did at the beginning of the pandemic.You know you can find the solution when it’s your problem to solve. Which is why any government and any Cabinet should be as representational of “real le” as possible, which is why we need more women advising the Prime Minister.That said, no doubt many women just don’t fancy a le in politics. When you look at the abuse, death treats, and sexism they face, who can blame them.But unless there are people from all walks of le — including women — in the Cabinet, then the issues that affect real people will not be properly tackled or solved.Just look at the incredible effect that some of the world’s female leaders have had when they’ve acted swtly and decisively in the face of Covid-.Germany’s Angela Merkel has kept deaths in her country down to just  per million — compared to  per million in the UK.New Zealand’s inspiring Jacinda Ardern has overseen a remarkable response to the pandemic which involved a rapid, draconian lockdown.Only  people died there. She has been widely praised for her strength in leadership.These daily UK Government press briefings have made it all too clear that we are crying out for more women at the helm.The steady stream of menfielding questions on the topics of the day has been alarming. Priti Patel’s appearances could be counted on one hand.It does make you wonder whether we’d be in a healthier positionmore women had been given more prominence in Boris’s Cabinet.I think we would be.Until recently, many people knew Maya Jama as the girlfriend of rapper Stormzy, but they broke up as a couple last year.What people are now gradually realising is that she has had a fantastic career in her own right – and she proved it last week when she stole the show while co-presenting Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer on BBC.And it wasn’t because her low-cut top, inset, raised a few eyebrows, though certainly not mine.As she rightly pointed out, she can dress how she pleases.She stole the show because she is good at what she does and is engaging.At the age of  she has already done a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio , and now she is presenting Saturday night TV.Andit weren’t for Covid- she would be acting in her first film around about now too.Plus, as a sideline she is launching a skincare range and has a mysterious big project brewing – rumoured by some to be Strictly Come Dancing.In fact, she said in an interview this week that lockdown is the first time since she was  that she has had such an extended rest .All of this would be impressive for any -year-old but way more so when you know that Maya’s father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. And not only that – in  when she was , her then boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting.These are the kind of le experiences that can lead young people down a very dferent track to the one that Maya has put herself on, and for that alone she deserves our admiration.But really we should admire her solely because she is so good at what she does, and such a brave and eloquent voice for her generation.Kate Ferdinand has announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband of nine months Rio.It really could not happen to a nicer or more deserving couple, as evidenced by the fact that when they told Rio’s three children – Lorenz, , Tate, , and nine-year-old Tia – the youngsters jumped up and down with joy.That is the reaction of children who have been made to feel happy, secure and, above all, loved by their father and his new we, despite having gone through the pain of losing their mother.Kate put the video on Instagram with the caption: “The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier . . . every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.”Good luck to them.About bloody time.This is an opportunity to be seized.If we think carefully about how to spend the money in the right way, we can achieve a great deal of good in this country – and God knows we need that right now.I am sure I’m not the only one having mixed feelings about shops reopening and the huge step back towards “normality” that we all took this week.On the one hand it feels like a huge relief.Thank goodness things are moving again.On the other, I’m a bit worried about how to get out of my pyjamas, start wearing make-up and navigate my working wardrobe again.On balance, though, I’m excited for us to all start doing what we can to get the economy growing again.Talking of shops reopening, I didn’t enjoy the level of scorn being heaped by people on social media on to the huge queues outside Primark stores, which re-opened on Monday.I think before they are so judgmental they should stop for a minute and consider that many people do not have credit cards so cannot shop online.But not only that – say what you like about Primark clothes, one thing they are is cheap.Families with kids who have grown out of their gear over lockdown couldn’t wait to get in there to grab what they needed, and there was a distinctly snobbish element to some people’s judgment.They should think before they speak.Photos of Reese Witherspoon running in a baseball cap with her face concealed by a mask made me realise celebs everywhere – especially those with lockdown hair and faces that might need a bit of  TLC – are seeing this season’s new must-have accessory as an opportunity to conceal a multitude of sins.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean.

No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It also won’t bail them out.The BBC said the decision was still under review at the moment and no decisions had yet been made.The new scheme is expected to cost the Beeb £million - £ million less than it would bethe current scheme had been extended.It was estimated that the total cost would have reached £ million a year - equivalent to around a fth of the BBC’s spending on services.After August only one million pensioners who get pension credit will be allowed to get their licence for free - a move which has sparked outrage among MPs.Julian Knight, a Conservative MP and chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: “If this is postponed, it will be welcome to the millions of Britons who faced losing their TV licence in the middle of a pandemic.“I would hope any further delay would give the government and the BBC an opportunity to come together and thrash out a settlement to ensure that free TVs are retained for the remainder of the charter period [until ].” A BBC spokesperson said:The BBC has made no such decision and it is wrong to suggest we have.

But in the background, people on legacy benefits—including disabled people, carers and people with young families—have slipped down the list of priorities. It’s now time for the Government to redress that balance and increase legacy benefits too. It’s simply not right for people to miss out on support just because they happen, through no fault of their own, to be claiming the ‘wrong’ kind of benefit. And they demanded that people who are not allowed to claim benefits or other help due to their immigration statue have the rule suspended during the pandemic.Thousands of people who legally live and work in the UK are left unable to get helpthey lose their jobs.And they can struggle to get access to domestic violence help too.Labour MP Jess Phillips is campaigning to end the discrimination of no recourse to public funds and is fighting to change the law.Speaking to The Sun last week she said: “Domestic violence abusers dont discriminate, so we have to make sure our domestic violence laws do not discriminate.”Immigrant women can only access the schemetheir visa is tied to their spouse - and lasts for three months.Ms Philips hopes to see the scheme extended for six months, and opened up to women on student visa, work visas and ever tourist visas.She said: “It shouldnt matter -you have just been beaten up or your le has been threatened, and you go to a police station, they should be able to say there is somewhere for you to go where you will be safe, no matter who you are, no matter where you come from.” Mr Timms added People whose immigration status leaves them with no recourse to public funds have been left with no support from the benefits system at all—and at risk of destitution and homelessness. Some have had to face the invidious choice between staying at home and facing financial ruin, for themselves and their children, or going to work and risking spreading the disease. The Government must suspend these rules for the duration of the pandemic.A DWP spokesperson said: “We rolled out measures that could be quickly and effectively put into place and that benefited those facing the most financial disruption.“There have been more than . million new claims for Universal Credit since  March and the system has stood up to the test in a way which the paper-based legacy benefit system could not have, ensuring around % of people are paid in full and on time.“We have made a number of changes to legacy and other working age benefits, such as increasing certain entitlements such as Local Housing Allowance, and introduced a range of additional measures to provide financial protection for those affected by COVID-, including those with no recourse to public funds.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So there is a balance to be found between taking all reasonable precautions, including social-distancing, hand-washing and wearing a mask in confined spaces — everyone is familiar with what they should be doing against the potential risk.Yes, there is risk — but le has risk andyou don’t want any risk at all, stay at home.Butyou want to go out or you have to go back out, let me help you manage your fears.Some people are frightened to go back to work because they don’t know what kind of world to expect. Others fear having to use public transport. And there is another set of people who have got out of their daily work routine and lost their motivation and drive after sitting on the couch, watching endless TV boxsets.If you have an overwhelming anxiety at the thought of travel to work, or fear about what the world is going to be like, then my simple techniques can help you navigate the new normal calmly and confidently. I cannot take away coronavirus, but I can help you to reduce your anxiety and stress so that it doesn’t overpower you and spoil your le.THIS troubleshooting technique is fantastic because it helps you instantly control feelings of anxiety and panicyou feel overwhelmed by the thought of going out.It is used by all isions of the American military and they teach it to service personnel for when they are in situations that may seem overwhelming, such as battles.Soyou are about to do your journey to work or use public transport and feel yourself starting to freak out, here’s how to manage your feelings.Simply putting your hand on your heart moves your attention there and that in turn reduces stress hormones such as cortisol.Also, people who are tense and stressed do not breathe correctly, and when you breathe properly it affects your neuro-physical state.Breathe in slowly and out slowly three times in a row.Remember a time you felt really good — it could be when you fell in love, or were laughing with friends or enjoying a great holiday.Put yourself back into that moment now. Float into your body, asyou were there, and remember the sounds, smells and feelings you had.Because the human nervous system does not know the dferences between real and vividly imagined experiences, it transports you back there and changes your state.Now imagine your heart can speak to you.Ask your heart how you can take better care of yourself in that moment.You might get an inner sense that tells you to relaxyou are doing too much — any number of dferent things.You are talking to your inner self — your unconscious mind — when you do that. It may come to you as an image, you may hear an internal dialogue or you may get a feeling.I actually practised this yesterday, and I have to say my inner self does have a sense of humour because sometimes I get a bizarre abstract image — which I get wrapped up in before I understand it. But it is very hard to remain stressed once you have done that.THE more often we repeat a pattern of behaviour, the stronger it becomes.When we indulge in negativity over the years, we hardwire ourselves to be negative. One of these patterns is catastrophising about a perceived threat, suffering anxiety or being paralysed by fear. When I went through a dficult time following the loss of my father, I used a “negativity fast” all the time.It will help you create a future you want to move towards, by letting go of irrational fear.For the rest of the week, you are going to starve yourself of negativity and retrain yourself to be more positive instead.This process alone will  re-write the operating software of your mind and, as well as helping you now, will also serve you well for the rest of your le. For the next week, when-ever you feel bad about anything, stop what you are doingand follow these five easy steps . . . Notice what image, sound or words come to mind. By that, I mean literally listen to your inner voice. It might be hard at first but it gets easier with practice. Remember, your emotions are like signals, letting you know when you need to pay extra attention to some aspect of your experience. Every feeling in your body is linked to an internal picture or  sound, or by the words that you say to yourself  in your mind.Negative emotions are just messengers sent by your mind and body to  let you know it is time to  pay attention to something. For example,I have a worrying feeling and I stop and notice, what comes to mind is the image of an upcoming meeting. My mind is trying to alert  me to things that might go wrong  in that meeting and make sure I am well prepared.So, in our example, I might make a list of all the things I can do to stop those problems occurring and take action on at least one of them.This is like hanging up the phone or resetting the smoke alarm. When I’ve heeded my mind’s warning, I drain all the colour out of the image, shrink it down to the size of a postage stamp and send  it off into the distance. If the picture pops back, it’s because there’s still something you need to be aware of, so find out what it is by repeating this process.Finally, imagine events go exactly the way you want them to. In the example of my upcoming meeting, I make a big, bright mental movie of the meeting going perfectly and watch it all the way through to the happy ending.POWER postures come from a scientic experiment at Hard University where researchers found that because the mind and body are linked, when you pull certain postures with your body, this affects your mindset for the better.A group was asked to undergo a gruelling interview.The only preparation was to do some power postures beforehand.The most successful, confident and self-assured in the interview were the people who had tried the power postures.I recommend you do all three of the postures I’ll describe at the start of each day, when you get up. You will engage with your day better, as you are putting yourself into a better physiological state.If you need a little “top up” you can do them again before a stressful meeting or event.Find somewhere quiet to do this in advance of that meeting or situation — to empower yourself.It may seem strange but it works, so try it for yourself.I use this method myself before going on stage or before a key meeting — it’s all about dealing with the anxiety and fear that holds us back. It may seem odd at first but research proves these postures work. As you hold each position think only about how it makes you feel. It literally sets your day up for success.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One teacher refused to use my name at registration. Instead they called me Jungle Bunny every day. That affected my learning.”Now  and a celebrated writer and poet, Khadijah is today marking Windrush Day — highlighting the historic occasion in  when hundreds of Caribbean immigrants disembarked from the passenger liner Empire Windrush  at Tilbury, Essex, to plug the labour gap here following World War Two and help rebuild the country.Those pioneers  years ago were the first of a thousands-strong ­Windrush generation who sailed here from the Caribbean until the early Seventies, when immigration laws became tighter.Khadijah said: “It’s important to honour the contribution of the Windrush generation to British society. Windrush Day is as important as Remembrance Day or clapping for the NHS, as we have done during the pandemic.”Khadijah, who works for the Geraldine Connor Foundation on a Windrush educational project, adds: “The African-Caribbean community has made a huge contribution, from the arts to technology, nursing, engineering and science. “I think of Una Marson, the first black woman broadcaster at the BBC Jamaican poet Claude McKay, whose words were quoted by Winston Churchill during World War Two of Beryl Gilroy, London’s first black headteacher.  “But each of us in the African-Caribbean community has contributed to British culture.”Khadijah’s -year-old mother, Gloria McLaren, came to Leeds from Jamaica in , aged , and still lives in the city. Khadijah says: “Mum was excited to come to this ‘strange land’. She travelled with a friend but was quite disappointed because they had come from an island filled with sun and England was cold.“Her first impression of Leeds was that it was filled with ‘factories’.“Those turned out to be terrace houses with chimneys. She had never seen a coal fire before.”Gloria had not planned to stay permanently but went on to have five children here. Le was far from easy, though. Khadijah says: “She worked in all sorts of jobs, whatever she could, before training as a mental-health nurse. There was a lot of racism, often very threatening. She would get called names in the street and Teddy boys would chase her. You had to know the best way to get home quick, and steer clear of certain areas.”But Khadijah, now a mother of three and gran of one, says: “I was surrounded by great teachers in my family. “My grandparents on my dad’s side, Lucilda and Trevor Winter, came from Jamaica in the late Fties and were activists for social change.“Lucilda was a nurse who also set up the first pre-school for black kids in Leeds. My grandad helped set up education-equality campaign group The Brotherhood. Luckily, Khadijah’s family were not affected by the Windrush scandal in , which saw  hundreds of British citizens who came here between  and  wrongly detained and even deported. It led to a government compensation scheme. But Khadijah says: “I remember, in the s, my mother sorting her papers for her right to stay here. She was lucky to know educated people, like lawyers, and knew the importance of it. In , many of her generation who had not sorted their documents were caught up in the Windrush scandal.”On Sunday, Khadijah and daughter Rheima Ibrahiim-Robinson spoke at a Black Lives Matter rally in Leeds’ Hyde Park. Leeds University student Rheima, , says: “A lot of younger people do not know about Windrush. Even I didn’t know the politics. But Windrush Day helps because people might understand immigrants more and how they have contributed.”Khadijah adds: “It’s sad we still talk about racial inequality. But the more we recognise Britain’s history, and African-Caribbean people’s contributions, the more we will move toward a more equal, just society.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More deprived communities have populations likely to be more vulnerable to the health and social impacts of the Covid- pandemic, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says. Rates of mental illness are more than . times higher in the most deprived tenth than the least deprived tenth, and around twice as high in places such as Manchester and Hackney, London, than in Wokingham, Berks – the least deprived council in England. Child poverty and housing dficulties are also signicantly higher in more deprived parts of England. IFS research economist Kate Ogden said: Where councils serving more deprived areas look more at risk is the vulnerability of their residents to the impacts of the crisis on health and wellbeing given high pre-existing prevalence of mental ill health, housing dficulties, interactions with childrenaposs services and child poverty. This is likely to push up their spending needs into the longer term. Researchers urged the Government to consider easing borrowing rules for town halls. IFS associate director David Phillips said ministers “should bear the complex patterns of risk and resilience our report finds in mind when deciding its next steps with local government funding”. He added: “Big dferences in financial risk and signicant iation in the reserves councils hold mean the Government should also consider temporarily relaxing the rules that prevent councils from borrowing to cover day-to-day spending.  “If it does not, dficulty in targeting funding means it will either have to provide more funding to the sector as a whole than is necessary or step in to provide specic support for councils that are particularly struggling. “Otherwise there is the risk that some councils could have to impose restrictions on all but the most essential expenditure.

With the public mood turning away from lockdown, pubs were preparing to open early in July whatever No’s advice. The Covid- alert has gone from four to three, meaning transmission is no longer “high” but it is in “general circulation”. The World Health Organisation recommends at least m distancing and France, China, Denmark, and Singapore, Canada and Spain are also reviewing their m rule. Here, we look at the impact of a m rule. Pubs - easier to get a pint Britons have jumped the gun on lockdown easing and are enjoying drinks in beer gardens and outdoor seat areas. These young drinkers were pictured yesterday in King’s Cross in London. Pubs are desperate for rules to be relaxed to save many of the . million hospitality jobs under threat. Landlords have warned that m distancing between customers will make trading “unsustainable”. Easing the rule will mean more clientele, saving some of the , pubs under threat of never reopening. Table service, strict cleaning rotas and floor markings will be the norm. Beer gardens in the first pubs to open will be patrolled to enforce new rules from July . Restaurants - get more diners in  Bosses have pleaded for an end to the m rule so that they can get enough diners in to make some money. Cutlery will be brought out with food, menus will be disposable and waiters must wash their hands between every serving – or wear gloves. Plastic screens may be used and diner arrival times will be staggered. Schools - ready for full classes  A cut to m means schools can open with full classes of around  when the academic year starts in September. Boris Johnson said he was “sure” relaxing the distancing rule, with other health safeguards, would allow all schools to reopen that month. Classes will increase from  to normal as the size of teaching “bubbles” double. A change would also enable pupils to take up more quickly the benefits of the Government’s £ billion catch up on learning fund.couldn’t meet the m rule. Hand sanitiser will be used at the door. Nightclub openings could be put back as dancefloors pose a risk. Shops - increase the footfall  Relaxing the rule will be a leline for larger shops and chains, allowing up to double the footfall. Smaller shops will find it harder, but the change will give many outlets a better chance of survival as stores struggle to recoup losses of £.million a week in lockdown. Hairdressers are expected to reopen from July , with advice to avoid face-to-face chat and talk only about essentials, facing the mirror. Around , people work in hairdressing and beauty. Sports - fans in the stadium  Fans will benefit from a m distancing, with the possibility of limited access to fixtures such as big football games. Some sports, such as cricket, not cleared under the m rule, will resume as players can play closer to each other. Golfers - who were allowed back last month - may also have more rules relaxed.

In Angela Merkel, his country of birth has an Iron Chancellor displaying crucial leadership – while Britain is lumbered with an incompetent flip-flopper in Boris Johnson. Germany’s death rate, at  per one million people, is roughly one-sixth of our . Yet it was achieved without wrecking a fth of its economy. Our world-beating highest excess deaths, and the worst economic hit, are a double-whammy panicking a growing number of Tory MPs into contemplating le after a Johnson clowning on a clf-edge. Easing lockdown restrictions, reopening pubs and dismantling ­ludicrous quarantine is the easy part for the Prime Minister. Build, build, build a decent, fairer, prosperous country feels beyond the dithering architect of lost lives, with care home scandals, PPE shortages, missed testing targets, still-shut schools and an app that proved to be the square wheel of technology. Johnson prefers to slobber constantly over the future because he can’t justy the present or defend the past. Feeble economic growth and still-mounting debt before the plague, the NHS on a le-support system and education suffering a decade of austerity cuts were the Government’s dismal record. Labour is wrestling with how to stop slippery Johnson exploiting Covid- as a Year Zero moment a fresh start for him and the Tories. His party did it successfully last year by dumping Theresa May so Johnson, ex-Foreign Secretary and lobby fodder – who for years loyally joined assaults on working families – could run against the Tories’ own record. Johnson regenerating more often than Doctor Who is tougher in . Unless Labour nail him, the charlatan won’t care about the truth.The next election might be as far off as December  but Lib Dem potential leader Layla Moran floatinglocal pacts with Labour and also ruling out another ConDem coalition is signicant.Tactical voting is key when Keir Starmer must win  more seats to just be the biggest party.

Ministers should raise rates for “legacy benefits”, according to the Work and Pensions Committee. Chairman Stephen Timms said: “People on legacy benefits-including disabled people, carers and people with young families, have slipped down the list of priorities. “Itaposs now time for the Government to redress that balance and increase legacy benefits too. “Itaposs simply not right for people to miss out on support just because they happen, through no fault of their own, to be claiming the aposwrongapos kind of benefit.” In a report, the committee said it was unacceptable that people have been left to face hardship without the equivalent help simply because of the outdated and complex way in which so-called legacy benefits are administered.The system has been too inflexible and slow to adapt to support people during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the committee.Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Gillian Guy said we strongly urge the Government to accept the recommendations, warning itaposs been people in the most vulnerable circumstances whoaposve been hardest hit by the crisis.

The scheme would end the wait for a monthly wage and ease cashflow problems hitting millons during the Covid- pandemic. The proposal by ex-Labour Treasury minister Phil Woolas would mean you could use an employer’s payroll like a current bank account – instant access to your money but without any overdraft facility. Financial Secretary Jesse Norman now has the scheme in his in-tray. The Bank of England is interested in it and it’s backed by payroll providers covering . million employees. It will also be considered by the powerful Commons Treasury Select Committee looking for ways to help cash-strapped workers. Most companies pay monthly as it is more convenient to administer. But payroll advance technology means more frequent payments would cost just £ a month, most likely charged to the employee. Mr Woolas said: “Workers would rather have their money sooner, especially those struggling. The reality is most would opt to be paid weekly.  It could make the dference between keeping their heads above water and le on benefits.” Most common reasons for workers needing instant cash are unexpected household and car repairs or travel to help sick relatives. The scheme would end the need to turn to unscrupulous payday lenders. Half of UK workers do not have access to more than £ in cash.  Mr Woolas added: “This would put the legalised loan sharks out of business.” Mr Woolas has hooked up with financing techniques entrepreneur David Brown as part of a wider job protection scheme known as Toupay – an alternative to Mr Sunak’s taxpayer funded furlough safety net.

The letter reads: Abolishing one of the worldaposs most effective and respected government departments at a time when the world is in need of global leadership undermines our response to Covid- and suggests the UK is turning its back on the worldaposs poorest people. “It also risks us being less able to respond to the great challenges of our time, such as global health security and climate change. The charitiesapos letter adds: This decision, taken during a global pandemic with no consultation, ahead of the review of development, diplomacy and defence and against the recent advice of the cross-party International Development Select Committee, does not enhance our reputation in the world but diminishes it. Boris Johnson announced the axing of DfID last week in a move which delighted Conservative backbenchers.The closure of the department after  years has also come under criticism from opposition MPs and three former prime ministers, including the Conservative David Cameron.

Restrictions imposed to help stop the spread of the deadly virus has meant millions of Brits are now working from home. The number of cases and deaths rise every day, serving as a daily reminder of the suffering that the virus has caused. But as the UK prepares to ease restrictions, WalesOnline has spoken with some who don’t want it to end just yet. For those people, lockdown has been a chance to clear their head, pursue passions or rediscover lost hobbies. aposAs an introvert, this has been a dreamapos Ihsana Feldwick, , lives in Cardf after moving six months ago with her partner. Ihsana is of mixed heritage and has been a victim of racism on several occasions. Since lockdown, sheaposs been able to engage with the Black Lives Matter movement from home, which has been really important for her. I was born in Cambridgeshire, and am a mixed race girl of predominantly Bangladeshi, Jamaican, English and Portuguese heritage, and have never quite felt like I fit in any aposboxapos. The first time I’d ever questioned my skin tone or race was when I had moved to Cambridge from Luton, a hugely erse city, aged ten. I was the only mixed race girl in the entire year,not the entire school. I struggled to make friends and felt like an outsider, and I had experiences of when other kids would call me apospoo colouredapos. This was the catalyst which made me hate my skin colour for such a long time. When she was in year seven, Ihsana remembers walking to school and being racially abused by a man from the window of his car. She also used to be followed home from school by a group of children who would spit at her and call her brother a member of ISIS. I used to end up going to a friends house for a few hours before I went home to avoid them, or resorted to wearing an oversized hoodie with my hood up in the hopes they wouldn’t bother me, or notice me. Before the lockdown I was solely focused on just getting on with le, hence the move to Cardf last year, but with quarantine, the death of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, it has definitely given me time to reflect on my own experiences and made me want to do my best to help defeat racism, knowing how much of an issue it still is today. One of the books I’m reading has taught me a lot about apartheid, Trevor Noah’s Born A Crime: Short Stories From A South African Childhood. I have also spent a lot of my time posting videos which depict racism in today’s society, as well as petitions and links for people to educate themselves and donate to the movement and to those who need it. I just really hope that people listen. “I have gotten into art again and started drawing digitally which has definitely unlocked a creative side of me that I now want to incorporate into my career and future job. “The strange thing is that any routine has gone out the window and every day is dferent, with no real structure. Some days we won’t cook dinner. Other days we’ll incorporate a home work out or a walk along the Bay. “Despite the sporadic-ness of our lives, we have made it work and have really enjoyed what we have coined our own stay-at-home ‘summer holiday’. Ihsana said the break has been good in other ways too. As an introvert, this has been a dream. Before the lockdown, I felt the stress of having to make sure that any time I booked off had to be spent with family back in England, and felt sad that I couldn’t spend my time off just relaxing with my partner. Now I feel as though because of all this time I’ve got to spend with him, I won’t feel as guilty going home. As a girl in her mid-twenties, there’s a lot of pressure on going out and nightle and feeling like aposwe won’t be this young againapos. Lockdown has been a nice excuse not to bend to those pressures, not to mention a massive money saver, which is crucial right now for me as I am unemployed. “I don’t want to stay in the safe enclosure of my home, but for now it’s a comfort and I don’t feel as though I am ready for this aposnew normalapos and to start a whole new job, which I know will feel like an entirely dferent world. “I know I can’t live like this forever, and I really do want to get my career back on the road, but for now I’m happy being in the happy and safe bubble of my home. ‘I donapost remember the last time that I didnapost actually feel depressed before lockdown’ Michelle lives in Newport, and said the lockdown period has helped ease her mental health issues. Itaposs allowed me to spend more time training our puppy we got just before lockdown. Itaposs also allowed me the time to start improving, decorating and repairing our first house, which we moved into in October. “I work in a fairly stressful job, and I no longer feel the anxiety I used to feel every evening after work or on Sunday evenings before work. “I donapost feel the pressure to do everything that I want to do at all times now. I would constantly feel like I had to try to squeeze something meaningful out of every drop of my free time just to make myself feel better before the depression that I suffer around my work set back in again. “My depression has improved so much - I donapost remember the last time that I didnapost actually feel depressed, before lockdown that is. “Iaposve worked in the same job since uni - just over three years now - and I had no idea how unwell I felt every day, because it became my normal feeling. “Lockdown has given me perspective and distance. The pace of le has slowed right down and I feel more like I can enjoy and live le now, instead of just going through the motions and having le pass me by in a blur. Michelle said she understands the hurt felt by people separated from their friends and families, and that she keeps in touch with her family in England. “I feel like I can actually experience a lot of things now, and get a lot of things done, rather than brushing everything off as I donapost have time. I donapost want lockdown to end, but I hope that when it does we donapost lose the perspective we have all gained and I hope we donapost just go back to putting our heads down in our work and missing out on our lives. ‘I’ve turned my floristry hobby into a full-time gig’ Anita Mattson-Hesketh, , lives near Ely and has taken the chance to quit her job and follow her dream of starting a business. “Lockdown has changed my le! I’ve turned my floristry hobby into a full time gig, quit my office job of seven years and gone self employed, she said. “Floristry has been a hobby of mine for a couple of years now. My family are really keen gardeners, and it was going to a course in a flower school with my sister who was interested at that time that made me keep it up afterwards.  “I’d been working in finance as a mortgage advisor in Barry most recently and doing qualications in my spare time. “When lockdown happened I started doing bouquets for birthdays for people to buy and to keep busy, and it hasn’t stopped. “I had pretty much gotten everything I could out of my old job, and when they announced it was reopening I had to decide between the two, and handed in my notice a couple of weeks ago. “My manager was very understanding - this is something which now gives me a sustainable income and is a passion, you know.” Anita said her business started through being contacted by people for birthday bouquets, and has gone from strength to strength. “At first I thought lockdown would be like a sort of dry run, but it’s just gotten bigger. We do a lot of birthdays and have been dropping them outside the door, so there’s no contact involved. Iaposve also started sending boxes through UPS, which has opened up so many doors for me. I send all over the UK, to London, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Iaposm doing about six to ten boxes a week currently, so itaposs great. “I had hoped it would be something I could do down the line, but not for another few years, but things have really pushed on since lockdown. “I know it’s been hard for some people, but I don’t know what I’d have done otherwise. I’ve thrived.” aposI needed to press pause on normal leapos Sophie James, , lives in Cardf Bay and has been unemployed since lockdown. At the time, she had been working in retail and had began suffering ill health just before restrictions came into effect. As much as itaposs awful how people have been affected and not something I would have wished to happen, personally itaposs been quite good timing for me. I was getting quite ill and needed to take time out from working anyway. Itaposs sort of strange that the world came to a stop almost at the same time I did. I got a bit overworked and suffering from some problems with mental health. I felt I needed a break and then it happened for the whole world. It had gotten to the point where I didnapost know whether I was quitting or not anyway, but when I got ill and lockdown happened I gave in my notice, as I realised I needed this time to get my health sorted and press pause on normal le almost.  Itaposs allowed me to work on my mental health, get back into my hobbies and do things that arenapost just work. I have asthma so Iaposve been staying inside pretty much all the time. Iaposve been doing a lot of sewing, drawing and painting. I studied art at uni so Iaposve been getting back into that, which I havenapost really done since leaving. Sophie said lockdown has even improved her communication with friends and family. Iaposve been talking to lots of people I hadnapost spoken to in a while, friends from uni that I moved away from and naturally stopped talking to as much. My family live in dferent parts of England and we FaceTimed every now and then [before lockdown], but since lockdown weaposve been doing group quizzes two or three times a week with my grandmother who lives alone, which has been really nice.

She recalled: “The car was going fast and I moved out of the way.” She continued: “I saw him drive to the clf where he sped up and drove over the clf. I was shocked.  I saw he had driven over the clf through a wire fence and gorse bushes. I couldnapost see below as it was a steep clf.” She told how she immediately rang , and added: “He looked determined and I would say it was a deliberate act.” The inquest heard that Mr David, who was born in Yeovil and lived in Derby, had previously lived in Seaton with his second we Linda. She told in a statement how they first met in , and then moved to Derby in  to be nearer her family. By then, Mr David had long been medically retired from Western Helicopters in Yelverton due to earlier exposure to depleted uranium while working for the MoD, and a quest for compensation saw his case, which he subsequently lost, heard by the High Court in London. Mrs David recalled: He would suffer from shortness of breath, gout and joint pains, and his kidneys did notthat well.” She added he also was prescribed medication for depression which he managed ‘well’, and had been given a le expectancy to  years old due to his exposure to depleted uranium. She said: “This did not cause him any issues and when he was  he was probably at his best. He really did love le and had plans to decorate and he was looking forward to Christmas.” The month before his death she told how he had been troubled by a letter he had written to their local newspaper about someone who was going to lay a wreath for Remembrance Day, which he later retracted and was never published. She added it affected his appetite and said he had not been taking his anti-depressants since the end of September, but believed he had started taking them again. She also told how he was suffering from pain in his neck which he thought could be throat cancer. Then on November , she said he told her he was gay, and how she had gone to her daughter’s that night. Mrs David said: “He said he was not brave enough to kill himself. I told him I did not want this, but needed some space, and suggested he went and stayed with his brother John in Yeovil.” They last spoke on the phone the day before his death when Mrs David said she told him she still needed a bit more time. Devastated by his death, she said: “It has left me shocked and I still can’t quite believe this has happened. This is out of character. “For as long as I have known him he did suffer from depression. He never in the past said he wanted to take his le, nor did he ever attempt to do it.” Mr David’s son-in-law Ben Ward, who stayed with him overnight after he disclosed he was gay, told in a statement that his personality at the time was unrecognisable. He said: “He never said anything about hurting himself, and when I left I said we were all there for him, and not to do anything stupid. He replied he would not do anything.” Paying tribute to him, his stepdaughter Emma Ward said: “He adored his family, and was genuinely one of the kindest, nicest people I have had the privilege of meeting.” She added: “He wanted to change the world, and although he could be naive he had the biggest heart of anyone you could ever meet. He is missed terribly and had plenty to live for. “There is no doubt in my mind from his texts and what my mum told me that something broke in his mind.” The last person Mr David spoke to was his brother John who recalled in a statement how his brother had confided in him about what his le had been like.  He said: “He stated he had felt dferent all of his le. I did ask himthis was sexually or his mind, and he replied both.” The day before he died, John recalled Mr David having spoken to the Samaritans, and booked a doctor’s appointment, and appeared to be in ‘a better place’. However, by the evening his mood had dropped again, and the last he saw of him was when he woke up at am and saw Mr David driving off in his car without his belongings. The cause of his death was confirmed as fatal trauma. His GP reported in a statement how Mr David had suffered depression and anxiety dating back to , and had expressed some suicidal thoughts triggered by his court case in the High Court.

Here, she explains why itaposs so important. Why in Britain, in , are black people still marching against racism and injustice  In a hard-hitting series, launching today on Windrush Day – the nd anniversary of the Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury – we’ll look at issues affecting black British lives and why they matter. We start with health. I was honoured to play a role in commissioning a brilliant group of writers who are telling stories long overdue. I hope you read them in the spirit they are written in – a desire to deepen understanding of the issues and create a fairer society, where people are no longer judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. Mirror writer Adenike Adenitire takes a closer look at four of the most devastating health issues affecting Britainaposs black community. Here is what sheaposs found. Blood cancer  Orin Lewis OBE and we Beverley De-Gale OBE run the charity African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust. For  years it has worked to help patients with blood cancer and other illnesses to find stem cell, blood or organ donors, as there is an extreme shortage in the black community. ACLT was founded in  after the couple’s then six-year-old son Daniel De-Gale became the first black person in the UK to receive a stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor. Daniel unfortunately passed away in  at the age of  as a result of multiple organ failure. Orin says: “There is a pandemic virus called racism that is affecting all sectors of society, including health. The Royal College of Nursing came out last week to admit they’ve got a big problem with how black and other nurses from ethnic minorities are treated. “And we see it because our struggle to fund our work to save lives shouldn’t be this hard after nearly  years.” For details visit aclt.org. Sickle cell Sickle Cell Disease is Britain’s biggest genetic blood disease, affecting , people in the country – mainly those of African and Caribbean heritage. Episodes of excruciating pain may occur, which are treated with strong painkillers such as morphine. Those suffering from the condition are at risk of complications such as a stroke, blindness and bone damage. The disease can also result in deathnot treated properly. Approximately  babies are born with SCD in the UK every year but problems of lack of awareness and funding remain. John James OBE, CEO of Britain’s leading sickle cell charity The Sickle Cell Society, says: “Sickle Cell is something that has been known about for over  years but there has been very limited innovation research and development into modying treatment. Why is that  “Some people would ask: ‘If this was the biggest blood condition in the UK but it was affecting predominantly white people, would it still be the same ’” Dame Elizabeth Anionwu, who won a Letime Achievement Award at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards for transforming care for people with sickle cell disease, agrees that patients can face undue prejudice. She says: “There is still an issue about pain relief. “There are still some iniduals of African or Caribbean heritage, who are patients, but are thought of as drug addicts because they need drugs like morphine.” More information is avilable at sicklecellsociety.org. Mental health As a black person in the UK, you are four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act than a white person, according to data collected from NHS Digital. Figures have shown black men are  times more likely to have serious mental health issues such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, yet only % of psychologists are from BAME backgrounds. An independent report conducted by the Centre for Mental Health noted that experiences of racism “appear to be a major influence on the mental health of black boys and young men that wear down their resilience during teenage and young adult years”. The study, which spoke to just under  participants, “found evidence of the incrementally damaging impact of a stream of negative media representations and demonising portrayals of black culture that led men to ‘mask’ their true selves”. Eche Egbuonu’s first experience with mental health issues was during his final year of university. The college lecturer, , from Hackney, East London, said: “There was an identity crisis I went through, where I was surrounded by lots of people but I still felt at my loneliest.” In , he suffered a psychotic episode of mania after having a dispute with his family. The police were called to the home and he was taken to a cell while a bed was prepared for him at a hospital. He says: “Some of the ways they got me into the cell seemed very heavy-handed given the fact that I had not been violent towards the officers or any other inidual. “So I could not understand that level of force or the need to place me in a prison cell.” Child birth  Black women in the UK are five times more likely than white women to die during childbirth according to a  report from Mothers and Babies Reducing Risk Through Audits and Confidential Enquiries. Candice Brathwaite, blogger and author of best-selling book I Am Not Your Baby Mother, understands this only too well after her own experience seven years ago of giving birth to her first child, daughter Esmé-Olivia. The  year-old says: “From beginning to end it was a mess. I was induced and left to wait hours for pain medicine while I was surrounded by labouring white women who seemed to be covered in this maternal care. It really felt like I was an annoyance.” After giving birth, Candice started feeling very unwell and told midwives. She says: “Their attitude was very much ‘you are overthinking it’ and ‘you are just having baby blues’.” But just two days after going home, baby Esmé fell asleep on Candice’s chest and the weight of her tiny body was enough to burst a septic sac growing underneath Candice’s C- section wound.

Three people were killed when a man armed with a kne started stabbing people aposrandomlyapos at Forbury Park in the city. The incident was initially reported as being treated as a potential terror attack by security services, but police have since said it is not being treated as a terrorism incident, with a -year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder. A source told the Sunday Mirror: “A man pulled a kne and started attacking people at random in Reading, near the Crown Court. “It is thought there was one attacker who has surrendered to police.  It appears the attack was stopped when a lone sergeant, who responded when the alarm was raised, ran to the scene, saw the attacker running away with a kne and rugby tackled him to the ground.” Personal trainer Lawrence Wort, , who said he was around  metres from the attack, told PA: The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends, when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went around a large group of around , trying to stab them. He stabbed three of them, severely in the neck, and under the arms, and then turned and started running towards me, and we turned and started running.When he realised that he couldnapost catch us, he tried to stab another group sat down, he got one person in the back of the neck and then when he realised everyone was starting to run, he ran out the park. Another witness, Dan, , said he saw a man running around a circle of people apostappingapos them and at first thought they were playing a game - before he saw blood. Dan, a local, described how he and his friends had chosen a spot to sit and enjoy the sunshine at the park in Reading, Berkshire when he noticed the commotion. He said he saw a man approach a group sitting in the sun about  metres away.They were just in a circle chatting. Dan saw the man drew his attention because he appeared to be racing around the group tapping them on the head. He pointed them out to his friends. He told the : I thought they were playing duck duck goose and thought someone had been sick, we realised it was blood spraying out.  To their horror Dan and his friends suddenly realised the group were being attacked. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: My thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading and my thanks to the emergency services on the scene. Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted that she was deeply concerned and it is understood she is being kept updated on the situation. A Thames Valley Police statement said:A number of people sustained injuries and were taken to hospital.

It is understood that scientists have given their approval to reduce the distance people need to stay apart to one metre, provided other precautions are taken. MPs and tourism bosses have been calling for clarity over when bookings can be accepted again, and how the hospitality sector will operate post-lockdown. Former Environment Minister Owen Paterson told the Mail: To have any hope of saving this summer season for our tourist industry, the Government must announce this week what the arrangements will be for reopening on July . Ministers canapost leave our holiday parks, hotels and pubs in the dark any longer.  Meanwhile Patricia Yates, the chief executive of Visit Britain, said: We need to know what the plan is. The lack of Government guidelines and that uncertainty around the date is causing a great deal of consternation within the industry.

The haunting images show tables scattered with moulds of human jaws and sets of  teeth implants left strewn across the floor.The building opened as st Dental on Wetherby Road, Harrogate, in , specialising in dental moulds for dental prosthetics but also served as a private general dentist, as reported by Yorkshire Live.Before that, the site was occupied by Aesthetic Dental services. After st Dental was placed into administration in , it was bought out by investment firm Zeus Group, but the branch closed its doors in .Eight years later it remains unused and often attracts youngsters in the town who use it as a place to socialise.

Located within the town I live, Iaposve had this old dentist pinned since the beginning, and finally found out it had access.

Assangeaposs secret fiancée Stella Moris has laid bare her relationship with Mr Assange after the bombshell revelation they had two children during his seven-year stint in the embassy. In an upcoming interview, the South-African born lawyer will reveal she fell in love with the high profile Australian WikiLeaks founder. Mr Assange caught authorities and his followers unawares when it emerged he had fallen in love and managed to start a secret family despite his bunkered le.  The couple conceived two children during embassy visits while she was trying to halt his extraditions to Sweden and the US. Itaposs quite something that one of the most surveyed people on the planet managed to carve out a space for a family and a partner, Mr Assangeaposs fiancée, Ms Moris is set to tell  Minutes reporter Tara Brown in a world exclusive interview. It wasnapost easy, but I thinkyouaposre with someone you love, you can make impossible situations possible. In , a starstruck Ms Moris joined team Assange as a legal researcher. When I first met him, I felt so fortunate that I was able to meet this person who had changed the world really with Wikileaks, Ms Moris says.  It was very romantic and cautious and very sweet. Although the Embassy was an unlikely love nest, by  Mr Assange and Ms Moris were deeply in love.By , the pair were secretly engaged. While she admits that the circumstances were less than ideal to raise a family, she says their love for one another eclipsed their concerns. We loved each other, and we wanted to start a family. All these other circumstances would change but that was a certainty, she says.  I got pregnant and we were over the moon. The couple consider their love affair, along with their children, three-year-old Gabriel and -month-old Max, acts of rebellion. Ms Moris, cautious of prying eyes and ears, even had to write down her big news on a piece of paper in fear of being secretly recorded at the Embassy. When I got pregnant the first time, there were microphones everywhere. I had to write it down on a piece of paper to tell him, she reveals in the interview. Mr Moris never lived in the Embassy and so giving birth and raising the coupleaposs children was very much a solitary affair. But she still pursued a family le with Mr Assange, taking the children to see him whenever possible. In her interview with  Minutes, his partner explains the strict security measures she had to take. You donapost take these steps lightly. You only do thisyou think that thereaposs a very serious security risk. She explained that she hid both her pregnancies from everyone at the Embassy. I thought that our family would be targeted by the same people that were trying to harm Julian in a bid to harm him. Creating an elaborate cover to ensure security and safety, the couple recruited close friend, British actor Stephen Hoo, to pose as their childaposs father in order to sht attention from a compromised Mr Assange. Stephen played the part of doting dad, while Ms Moris would arrive and leave the Embassy separately to hide that she was the babyaposs mother. But security staff at the Embassy were dubious. They collected a dossier on Mr Hoo and also concocted what Ms Morris alleges was a plan to target her eldest child Gabriel and steal his DNA by collecting his nappy and dummy. They had instructions to steal his DNA in order to establish that Julian was the father, and in a bid to hurt Julian, Ms Moris claims in the interview. Itaposs also alleged that recordings of Mr Assangeaposs privileged conversations with his lawyers and doctors were being sent back to America to bolster their pending extradition case against him. Worse, according to the security firm whistle blowers, there was canvassing of plots to forcibly remove Mr Assange from the Embassy and have him killed. I think itaposs hard for people to understand that such lawlessness is possible, Ms Moris says. Thereaposs incredible criminality that has been going on in order to gather information about Julianaposs lawyers, and his family, and journalists who were visiting him. Iaposve been in a permanent state of fear for years and now itaposs slowly playing out. Last April, Julian Assangeaposs political asylum was revoked, and in an unprecedented move, police in London were invited in to arrest him. Few would have known that along with his eviction and arrest, Mr Assange was leaving behind two young children and a long-term partner. Assange took up residence in the Ecuadorian embassy in  to avoid being extradited to Sweden. A rape charge brought by the country’s prosecutors has since been dropped but he is also wanted in America for allegedly leaking classied intelligence documents.

Iaposm really pleased that I got to give birth at home as I would have had to go alone to the hospitalnot with my husband staying at home with the girls. I had planned to have a home birth from the start and was concerned when NHS trusts started to close down the home birth service as I was so dead set on it. I researched unassisted birthing and then ended up hiring two independent midwives so that I could definitely have the birth that I wanted and felt this was the safest. The midwives were very supportive and werenapost concerned about his size - they both felt that your body would not produce a baby that you canapost give birth to and were very encouraging of my plans, although none of us thought heaposd turn out quite so big.aposapos  Baby Aria was born in hospital after a long delivery that required forcep assistance and resulted in a big tear and an episiotomy.

But she says, whilst money remains incredibly tight, sheaposs actually managed to find a disciplined way to make her finances work for her small family.Vicky told Birmingham Live she is delighted by the news that she will now receive free school meal vouchers over the summer holidays, thanks to a government u-turn following football star Marcus Rashfordaposs campaign.She is sharing how she will use this money to feed them both over the six week break. I donapost class myself as a poor person even though we live below the poverty line, said Vicky, from Mosely, who is a full-time mum to Daniel, five. Itaposs all to do with budgeting and planning exactly what we need. As soon as we get our universal credit payment, I do a big monthly shop but I only buy the things we need. I never buy three-for-two offers and things like that and I donapost buy packets of fruit. Say we have two bananas at home, Iaposll just buy five loose bananas rather than a bag of seven because we donapost need them. We then do a small top-up weekly shop of fresh fruit and vegetables.  I also portion our meals carefully and I donapost allow my son to snack freely throughout the day. He has one snack in the morning and one in the afternoon, like at school, so we know exactly how much we need when we go shopping. Thataposs the dference, itaposs about not buying things you donapost really need but only buying the things you do need, when you need them. The government made a £ million government u-turn on free school meal vouchers after the Prime Minister bowed to pressure from campaigners include England striker Rashford.Rashford had posted a poignant open letter sharing how his family relied on free school meals, piling on pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to make the free schools meals announcement.It now means that every pupil entitled to free school meals in Birmingham will be given food vouchers for six weeks to cover the summer holidays. For Vicky, this means she will receive £ a month to spend on lunches for her son. But with her clever budgeting skills, she believes she can make this money stretch even further. I have to get an Uber to go shopping so itaposs better for me to just do it once a month, said Vicky, who worked as a cleaner before she had Daniel. She hopes toto work again soon.

A total of  people have now been diagnosed at the Two Sisters chicken factory in Llangefni, Anglesey.Public Health Wales said that  more people linked to the meat plant had tested positive as of pm on Sunday - in addition to the  who had tested positive as of pm on Saturday. Dr Christopher Johnson, Consultant in Health Protection at Public Health Wales said: “Since we commenced targeted testing last Thursday, over  members of staff have provided samples so far. Testing of employees continues, and it is likely that some additional cases will be identied in coming days.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here“The increase in cases is as we anticipated when a focused track and trace programme is implemented, and does not mean that the spread of infection is increasing.First Minister Mark Drakeford had initially said that he thought local lockdowns were unlikely to be used in Wales, reports WalesOnline.But in recent weeks both he and Health Minister Vaughan Gething have indicated they are likely to be part of the Welsh Governmentaposs plans. And now it appears that they are being considered in north Wales right now just as the First Minister announced a loosening of restrictions across the nation from Monday with shops reopening.Economy Minister Ken Skates told ITV  that weaposve not ruled that out a local lockdown on Anglesey because it would be more desirable than pushing the entire country back into a full lockdown.He added: In order to deal with these localised spikes itaposs essential that all public bodies and employers work together immediately to test, to track, and to protect people from further fallout from the virus.  We have in Wales a very successful test, track and protect system that has been rolled out at a local authority level. That enabled us to intervene instantly such as that which weaposve seen on Anglesey. There have been coronavirus outbreaks linked to meat plants reported across the UK and Europe. In Germany, , infections have been linked to a slaughterhouse in the north-western region of Bielefeld. In Wales, there have been outbreaks at Rowan Foods in Wrexham and  Sisters in Llangefni. And there has been an outbreak at a Yorkshire plant that supplies bacon to Asda where  staff have been infected. New figures released on Sunday by Public Health Wales show that there have been  new cases of Covid- reported to it in Wales in the last  hours. These will not include most of the new cases related to the Llangefni plant, which are likely to be recorded in Mondayaposs figure.

There were also  people who address is currently unknown. Away from north Wales, there were no cases reported in Swansea, Bridgend, Newport, Caerphilly, Torfaen, the Vale of Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire and Merthyr Tydfil. In its statement on Sunday, Dr Johnson of Public Health Wales said: “I would like to thank the workforce and wider community for their swt co-operation with this test and trace process. This rapid response is providing vital information to help minimise the further spread of COVID- locally. “We must remember that COVID- has not gone away. Incidents like this show the potential for pockets of asymptomatic undiagnosed infection in the community, highlighting the importance of the adherence to social distancing and hygiene measures. “The deployment of rapid test and trace facilities has helped identy this situation and we will continue to keep control measures in place to bring the outbreak to a rapid conclusion. “It therefore remains essential that all members of the public, including employees of  Sisters Food Group and their close contacts, continue to recognise the vital role they have in preventing the spread of Coronavirus, to help keep Wales safe.

He is one of  London Ambulance Service staff to have moved into temporary accommodation since the start of lockdown so they could stay on the frontline while protecting loved ones. The couple and their children Phoebe, six, and George, two, are postponing Father’s Day until they can all be together again. Andrew, , said: It has been dficult being away from the kids and I really miss them - but I know it’s a small price to pay to protect them and Shelley. George is too young to understand, but Phoebe is a little bit older and gets why I have to stay away and the important work all parents in the NHS are doing to keep everyone safe. Between shts Andrew - who works on fast-response vehicles treating le-threatening cases - stays at a hotel in Greenwich, south-east London, six miles from his family home in Thamesmead. He is on a five-week rota that allows him to work three weeks and self-isolate in his hotel room on the fourth - so he can be reunited with his young children on the fth. Paramedic of  years Andrew said: The novelty of having peace and quiet after -hour shts quickly wore off! I miss the children pestering me - though Phoebe will FaceTime me three times a day and I’ll go round to wave at the kids from outside the flat twice a week. It has been a worry as Shelley was not well and in hospital before lockdown and she is in the middle of a flare-up at the moment - possibly linked to stress. As she can’t leave the house I sometimes pick up food shopping and help take the bins out. She leaves them outside the main flat entrance so I can pick up and take them down. Having that one week out of five together just makes it bearable, though George has started to realise what it means when I put my green unorm on again and cries when I leave – knowing it will be a month before I see him again. The dad has been busy during lockdown, working overtime to support his family and adapting to safety measures when treating patients.  He said: Every patient is approached as a suspected Covid- case until proven otherwise. The biggest challenge has been getting to grips with working in PPE as it’s a personal job with lots of contact. Being a dad, when I deal with kids I normally have a good rapport with them, but that’s hard to do behind a mask.

For missing from today’s fun is little Noah, who would have turned three this weekend. The adopted toddler died last November after a stomach infection led to complications. Ben was devastated. But with four other adopted children to focus on – each one with their own needs – he was determined to ensure happy memories of the boy they had lost. The children made a memory tree in disabled Noah’s honour – covered in rainbows and crystals. And there are photos of him in every room. Ben says: “The children sang a lullaby to Noah at his funeral. “My eldest always says good morning to him. And my daughter takes his teddy with her wherever she goes.” Ben also bought a card to mark what should have been Noah’s birthday. He adds: “It’s made me realise, you’ve got to make the most of every moment. And that’s what Noah did. “He may have been a little boy in a wheelchair but he had so much le about him. He taught people a lot.”  Single Ben is also dad to Jack, , Ruby, nine, Lilly, seven, and Joseph, four. And a new member of the family has arrived – a -month-old boy. Ben hopes to complete the adoption process soon. He goes on: “At one stage I thought there’s no way I can go through with this and adopt again. And there was an element of ‘am I trying to replace Noah ’ “But then I realised this little boy needs me, just as much as Noah needed me and the other children needed me. And the fact of the matter is, I could never replace him. “We’re hoping to have a picnic for Father’s Day. It’s going to be sad but I’m going to have pictures of Noah in the garden too, so he can be there with us. “I’m still Noah’s father, whether he’s here or not. I’m a father of six, but now I’m only caring for five.” Ben, from West Yorkshire, was  when he first applied to adopt. A couple of years later he welcomed Jack, who has autism and linked obsessive compulsive disorder. But under Ben’s care he has thrived.  Ben then went on to adopt blind Ruby, whose other conditions include spine curvature and limited use of her arms. He is also dad to Ruby’s half-sister Lilly, who is deaf, as well as Joseph, who has Down Syndrome. And the latest member of the family has “quite severe complex needs”, says Ben. Reflecting on Noah, he recalls the awful day the lad slipped away after falling ill. Noah had the rare condition Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. Sufferers have masses of hair. Noah also suffered deformities in his arms and had to be tube fed. Ben says: “I took him to the hospital the day before he died and they sent him home and said he had a viral infection. “The next day we got up, I put him in his chair and went to fetch his medication. When I came back he’d passed away. I tried to resuscitate him but there was nothing I could do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tragic alexs story saved 12","story":"NewsPic of tragic Alex  hours before he died saves  kids from rare Covid- conditionEXCLUSIVE: Baby Alexander Parsons was killed by the rare condition PIMS-TS, but his story has saved other childrens livesShareCommentsByGrace Macaskillkelly jenkins:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsAlexander Parsons from Plymouth who was just eight-months-old when he died \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Kerry Postlethwaite was among parents shocked by our story about baby Alexander Parsons, who was killed by the rare condition PIMS-TS. Two days later her own son Joseph, eight, fell ill with matching symptoms . Mum-of-three Kerry, , of Anstey, Leics, said: “Joseph had Covid-like symptoms in March but they disappeared. A couple of days after reading about Alex, he developed the same cough and temperature out of the blue and said he also had a tummy ache. “I called  and they suggested we get him a test for Covid, but I couldn’t get Alex’s story out of my head. “Next day Joseph developed a sun-burn rash. He’d been in the paddling pool but was slathered in sunscreen. “That was the one thing that stood out for me. It was like a clock ticking. “I called  again and luckily they knew about the symptoms.” Joseph was taken to Leicester Infirmary where tests revealed one of his heart arteries was inflamed. Kerry added: “It was awful. Joseph said the pain in his heart made him crazy because it was hurting and asked mehe was going to die.  You are trying to fight back tears but you are mummy and you have to kiss it better evenyou don’t know things are going to be okay.” Joseph was given immunoglobulin – which helps destroy viruses – and released from hospital six days later. Kerry added: “I’ll be forever grateful to the family for finding the courage to share Alex’s story. It saved Joseph.” Alex was just eight months old. His mum Kathryn, , from Plymouth, said: “Losing Alex is awful but the fact our beautul boy could have saved other children’s lives is the one positive that can be taken from his death.  We’re so proud of him. “The fact people looked at Alex’s little face and took in the information that potentially saved their children is the best legacy we could ask for. A dozen or more families have been in touch with us to say they recognised their child had symptoms after reading about Alex. I’m so proud Alex has helped do this. He was amazing and had an impact on every single person he met.”  We can reveal  British children have ended up in intensive care with PIMS-TS since March. Just like Kawasaki disease, it inflames blood vessels as the body’s immune system goes into overdrive to fight Covid- infection.  The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Professor Russell Viner, was so concerned by the emergence of the condition that he wrote to NHS England on the day Alex died. That alert helped doctors diagnose Leia Godwin, who spent four weeks in hospital after being hit by the disease.Six-month-old Leia, of Risca, South Wales, had a high temperature and rash while her identical twin Thea had no symptoms at all. Antibody tests showed Leia had coronavirus in the past.The twins could now hold the key to why Covid- affects some people more badly than others. Doctors at the Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital in Cardf have taken blood samples for genetic testing. Mum Hannah Godwin, , said: “Leia had a rash on her feet and I think the doctors initially thought it was septicaemia or meningitis. But then the alert about Alex was issued.“I believe his doctors were in touch with ours and we know we are lucky to have Leia home. It was such a scary time and she was so poorly. “Doctors don’t yet know why Leia got ill and Thea didn’t. We’ve given them permission to do whatever research they need to help other people.” As many as  British children have developed the condition. London’s Imperial College examined  and found a range of symptoms from a high temperature and abdominal pain to conjunctivitis and coronary inflammation. All the youngsters had a fever. Just over half had a rash.  Elizabeth Whittaker, a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial, said: “We know there have been fewer than  but more than  UK cases. “This isn’t going away. At the beginning there was a huge influx of cases. That settled down, but I think we will see a few new cases every week.” Her colleague Professor Michael Levin said more blood tests must be carried out on children suspected to have the condition. Alex is believed to be the first British child killed by PIMS-TS. His family is campaigning for greater awareness – backed by the parents of a five-year-old who nearly died.

The temperatures look set to be highest around Englandaposs south and south-east, the Midlands, inland parts of the north, and south Wales for a balmy Wednesday afternoon. The Met Officeaposs new forecast out today heralded temperatures as high as C on Wednesday. The week ahead is set to bring a dry spell to much of the UK for some relief for locked-down Brits. However there are thunderstorm warnings potentially in store for Thursday, forecasters say. The BBC says the mercury could hit C in London on Friday, with five successive days of C or higher on the cards. Temperatures in Manchester will also hit C from Wednesday onwards.  Britain is almost certain to beat its hottest day of the year, which is .C on May  at Dawyck, Scottish Borders. And although Brits can travel to Spain as of today as the country eases its restrictions for tourists - weather at home in the UK should be warmer than the C or C forecast in Gran Canaria or the C on Tenere this week.It had been shaping up to be a damp end to June for people relying on fine weather for socially-distant meetings with friends and family in parks and gardens under the current rules.The outlook for the rest of the week should see the mercury hit the twenties and thirties, according to the Met Office. Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Martin Young, said on Friday: “By the middle of next week we’ll see temperatures across much of England and Wales widely climbing into the mid to high twenties Celsius and it will probably be hot in parts of southern and eastern England, as temperatures peak close to C. “It’s possible Northern Ireland and Scotland will join the rest of the country in seeing a spell of warmer weather later next week, as this hot air from the continent extends northwards across the UK.  Mr Young added: “We’re keeping a close eye on the possibility of severe thunderstorms developing later next week too, triggered by the warm continental air.” UK weather this week Monday According to the Met Office, it will be cloudy and windy in the northwest with some rain at times. The weather should be dry where, and sunniest across central, southern and eastern England where it will feel warm. Tuesday to Thursday The northwest gloom continues, with cloud and outbreaks of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.

But in his role of chief executive officer at Centrepoint, Seyi Obakin OBE has spent a lot of time with Prince William, teaching him about the homeless charityaposs work and mission. The Duke of Cambridge is so committed to learning about the issue among young people that he spent a night sleeping on the streets with Seyi back in . He first visited one of their centres when he was child as his mum Princess Diana wanted him and Prince Harry to understand the issue, and has been passionate about their work ever since. He became patron in  - his first royal patronage when he was just , the same age many users are when they first receive support from the charity - and has spent the past  years learning, raising awareness and helping their cause in any way he way. Speaking to the Mirror, Seyi said: He was introduced to this problem early in his le. We were over the moon and delighted [when he wanted to be our patron]. The Princess of Wales, Diana, was our patron for many years, and then we had several years after she passed on when we didnapost have a patron at all. It was a great feeling for us that William wanted to carry on. I think it says something about an incredible testament to his motheraposs legacy that he wanted to be patron of Centrepoint and remain involved in finding a way through homelessness. He has a voice that most of us will never have, I think it is to his immense credit that heaposs happy to use that for the benefit of homeless people. I for one am grateful that he doe that. Speaking about the charity in  to mark its th anniversary, William recalled his visit with Diana as a child. He said: That example of selfless service that Centrepoint represents has stayed with me, and that is why it was the first charity that I wanted to be associated with. The extraordinary courage of so many of Centrepoint’s young people in rising to meet such seemingly insurmountable challenges in their lives. In order to do this, William carries out both private and public visits.  Public visits - the ones you read about in newspapers and see photos from on social media - are designed to raise awareness of the cause. However the private visits, which are done behind closed doors, are very dferent. Seyi said: We are working with some of the most vulnerable young people in the country. At public visits there are flashing lights and cameras, itaposs not the best time for young people to open up and thataposs what private visits can do. Those private visits are time when traumatised and vulnerable people are freer in his presence.  There are no cameras there, there are no journalists there. Theyaposre not worrying about whether what theyaposre saying might end up in the newspapers. He comes and he chats with young people, because thataposs when heaposs able to motivate and inspire on a one-to-one basis. He encourages young people to reach out to wherever their talents might take them. Prince William has an incredible gt, a talent, to put people at ease. I have seen young people chatting to him like old friends within minutes, I donapost think many people can do that.  The most powerful thing when he visits is that he can be so informal and easy to get on with. If you are a young person, often what happens is you donapost even know heaposs coming. You hear that Prince William is here. The first thing that happens, is you can get quite nervous - youaposll lost for words. But his own informality helps young people to break that down. He can have great conversations with young people that are really helpful to them. Itaposs an incredible thing, that heaposs able to do that.  Seyi shared one story that sticks in his mind about Williamaposs ability to make people feel at ease. I was at an event with him several years ago and he met this young person. She knew he was coming and she had completely clammed up and couldnapost get her words out. The prince bends down and whispered into the ears of this young person and it was like a flood gate. She started talking and couldnapost stop. Thataposs what itaposs like. In his role, William spends time learning about the issue of homelessness by meeting people who have been affected and those helping them. He is also an advocate for the issue, and Seyi says he also challenges us to do better, helping the charity to grow.  As part of his quest to understand more about homelessness, William spent a night sleeping on the streets with Seyi in . They decided to do it in December, which meant temperatures dropped as low as minus C. Speaking at the time, William said: I was very struck by the people I met and what they were struggling with – sleeping rough, sofa surfing, not having basic comforts a lot of us take for granted. That really struck me at a young age, bearing in mind the gulf for me, growing up in a palace, and seeing the other end of the spectrum where others were faced with huge personal challenges and were overcoming them. That was powerful to see at a young age. Seyi says William is also extremely passionate about their cause and wants to help in any way he can, and that he also remembers people he has spoken to them and checks in on their progress months later.  He said: He must meet thousands of people every year, and yet he has this incredible capacity to remember those heaposs met and ask after them several months later. Imagine youaposre a young person, and you find yourself cooking, eating and chatting with Prince William in private. Imagine what that does to motivate you. Knowing also, that in three months time, he might be asking how youaposre getting on. Itaposs hugely powerful and inspiring. Weaposve lucky to have him in our corner. Seyi says that William is also very approachable and jokes about with the users. He recalls a time when a young person stared at him, trying to work out why he recognised him.  They told him: You look like somebody famous. You look like Prince William, to which the Duke replied: Yeah, yeah, a lot of people have said that before and just carried on with his work. Like all charities, Centerpoint has had to adapt to the coronavirus lockdown, working in extremely dficult circumstances to ensure they can still help people. Theyaposve struggled with both fundraising and the logistics of services, trying to work out how to do what they do with social distancing and PPE.

Emily Egan, , went mute in January this year and doctors were left confused after countless tests failed to explain why or flag up a known condition. By the end of March, Emily finally began to speak again, but her voice sounded nothing like the Essex accent she had before. Emily now mostly speaks with a Polish accent - even in aposbroken Englishapos at times - but her voice can suddenly change to sound French and Italian as well. If she experiences a lot of stress, her accent becomes Russian, and when she is exhausted, Emily can lose the ability to speak altogether. This whole experience has been exhausting and totally overwhelming, Emily said. Itaposs not just my accent that has changed - I donapost speak or think in the same way as before this and I canapost construct sentences like I used to. I write dferently now, my whole vocabulary has changed and my English has gotten worse despite living in the UK all of my le. My dad has said that I donapost sound like me any more in that heaposd never imagine me wording things like I do now.Iaposve even experienced abuse from strangers who think I am foreign - I had a man shout at me in the supermarket saying foreigners like me are the reason we have coronavirus.Itaposs changed my le completely. After months of confusion, Emily has finally been diagnosed with foreign accent syndrome - a rare speech disorder caused by brain damage. Medics initially suspected a stroke, but it was ruled out and they believe her speech disorder was caused by brain damage - but donapost yet know what caused itIt all began after Emily began suffering from headaches for two weeks before her voice suddenly deepened while she was working at the childrenaposs home she manages in Bournemouth in January earlier this year. Her speech rapidly became slow and slurred - a key indication of a stroke - so Emily was rushed to hospital where she underwent extensive CT and MRI scans. Doctors ruled out a stroke but were left confused when Emily lost the ability to speak completely during her hospital stay. She was discharged to a neurologist after three weeks in hospital but still without a voice, and communicated solely through an app on her phone. She said: I knew a bit of basic sign language as I needed it for work years ago but I just used my hands to express what I wanted to say. I had to use a apostext to speakapos app on my iPhone which sounded like Stephen Hawkins and it just wasnapost me. Adjusting to communicating like this was so hard, I felt like a completely dferent person.  Emily and her partner Bradleigh, , had booked a holiday to Thailand before she fell ill and her neurologist encouraged her to take the trip and try to relax as much as possible. Five days into her holiday in March, Emily slowly began to speak again but with great dficulty and she said she sounded deaf. Her voice slowly grew stronger as the days passed but Emily was shocked when she realised she had developed an Eastern European accent. She was diagnosed with foreign accent syndrome after ing from Thailand and now her voice rapidly changes between Polish, Russian, French and Italian.  Emily said: Iaposm an Essex girl normally - my accent was really strong and my voice was very high pitched and really recognisable, people always knew it was me calling. On holiday, I started making sounds like a deaf person trying to talk - it is thought that the neuropathways had started to open as my body had completely relaxed. By the time I was home, the words were sounding like a foreign language. I was so thrilled when my voice started coming back but now I donapost even recognise the voice that comes out of my mouth, it doesnapost sound like me. I actually used to be so good at putting on accents for my friends before this and Iaposve even had people askIaposm putting it on - asI could keep it up this long!  Since her diagnosis, Emily has been having private vocal therapy once a week over Zoom but there is no indicationshe will ever regain her normal accent. Her extremely rare condition has sent her body into shut down, leaving her exhausted and she experienced left side weakness two weeks ago. Again a symptom of a stroke, Emily was rushed to hospital and has now been diagnosed with a al neurological disorder as well. Her left arm and hand are now paralysed but doctors hope she will regain feeling and movement with time and physical therapy. Emily said: Iaposm only  years old and I am shocked at how much my le has changed in a matter of months. Iaposve had to stop working because my job is quite stressful and the doctors have said stress will only make my condition worse. The hardest thing for me is learning that this voice is ok. I have to learn to accept that itaposs ok for me to not be able to get the words out straight away, itaposll come eventually.

He said: “He was a pervert and more than capable of snatching a child for sexual kicks or money.” We can reveal that Austrian drter Mr Tatschl was grilled last year by German and Austrian police investigating Madeleine’s disappearance.He reportedly told them how his pal bragged about burgling rich tourists’ holiday apartments.  Mr Tatschl, , claimed that Brueckner, , also boasted about “selling kids” – although there as been no evidence found of this so far – and he fears Madeleine was sold to a sex ring.  He claimed: “He was always bragging about money and making money. He even talked about selling kids, maybe to Morocco. “I think he probably sold Maddie to someone. Maybe a sex ring. I was living with him at the time. He was my best friend. I know he did it.” Mr Tatschl claimed that Brueckner was obsessed with the dark web and suspects he used it to deal in pornography and drugs.He also claimed Brueckner had a secret spot in his home in Praia da Lux where he kept stolen loot. Mr Tatschl’s name emerged last week after Portuguese authorities granted access to Brueckner’s court records.They showed Brueckner was locked up on remand with Mr Tatschl after they were caught stealing diesel from lorries.Mr Tatschl, a dad of one who is now back in his native Austria, said he expects an arrest is “imminent” in Madeleine’s case.In his first ever media interview, he described Brueckner as a “strange character”. He said: “He was definitely a pervert. All his friends thought that about him. He had some sexual issues.I really hope they can finally close this case for the family and find Christian guilty for what he has done. He needs to admit it to the police.”  rueckner befriended Mr Tatschl in late . Mr Tatschl began living with him in early  at his farmhouse in Praia da Luz, Algarve, which Brueckner shared with his German girlfriend. Mr Tatschl said: “I was staying at his house and camping in a van in the garden. We spent a lot of time together and had good fun. He did not take drugs at the time but liked to have a drink.” Mr Tatschl claimed that Brueckner bragged about regularly robbing holiday flats.He alleged: “He was a very good burglar and would easily climb up to first-floor apartments when tourists were out.He would steal money, valuables and passports. He had a hiding place in his house, in the roof. He had the money and passports hidden up there.He added: “Christian was always on the dark web. I don’t know exactly what he did but I suspect it involved drugs and pornography.”Mr Tatschl said he was “sucked in” to Brueckner’s le of crime. In April , the pair were caught by police stealing diesel from two lorries in Portimao, Algarve. They spent over eight months on remand in jail awaiting trial. Mr Tatschl claimed that while they were in jail, Brueckner got a pal to clear his home of the alleged stolen loot.He claimed: “He ordered a friend to get rid of any evidence of burglaries or robberies. But this guy and another friend ended up robbing the house and took all the valuables and money. “They also got a video camera from the house, which was how I found out he was a sick b*****d.On that camera was a video of him raping an old woman. It was of this elderly lady who was chained to a wooden post and she was being beaten and raped.”It is not believed that the woman in the video was the American pensioner Brueckner was later convicted of raping and is currently serving jail time for in Germany.After Brueckner’s release from prison, he stayed in Praia da Luz, living in the VW Westfalia van that police later seized.Mr Tatschl said: “I think that confused the police as they were not sure where he was living exactly when Maddie vanished. But he had his van and was living free.” Mr Tatschl moved to the hippy enclave of Orgiva in Andalusia, Spain, in April , weeks before Madeleine, three, vanished on May .He said Brueckner turned up in “late May or early June” driving a Tfin Allegro winnebago. It was in this vehicle that police found a stash of girls’ swimming costumes in .Brueckner also allegedly bragged he could hide “drugs and children” inside the ft-long van.Mr Tatschl said: “He parked it up in Orgiva and came looking for me.“We all wondered where he’d got the money from  It was a big expensive thing. We assumed it was from a big drug deal or something like that. Now I suspect it was Maddie. “He was only there for a couple of days and went on back to Germany. Mr Tatschl lost touch with Brueckner and ed to his native Austria several years ago to start a family. It was while watching last year’s Netflix series The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann that he became convinced his friend was responsible. He claimed: “When I saw the documentary I knew immediately that he was guilty.The part where the female tourist talked about the creepy guy with acne and blond hair, I just knew it was Christian for sure.”Within weeks of the series airing, German and Austrian police knocked on Mr Tatschl’s door. He was interviewed by detectives over two days in April .

than 13000 to support city food bank","story":"A food bank has bought an electric bike to carry out speedy deliveries after receiving a £, funding boost from Aberdeen Harbour Board.Community Food Initiatives North Eastsay the cargo bike will allow volunteers to deliver fresh food and emergency parcels for those who cannot make their way to the premises for health or mobility reasons.It will ensure the social enterprise can reach those in self-isolation in the Torry, Cove and Kincorth areas to hand out vital supplies throughout the pandemic.Among the usual essential food items being dropped off, there will be growing packs so that families can produce their own vegetables.The bike will also help to reduce the charity#s carbon footprint.The chief executive of Aberdeen Harbour Board, Michelle Handforth, praised the group for carrying out #outstanding work# during a dficult time.She said: “The donation will ensure more families and iniduals can receive vital supplies, in a way which reduces carbon emissions and raises awareness of alternative transport options.”Since lockdown measures were implemented,  the food bank has been handing out hundreds of parcels every day.Deputy chief executive of Cfine, Fiona Rae, said the donation would help them to cope with an increasingly high level of demand.She said: “The demand for emergency food has tripled since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak.#Cfine is delivering over , emergency parcels weekly to people experiencing food insecurity.#The electric cargo bike will be put to good use delivering emergency parcels, food growing packs, and fruit and vegetable boxes across Aberdeen and in the surrounding areas, while reducing Cfine’s carbon footprint.”The food bank has received lots of support from the local community as it battles to prevent people from going hungry.Pupils at Ferryhill School launched an -day campaign this week to collect food and household cleaning items for the organisation.And residents of Norfolk Road in Broomhill have been doing weekly dance routines with the intention of raising money for the social enterprise.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

high end fashion store in aberdeen shopping centre1","story":"At the end of last year, Ryan Steehouder decided to take everything – his income, his career, his le – into his own hands.The s had been a rough decade for the Aberdeen native, with a number of highs and lows, and he wanted to begin the twenties afresh, with an idea that had been at the back of his mind through much of his le.After  years in the oil business, he was going to make a sharp turn and start up his own company – in high-end designer fashion.His new store,  Off in the Galleria, is set to open as soon as lockdown restrictions are eased for shops. vw, px\"  However, the sht wasn’t an easy decision to make, particularly considering the rough hand he had been dealt in the preceding years.Ryan, , started in the oil industry almost straight after leaving Aberdeen Grammar School, when he joined the Wood Group and started working in John Wood House.From there he moved between a few jobs in the energy sector, until the oil slump struck in .“I was one of the first to get laid off in November,” said Ryan.What followed was a year and a half of “survival” before he found work again, mainly in offices. But he struggled to shake the idea that there was something he would rather be doing.“I wasn’t enjoying being in an office anymore,” said Ryan.“I decided to pull the trigger when I got to the end of  and I just thought that I wanted to do something dferent.” vw, px\"  Fashion was something he had grown up around. He had an uncle who would travel from Lossiemouth to London regularly to meet up with friends and shop around the one-off Alexander McQueen jackets on display.Ryan said: “I like the nicer things in le, and I definitely like the quality that comes with it. The pieces that can last.”He began  with the plan and the time, but just as he was preparing to open, his worst nightmare struck.“When the coronavirus hit, I didn’t think the gamble had paid off. I thought I was going to lose everything again. I still had my car payments, my mortgage payments, I put all my money into the business, and I was just ready to open and start making money again, and then it didn’t happen.“I started thinking I was going to end up bankrupt a few weeks into the coronavirus lockdown.”But instead of panicking, he used the extra time to his advantage.“I thought it might be a few weeks until lockdown is over, so I got in touch with quite a few micro-influencers that I know,” he said.The influencers “lit up Instagram” one Thursday with a minimal, mysterious post pointing towards his store to build hype and curiosity.It worked. His page gained , followers in  hours, and it is still growing ahead of the launch of the physical store in the Galleria, on a date that is yet to be determined.“I’ll announce it on Instagram, to let everyone know that it’s open, then obviously we’ll have socially distancing measures in place. Hopefully very soon.”For now, though, he’s happy with his gamble.“Everyone’s in a refreshed mood and wanting something dferent, and they have a bit of money to spend.“It’s kind of worked out better than it would have been before.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.42310010-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.42310010-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.42310010-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/2.42310010-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"two new coronavirus cases in grampian in the past 24 hours","story":"There have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus recorded across the north-east in the past  hours.Newly-published statistics from the Scottish Government today showed that the number of cases in Grampian remains on ,.There are  people in hospital after testing positive for the virus, up one from yesterday.The total number of deaths in Scotland remains at ,.Coronavirus is #firmly in retreat# in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday, as some changes similar to those already in place in England came into effect.They allow people who live alone or solely with under-s to meet another household indoors without physical distancing in an #extended household group arrangement#, similar to the #bubbles# in place south of the border.People can also now meet in larger groups outside, and other changes allow greater freedom for those who are shielding.More easing of lockdown is due to come into effect on Monday, when places of worship can reopen for private prayers, with social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures in place.Face coverings will become mandatory on public transport, amid an anticipated rise in use.The following Monday, non-essential shops which have street access can reopen, along with zoos, playgrounds, sports courts and some indoor workplaces, including factories.In England, the two-metre social distancing rule looks likely to be relaxed after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Prime Minister#s review #will make an enormous dference# to businesses.Boris Johnson is expected to make an announcement on pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels # with their reopening in England an ambition from July  to start reviving the economy.The Evening Express is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Evening Express from just £. a month."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 8 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRegular contributor Aileen Gillies sent us this week#s photograph, which she has called #What ewe looking at #."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRumour has it the UK government will bring in a -day quarantine for some # but not all # airline passengers at the end of this month.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side.

But locals would do well to remember it, for it may well gt us a cleaner future.Medieval surface coal workings from the th century at Preston led to a cluster of early industries in the area, including salt pans, soap making and, eventually, Fowlerrsquos brewery.But it was the th-century energy of the industrial revolution that turned Tranent into a town and founded most western villages.Those surface workings just scratched the tip of the massive Lothian coalfield, which stretches from Penicuik, out under the Forth to connect with Fersquos. Its five seams ied in width from one to three metres, the best coal lying m deep and requiring innovative deep mining technology to extract.The new steam engines solved the perennial problem of pumping out water.Being next to Morrisonrsquos Haven for easy transport, Prestongrange, by Prestonpans, was the first major pit in the s.With the help of a beam engine from Cornwall, it went deep in .A second pit with shafts under the Forth was sunk at Prestonlinks in . One shaft linked with a Fe colliery, making it possible to walk under the Forth.The  Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway opened inland pits by connecting them with Cockenzie harbour. These developed into Fleetsand Limeylandscollieries.These were linked, along with Carberryand Tynemount , to the North British Railway by the Garvald  Gford Railway.Wallyford, Whitecraig, Elphinstone, Ormiston and Macmerry all grew up to house miners working there.For - miners at each pit, working conditions were dreadful, being cramped, hot, dirty and dangerous.Mechanical diggers appeared around the time of the Second World War and pithead baths became universal only with the National Coal Boardin .The NCB dug new shallow mines like Wintonand Meadowmill , and the Monktonhall lsquosuperpitrsquo , but their future was short. All mines but Monktonhall were closed by .These forgotten mines offer more for our future than just Prestongrange Mining Museum.

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"shielding-people-scotland-can-cannot-phase-2","story":"As part of measures being eased as the country moved into Phase  of lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon revealed those people shielding would be among those to experience change immediately.There are around , people in the shielding group,which includes organ transplant recipients, those on active chemotherapy, those with severe lung disease, those with certain metabolic diseases, the signicantly immunosuppressed and pregnant women with underlying heart problems.They also included anyone primary care physicians deemed vulnerable.At the start of the pandemic they were all sent a letter telling them to stay indoors and take extra precautions until June .Last week, Nicola Sturgeon extended that, telling them that they would need to shield until the end of July.So what has changed for people shielding in Scotland Here we outline what you can and cannot do now we have moved into Phase .Irsquom in a shielding household, what CAN I do now Confirming her pledge last week, the First Minister revealed that anyone who is shielding , can nowgo outdoors for exercise ndash whether it be a walk, a wheel or cycle.But the First Minister added an extra easing.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

It is not quite fair, however, to accuse the Government of ldquodithering ndash it is weighing up the medical advice, trying to safeguard children and teachers, and essentially keeping in step with the Westminster Governmentrsquos policy, which is certainly no clearer.And in one sense, every policy in this period is a ldquocontingency or,you prefer, an aspiration. Every restriction and relaxation proposed or implemented has been dependent upon circumstances and attended by caveats declaring them subject to cancellation or reversal. That remains the case evenHolyrood and Westminster have both been guilty of misjudgment or inconsistency indeed, errors and their correction are a practically unavoidable part of that process.More decisive thinking, greater clarity and swter action are nonetheless now essential when it comes to education. Without ato something like normal schooling soon, a large section of the workforce will be hamstrung. Even more important is the urgent need to make up the shortfall already created in childrenrsquos education.Despite the stalwart efforts of many teachers, this hiatus has been damaging, and unfortunately the evidence suggests it has had a disproportionate effect on the poorest pupils, and those who for other reasons need the most support. The commitment and sacrice of inidual teachers does not always seem to have been matched by the teaching unions, which have sometimes appeared more anxious to raise objections and reasons for delay than to seek ways of making schoolsrsquo reopening viable. Edinburgh Councilrsquos plans, which could involve cutting provision by two-thirds, are equally unrealistic claiming a need for funding or resources is one thing, but essentially disregarding the future prospects of children for convenience is deplorable.As an entirely devolved issue, it is for the Scottish Government to take the decisions.

The current crisis could be the ldquofinal nail in the coffin of globalisation.The economic threat from pandemic has been heightened by ldquoa prolonged period of under-investment in developed economies. The economic response to the pandemic by governments ldquohas been uncoordinated.The threat of inflation is growing. ldquoIf inflation does start to take off then hellip there may at some point be a need to raise nominal interest rates sharply, he warns, adding: ldquoThe focus would then need to switch to what public spending would need to be cut or what taxes to raise. Given that there seems to be no appetite for spending-induced austerity now, it would seem hellip that the time to start planning for eventual tax changes is now hellip specically in terms of reforming the tax system.Therersquos likely to be ldquoa reduced appetite for risk by the private sector and an increased risk aversion with increased precautionary savings on the part of consumers and low investment by business as a consequence. Levels of debt are ldquoeyewatering. The ldquoimmediate impact of the pandemic could see ldquoa collapse in commodity prices.TAX REFORMThe damage to the economy from pandemic presents a stark choice: tax hikes or spending cuts. MacDonald says: ldquoGiven the austerity imposed after the financial crisis is one of the contributing factors to the lack of resilience in the health service and other public services during the pandemic we rule this out as an option. Which leaves taxes as the main vehicle to deliver rectitude in debt and deficit.MacDonald sees ldquothe post-Covid landscape presenting an ldquoideal opportunity to consider tax reform.ldquoIt is crucial, he says, ldquothat any tax changes that are introduced should not impede the recovery and there seems to be a growing consensus among economists that any such changes should be focussed on wealthy iniduals rather than increasing business taxes.Inequality has ldquobeen deeply intensied during the pandemic. MacDonald says: ldquoPerhaps, the time has now come for the stakeholder model of capitalism to replace the shareholder model. Fty years ago, .% of corporate revenues went to shareholders - today its %.Post-pandemic recovery will ldquorequire taxes to change. MacDonald says: ldquoGiven the large inequalities within the UK today any new system should be progressive and in large measure should avoid income and goods and services taxes.ldquoTo this end, a permanent reduction in labour taxes such as national insurance would clearly be an obvious alternative to the salary subsidies that have been given during the lockdown and would help to maintain employment levels as the recovery phase proceeds, he says.ldquoFurthermore, such a reduction in the tax wedge would give entrepreneurs the incentive to expand existing business and also invest in sectors that will become more attractive post-pandemic. It would be a mistake to pay for the lower taxes on labour by increasing corporation tax, given that an increased investment spend will be essential to permanent recovery from the recession.ldquoA wealth tax would be a credible tax on capital and is becoming increasingly popular particularly given the nature of inequalities prevalent in the UK.MacDonald also suggests a land tax as it ldquodoes not affect economic efficiency and can reduce inequality. Business rates and council tax should also be reformed, and small and medium-sized companies should be assisted by grants not loans.THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISISUnemployment in Britain is likely to hit % by the end of the year, or even in the worst-case scenario reach %. MacDonald warns: ldquoGiven the structure of the Scottish economy, the unemployment situation in Scotland is likely to be worse than that in the UK. Scotlandrsquos dependence on the oil and hospitality sectors, and high-end food and drink exports, leave the nation vulnerable.As well as ldquothe permanent shutting of some businesses, MacDonald worries about ldquothe replacement of people with technology-driven alternatives.The ldquoblight of unemployment, he says, is ldquothe inevitable consequence of the pandemic.As lockdown eases, ldquothere is considerable uncertainty over whether people will lsquobinge spendrsquo to release pent-up demand for goods hellip or will save as a precaution due to the uncertainty in the economy.The job market will change dramatically. ldquoPeople will have to train and retrain a number of times throughout their lives and governments will have to help make that possible.Post-pandemic unemployment will ldquocreate greater inequalities in society, mostly affecting the low skilled, those on low incomes and the young. The crisis risks ldquocreating a lsquolockdown generationrsquo with permanent scarring.The ldquofracturing of globalisation hellip could also lead to a sharp fall in demand from abroad. Governments will have to stimulate the economy by ldquoincreasing investment in infrastructure hellip such spending will, of course, have further implications for the fiscal deficit and public debt.RADICAL RECOVERYKey to MacDonaldrsquos vision of post-pandemic economics is ldquothe greening of the Scottish economy. This, he believes, ldquocould generate many new jobs in construction and energy. Climate change, says MacDonald, is the pandemicrsquos ldquotwin.ldquoLow-carbon-recovery could not only initiate the signicant emissions reduction needed to halt climate change but also create more jobs and economic growth than a high-carbon recovery would, he says.MacDonald believes building lsquosocial capitalrsquo - strong, positive connections between ordinary people - is another key to recovery. He cites the  million Britons who have volunteered to help during the pandemic.ldquoSocial capital is at least as important as human and physical capital in driving forward socio-economic progress, both in terms of GDP and of wider measures of prosperity such as wellbeing. However, the move in many western societies to inidualism has led to a dramatic breakdown hellip of social capital.MacDonald adds: ldquoWestern liberal democracies have moved from societies based on the market to a market society, where the market governs our lives, and where a good, asset or service only has valueit is in a market and can be priced hellip In such a society, values such as solidarity, fairness, responsibility and compassion get downplayed and undervalued,not totally ignored.The pandemic, however, has taught us that we can prioritise ldquohealth and wellbeing before economic efficiency. There is also increasing evidence that people ldquowould prefer to prioritise health and wellbeing and other societal values over economic growth once the crisis is over.ldquoIn going forward, MacDonald suggests, ldquothe UK and Scottish governments should not make GDP their exclusive target for the nationsrsquo overall wellbeing. Health, social care, the environment and quality of le also matter.Governments need to ldquoemphasise wellbeing creation as the ultimate goal of kick-starting productivity and growth, rather than a sole focus on wealth creation. This would be a ldquomajor reprioritisation of our society.Governments should have been better prepared for a pandemic. ldquoThe appropriate form of resilience in the public and private sectors could and should have been in place, MacDonald says, adding: ldquoAs in the case of climate change, the current epidemic did not happen by chance but as a result of mankindrsquos rapacious demand for global resources.Post-pandemic, ldquogreater resilience in our health and social care systems must be built in. The World Health Organisation should be strengthened to coordinate any response to future pandemics.HOW LIFE WILL CHANGEWith ldquothe demise of the current globalisation era, countries will seek to be more resilient and self-sufficient at home. Building resilience in agriculture could led to innovations such as ldquovertical farming.However, ldquohome bias in other countries would have ldquorepercussions for the UK and Scottish export markets.MacDonald predicts that the rise of working at home during the pandemic will alter the housing market, as well as ldquoleisure, and the retail and hospitality sectors. Home-working could also ldquoreshape how people live and work in the central belt in Scotland. This would have knock-on effects for the environment, the shape of cities, and road traffic as well as health and happiness.ldquoIf a vaccine is not discovered and there are further mutations of this virus then there may be a steady migration from cities, MacDonald suggests. This could have ldquoimportant implications for house prices both in and out of the city and could lead to reduced inequality.Similarly, the sht to shopping online, e-learning in education, and also telemedicine will alter how we live and work."},{"url":null,"title":"notes-africa-became-tribal-elder","story":"He spared the tribe from further losses by agreeing to become a Muslim but lost a son, who was taken as a hostage to guarantee good faith of the tribe and likely died in Arabia, far from home.His successor negotiated with officials of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium about their ancestral land round Nimule, a small bustling town on the Nile.The British official abruptly saw the way forward when several hundred silent but armed Madi rose from the dense grass surrounding the dirt airstrip on which his biplane had landed after one of the colonial soldiers rudely gestured with his rle at Chief Surur.Two years ago, I became an elder of the tribe. My elevation in status was painless. There were obligations but also a kudos or two. The upsides included being given a chair with armrests at formal meetings in the familyrsquos thatched gazebo as opposed to scrabbling round on the floor seeking a space on a grass mat.Elders are also served food first, a young niece pouring water over the hands before and after the meal, which is always eaten with the fingers of one hand.I could wear the delightfully cool Madi cotton tunic but was wary of the white turban unless a nimble-fingered girl was around to secure it. Wearing the family Reid clan tartan kilt was not approved by my African clan who tactfully observed the high temperatures and humidity would inevitably result in the scratching of itchy loins, thus lowering concentration at crucial moments in an argument.When our family were hosts, I was expected to advise on alcoholic drinks. If a fellow elder was likely, on the evidence of his previous track record, to be obstructive or overbearing, I ensured a plentul supply of home-brewed waragi, a sugar-cane based spirit, was at hand. This was offered to him by the cupful before any fraught subject was to be debated.The negative burdens were the erratic starting times of family meetings and the wildly elastic agendas of the larger community ones, which tended to be boisterous, open-ended and foodless.Worse was the procession of relatives turning up for advice at our farm during the day, although it may have been purest chance that this often coincided with the main meal being served. As a result, we built a high metal gate at our entrance that was padlocked and onlythe invisible supplicant could convince Florence, our sceptical and worldly-wise cook, of the urgency of the matter would she let them in.Our car was small and deliberately filled with empty containers and boxes to discourage would-be passengers who often did not mind where you were actually going. Such measures were not purely selfish but a matter of economic survival.It is assumed that aunts and uncles ing from the diaspora like us are rich and can continuously fund a mini-welfare state from birth, through schooling, to marriage dowries and burial feasts.Limited by language and relying on a translator, my initial contribution to meetings was confined to sucking a pipe while looking serious. I continually consulted cousins, brothers-in-law and ancient but very alert aunts who advised on what was culturally and politically acceptable.These advisers included a city lawyer, the former regional attorney general of Port Sudan, a foreign-exchange dealer, the senior procurement manager of a large government department in Juba, and our neighbour and nephew, a workaholic farmer whose cattle, chickens and goats take priority over his wives and family.Thanks to their advice, I now greet unwelcome and unasked-for comments or politically poisoned suggestions with a grunt, then slowly raise my eyes to the far-off mountains round Lake Albert where they stay, unblinking, until the message is received.Dr David Vost studied medicine at Glasgow University and is currently working at a hospital in Swaziland.

In fact, experts have issued it countless times for many years now. Had most of us been aware of this other threat, the chances are we would have dismissed it anyway as something unlikely to impact on our lives directly. In that assumption we would have been dangerously wrong.As experts at the Geneva-based World Economic Forumpointed out earlier this month, Covid- is not the only risk with the ability to quickly and exponentially disrupt the way we all live. Or, as they more succinctly described it, our ldquonew normal isnrsquot Covid- itself, itrsquos Covid-like incidents.What these experts are referring to is the inevitability of a global cyber pandemic, one that would spread faster and further than any biological virus, impacting upon, and potentially devastating, many aspects of our lives.Sounds far-fetched and too sci-fi to be believable  Then think again. Just check the news from Australia this weekend where the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has confirmed that a state-sponsored cyber attack is currently under way, targeting Australian government, business, education and political organisations. While experts say this latest attack in Australia is not particularly sophisticated, they have been so persistent there that the government felt now was the time to speak out. The same experts warned that the current hacking should serve as a wake-up call to the overall massive rise in cyber attacks and their potential to wreak havoc in the future with the outbreak of an online pandemic.One of those experts, Dan Lohrmann, writing recently for the US magazine Government Technology, detailed through the prism of the American experience the duration over which such warnings have been given and their signicance.ldquoFor more than a decade, security leaders predicted that a Cyber Pearl Harbour or Cyber   was coming that would dramatically change society as we know it, said Lohrmann.In his assessment, he cites Janet Napolitano, former US Secretary of Homeland Security, who as far back as  warned that America ldquo will, at some point, face a major cyber event that will have a serious effect on our lives, our economy and the everyday ing of our society.But as Covid- has revealed, such attacks were never only going to be limited to the US. Right now evidence is mounting daily that state-backed hackers are seizing on the Covid- pandemic to lead cyber espionage transnationally at a time when home working and anxiety about infection are making populations more vulnerable to online hacking.ldquoAttacks have always been socially engineered to prey on peoplersquos fears, habits, and ultimately, their bank accounts, but the exploitation in the Covid- era is nothing short of sinister, warned Christopher Gerg, an information security expert writing in Security magazine last month.Just how sinister is borne out by the extent to which hackers have been exploiting employees whose working environment has radically changed as a result of Covid-.ldquoWork from home is a goldmine for spies, James Lewis, cyber security expert at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, told the Financial Times recentlyldquoThe Chinese in particular benefit because it gives them more and easier targets to go after and they have the resources to take advantage of a surge in easier targets.In April, a rare joint assessment released by Britainrsquos National Cyber Security Centrendash a branch of signals intelligence agency GCHQ ndash and the USrsquo Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencyndash part of the Department of Homeland Security ndash highlighted the ldquogrowing use of Covid- in state-sponsored cyber attacks.In the parlance of what security experts call ldquoAdvanced Persistent Threat groups, hackers working on behalf of nation states such as China, Russia and Iran among many nations are making the most of the outbreak to spy on their adversaries, according to NCSC and CISA.It would be naive to imagine, of course, that both those same UK and US intelligence communities are not themselves doing likewise. Various reports have already surfaced over the extent to which numerous Chinese organisations or institutions, for example, have been the subject of scrutiny by the US, UK and others.Evidence presented in the recent US-UK joint assessment of cyber security breaches here in Britain give some idea of how the coronavirus has upped the ante of such activity on all sides.ldquoAPT groups are using the Covid- pandemic as part of their cyber operations, the US version of the report reads. ldquoTheir goals and targets are consistent with longstanding priorities such as espionage and lsquohack-and-leakrsquo operations.Underlining the scale of the threat from state entities, the Reuters news agency last month reported that hackers linked to Iran targeted Gilead, the US-based pharmaceutical company that makes the anti-Covid drug Remdesivir.According to experts who reviewed web archives for Reuters, the hacking infrastructure used in the attempt to compromise the email account of an executive at Gilead had previously been used in cyber attacks by a group of suspected Iranian hackers known by the bizarre name ldquoCharming Kitten. Such colourful or quaint code names are not uncommon in the cyber world and often veil the seriousness of such a grouprsquos impact.ldquoAccess to even just the email of staff at a cutting-edge Western pharmaceutical company could give ... the Iranian government an advantage in developing treatments and countering the disease, said Priscilla Moriuchi, a director with US cyber security firm Recorded Future, and former analyst with the US National Security Agency.Responding to the hacking claims, Iranrsquos mission to the United Nations denied any involvement in the attacks.ldquoThe Iranian government does not engage in cyber warfare, spokesman Alireza Miryousefi told the news agency. ldquoCyber activities Iran engages in are purely defensive and to protect against further attacks on Iranian infrastructure, the spokesman added.Just as in the Gilead case, other state-backed hackers are using similar email ldquolures to entice government officials, academics and employees at public health bodies into clicking on links that give access to their organisationsrsquo networks.The World Health Organisationis another recent example, reporting that it has experienced a fivefold increase in cyber attacks compared to this time last year. Some were clearly motivated by profit as much as intelligence gathering.Many of these attacks on the global health watchdog were targeted at the general public with emails that spoofed WHO employeesrsquo emails asking for donations. Common ldquophishing scams include emails claiming to come from the director-general of the WHO, and others claiming to offer thermometers and face masks.ldquoThe virus crisis has brought new intelligence requirements: countries now want to know what other governments are doing about the virus, they want to find out details about vaccines, to make sure theyrsquore aware of the latest developments, the Financial Times cited one security official as saying a few months ago.ldquoSo as well as all the usual intelligence sources theyrsquore now focusing on academic organisations that might be doing modelling, people working on public policy responses, scientists who are advising government, the official added.ldquoNation states are asking for new types of intelligence so hackers are pivoting to answer those questions.But it is attacks on the health institutions and related services at the height of the global pandemic that have both alarmed and outraged cyber security experts and others.Many point to the fact that hospitals and public-sector organisations that deal with health and social care can be particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.There are historical precedents here, of course, in the shape of the devastating global cyber attack in  that crippled computers in hospitals across the UK and cost the NHS around pound million.The so called WannaCry hack, which shut down hundreds of thousands of computers around the world with messages from hackers demanding ransom payments, hit a third of hospital trusts and % of GP practices. Around % of all NHS care was disrupted over the course of a week.The hack caused more than , appointments to be cancelled, costing the NHS pound million between May  and May  of that year, and poundm in the subsequent clean-up and upgrades to its information technology systems.The WannaCry hack caused , computers to lock out users with red-lettered error messages demanding the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. According to investigators, those responsible for the global attack were North Korean hackers known as Lazarus, an elite group. While the attack didnrsquot specically target the NHS, it spread over the internet using a leaked hacking tool developed by the US spy agency the NSA.And here lies the obvious parallel with Covid-, a cyber attack that creates an infection, but one that would spread faster and further than any biological virus. Over these past months many of us have become familiar with what is known as the R number or reproduction value by which a diseasersquos ability to spread is rated.Should the reproductive rate ndash or R ndash of Covid- be on average around two without any social distancing, then each infected person passes the virus to a couple of other people.By contrast, as cyber security experts at the World Economic Forum have recently pointed out, estimates of R of cyber attacks are  and above. One of the fastest worms ndash as they are known ndash in history was the  Slammer Sapphire worm, which doubled in size approximately every . seconds, spreading to over , infected devices in  minutes and . million devices in  hours.To give some sense of scale as to what this means, a virus with a reproductive rate of  may take only five days to infect over one billion devices.The economic impact of such a global virus and subsequent digital shutdown would, say WEF experts, be of the same magnitude or greater than what we are currently seeing as a result of Covid-.ldquoThe only way to stop the exponential propagation of cyber-Covid would be to fully disconnect all vulnerable devices from one another and the internet to avoid infection, say Professor Nicholas Davis and Algirde Pipikate, the cybersecurity experts who complied the WEF assessment.To put this in some kind of context the end result would mean millions of devices would be taken offline in a matter of days.A single day without the internet would cost the world more than  billion, while a -day global cyber lockdown could cost over  trillion.ldquoThe whole world could experience cyber lockdown until a digital vaccine was developed. All business communication and data transfers would be blocked. Social contact would be reduced to people contactable by in-person visits, copper landline, snail mail or short-wave radio, the experts added, describing a nightmarish scenario that more than mirrors Covid- and the impact it has had on all our lives economically in the past few months.Just as warnings have existed for many years over a global biological pandemic so likewise they have existed regarding a cyber pandemic. The systemic cyber attacks that we are currently witnessing have shown themselves to be both easily deployed and dangerous.The point now, say those best able to judge the sale of the threat, is to fully anticipate them and have the necessary degree of preparedness. If Covid- has taught the world anything itrsquos that even a short delay in responding can cause colossal damage.As we tentatively begin to surface from these recent dark and devastating times, it might be hard to even contemplate more potential disaster.But as we now know from painful experience, fully recognising the extent of any threat and having the measures in place to cope must be a priority.

Likewise, most felt they had not had a chance to voice opinions on its economic, environmental or social impacts. An overwhelming % felt there had not been sufficient effort put into alleviating the routersquos negative impacts, and more than % said roads had been adversely affected.:North Coast  taken over by Scotlands biggest landownerAround % of the  people who responded also indicated they were unhappy at the impact on public toilets, and more than half felt the route impacted negatively on the environment.The online survey also showed strong feelings that the NC has pushed up property prices and led to fewer homes being available for people living in the communities.Half of local business owners surveyed said they felt there were too many tourists travelling the route.The online questionnaire was devised by student Lucy Hutton as part of her final-year dissertation at SRUC, Scotlandrsquos Rural College. She said: ldquoI had expected the responses to be a bit more positive.ldquoPeople donrsquot think there is investment going back into local communities and that the stakeholders are not taking into account the problems they are facing.The survey, however, is just one indication of what appears to be mounting disquiet among a portion of residents. Social media forums buzz with comments from people anxious over what they regard as a rush to lure tourists back to areas with limited healthcare facilities.There is particular concern over recent comments by David Whiteford, chairman of the North Highland Initiative, the non-profit organisation which originally devised the NC idea. He suggested a need for more ldquouplting messages from the Scottish Government to allay residentsrsquo fears and encourage tourism, and an exploration of how the two-metre social distancing rules could be eased.His comments coincided with a survey by the business behind the route, North Coast  Ltd, which claimed % of respondents had not been put off visiting the route by the pandemic.ldquoA great many who live here are growing increasingly tired of being told whatrsquos good for us by these organisations, said one disgruntled resident who lives on the Ross and Cromarty stretch of the route.ldquoI canrsquot even hug my grandchildren.

It feeds into most peoplersquos view of the whole NC phenomenon. A lot of people feel it was foisted on them without consultation and it has changed the nature of tourism from lsquoslowrsquo to much more frantic.ldquoThey make a big deal of improved economic impact, but it has to be set against what people have lost.The NC tourism initiative was launched in .

Its lead author, Professor John Lennon, is an unpaid director at North Coast  Ltd, which promotes the route.Tom Campbell, executive chairman of North Coast  Ltd, said: ldquoWersquore very aware that businesses are part of every community and there needs to be a collective understanding of the need for businesses to open and the concerns that this has to be done by taking safe and measured steps.ldquoWe have consistently said that visitors should only travel when the Scottish Government says that it is safe to do so and we are not at that point yet.ldquoWe must ensure that there is a clear message about why tourism businesses can reopen to ensure that everyone knows that it is being done on the guidance of the Government.He added: ldquoWhether people are travelling in their own vehicle, or hiring one for their visit, we actively encourage visitors to observe our advice for safe driving on country and single-track roads, overnight parking, access rights, and waste disposal which is all available on our website.ldquoWhether people are travelling by car, bicycle, motorcycle, campervan, motorhome or foot, it is their responsibility to dispose of their waste responsibly.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Pub owners argue it will be impossible for many operators to stay open under a two-metre policy.Drinkers at pubs and bars in England may have to leave their names and contact details in a guest book so they can be swtly tracedthey come into contact with a punter who tests positive for coronavirus, according to reports. Mr Neill said that is a possibility here, but it is not something that is included in his organisation#s proposed guidelines, which are at an advanced stage.It is something that could be done, Mr Neill added.The industry representative said whatever the UK Government lays down, either today or tomorrow, will likely inform the guidance from the Executive.Apart from the social distancing rule, the industry is also keen for a date to be set to reopen non-food bars, which may be as early as July  in England and Wales. The Republic has pencilled in July  for the opening of all premises. Officials in England are understood to be looking at the guest book measure in order to fulfil the ambition of reopening the hospitality sector as early as July  and to aid the NHS test and trace programme. Diners leaving their contact details at restaurants when making reservations could also play a role in helping tracers track down possible cases so they can self-isolate for  days. Mr Hancock also said customers will be encouraged to order drinks through apps.Bars are already preparing for reopening ahead of receiving any detailed advice and guidance from the Executive and health agencies.Paul Blaney, owner of the Parador Lodge on the Ormeau Road in Belfast, has installed screens between tables among other measures, including non-touch hand sanitiser dispensers and a one-way system throughout the bar, including to and from the toilets. Mr Blaney said he particularly wants his older customers, some of them isolated in care homes or sheltered housing for months, to be comfortable and feel safe to . Other bar owners have questioned the wisdom of increased table service as staff will be moving constantly from the bar to tables, and between customers. They are also wondering about the decision to open again on a Friday rather than on a Monday or other weekday, which it is argued would allow staff to prepare better instead of being thrown in to a potential weekend rush.

Businesses normally involving close contact such as hairdressers, barbers, nail bars and beauty parlours can reopen from July .The latest steps were made possible because of the low transmission rate of coronavirus.It follows weeks of pressure on Stormont ministers for guidance on when the industry could reopen and what PPE will be needed.The sector has been closed since mid-March - putting enormous financial pressure on hundreds of businesses.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseProprietor Julie McCay FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappProprietor Julie McCayJulie McCay , who runs The Nail Room in Carrickfergus, was overwhelmed at the response from her clients following Thursday#s announcement. To say we#ve been inundated with appointment requests would be an understatement, she said.While it has been a bit overwhelming, we#re getting through the bookings as best we can.Although Covid- has impacted how we now operate, we are aiming to take as many clients as social distancing measures allow.Our loyal regulars will get first choice, which I#m sure other clients will understand.We#ve also asked those who aren#t in as much of a rush to get booked inthey maybe wouldn#t mind waiting until our second week of opening for their appointments. Julie, a mother-of-two, is looking forward to getting back to work next month after three months of lockdown, especially as her husband Sezer Askar, from Rumours Coffee House in the town, has been back in business for the last three weeks. It#s just brilliant to finally have a date to work towards and be out of the unknown, she said. I#ve had so many clients getting in touch over recent weeks begging me for appointments and I just had to tell them that until Arlenetells me it#s okay there#s nothing I can do!I have been in business for  years, and while I#ve enjoyed the time at home, I also felt really guilty that I#ve let my clients down by not being able to offer them my services. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBeauty Secrets Bangor#s owner Linzi Fisher Avery FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBeauty Secrets Bangor#s owner Linzi Fisher AveryLinzi Fisher Averyhas also been bombarded with appointment requests. She has been at the helm of Beauty Secrets Bangor for six years and is urging clients not to panic. It all went a bit crazy on Thursday night after we put a Facebook post up with the news we#d all been waiting for, Linzi said. There was this huge influx of about  messages, but we#re getting everyone booked in.Nails, brows and waxing are the main areas that our clients are prioritising. We#re still not surethere are certain treatments that we might not be allowed to give just yet, so we#re awaiting further guidance on that. The National Hair and Beauty Federationhas already published a list of guidelines to help prevent the spread of Covid- between customers and staff.The NHBF has suggested an online appointment service to create as little contact as possible and cutting out walk-ins, waiting areas and providing tea and coffee. Customers have also been urged not to wear jackets and coats in warm weather due to the virus living on fabric materials for days.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBeauty Secrets Bangor FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBeauty Secrets BangorLinzi said her clients will have a very dferent experience when they next visit the salon compared with pre-lockdown. Just like hairdressers, treatment prices will have to rise to help cover the additional cost of implementing new safety measures, including the purchase of masks, gloves and gowns. Cleaning levels will be even stricter than before and appointment times will be longer to facilitate this, Linzi explained. Clients will have to wear disposable masks and sanitise their hands on arrival.We have also installed Perspex screens over all of our counters and no walk-ins will be allowed. We#re already % of the way there in terms of our preparation and could nearly open soonerit was possible.

Enquiries into the matter are ongoing.”Cara McCann, director of HERe NI, a campaign group for lesbian and bisexual women, said the letters were “harmful and initimidating”.She added: “HERe NI reported this to the PSNI.“We will continue to support these two women and other women who get this material and would urge people to seek support from LGBT sector organisationsthey have received this or similar literature.”But Freda Kerr, who distributed the leaflets and runs the Mid-Ulster Christian Help Line with her husband, said she had “no intention of stopping” and would go to prisonshe had to.She added: “It’s God’s word, not my word. We do it by way of the literature and we do to help people and people have been helped.”Aisling Twomey, LGBT Advocacy officer at The Rainbow Project, said incidents like this were “still a reality” for many in the community.She added: “This includes assault, vandalism, harassment and emotional abuse, not to mention the anti LGBT rhetoric used by political and religious organisations.“I would encourage anyone who has received literature such as this or has experienced intimidation as a result of their sexual orientation and or gender identity to report it to the police.“If they don’t feel comfortable speaking with the police, then they can speak directly to Advocacy officer based at The Rainbow Project who can report the incident andnecessary can do so anonymously.”Belfast Most ReadUVF gang in -hour terror rampageFather#s Day: NI personalities on what makes their dads so special Firefighter axed after blazing row with his former lover reinstated and awarded £kLoyalist hits out at East Belfast mob #torturing the Protestant people#Senior Belfast republican Bobby Storey dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

Concern was recently raised that Derry City and Strabane District Council ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the local dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. He asked for vehicles using the council-owned recycling centres to be monitored to assess how big an issue it was. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. googletag.cmd.push After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures, which have been seen by the Derry News, revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed last week at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a special meeting of the committee be organised to discuss a number of issues around the recycling centres This included, he said, the dumping of commercial waste at the centres and the number of people from outside the council jurisdiction using the centres. Alderman McCready stressed that he was speaking about anyone from outside the council area, and not just people from Donegal. His proposal was supported by other councillors on the committee. Meanwhile, van drivers who use the local recycling centres are being advised of new arrangements that will come into place from this week. From today, large vans with trailers will only be permitted entry to Strathfoyle and Strahans Road sites during the following revised times - Strathfoyle, between am and am Monday to Saturday, and at Strahans Road between am and am, Monday to Saturday. No large vans with trailers will be accepted at Pennyburn dump. However, large vans will only be permitted access between am and am, Monday to Saturday. A spokesperson for the council said the new arrangements are in place to assist with traffic management arrangements and for safety reasons.

Ms Sheerin warned that beef and sheep farmers would be worst affected by the crisis and urged the Agriculture Minister to acknowledge this in the scheme. “There are , beef and sheep farmers in the north, and it is they who will be hardest hit,” she said. “As farmers face the prospect of Brexit and the severe weather, it is essential this funding should go where it is most needed. “The Agriculture Minister must heed the wishes of the Assembly before any scheme is finalised.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Toilet facilities at the Banagher Dam car park were demolished in  after they fell into disrepair. The portable toilets that replaced them were also withdrawn following a dispute between NI Water, who own the site, and the Forestry Service, who manage it. Cllr Kathleen McGurk welcomed the reopening of some sites and said reinstating toilet facilities was ‘imperative’. “It is welcome news to see the reopening of these facilities as a tentative step out of lockdown,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “This will hopefully allow many more people to enjoy the fantastic scenery and outdoor recreational spaces our council area has to offer. “However it is imperative that the toilet facilities which were once at Banagher Glen are reinstated as a matter of urgency. “It is simply not acceptable that other recreational spaces are afforded more amenities than Banagher Glen. “If we hope to attract more tourism to the Dungiven Sperrins area of the Borough we should ensure we offer a world class experience, and that must include basic amenity facilities. “I will be contacting all stakeholders, Council, NI water and Forestry Services, to ensure that they engage with each other to provide the amenities that this recreational space deserves.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

His report on the Loughinisland massacre did not find collusion in the case but was later quashedNewspapers do not stop corrupt or incompetent things happening but, in western democratic societies, theydo often uncover them. Societies such as China have no independent media scrutiny of events and no fair or independent courts, so will never get on top of problems such as their endemic corruption. Instead the Communist Party is reduced to anti corruption drives, in which officials can be executed.In China, not only is there no free press but there is no free speech or right to protest.The massacre of pro reform students for demonstrating at Tiananmen in  is expunged from history and cannot be commemorated .We don’t even know how many died in Tiananmen: estimates begin in the hundreds. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Contrast that with America where there was extensive scrutiny and soul searching over the  shooting dead of four protesting students at Kent State, Ohio. In the West even a weekly paper with a few reporters can shed light on frauds, planning disputes, etc.A regional daily paper such as this one comes out more often and so can uncover even more.A national paper has still greater resources, and can reveal yet more.In Northern Ireland, the Renewable Heat Incentive saga was, at best, an administrative shambles in which public funds were squandered. The most accessible detailed account of RHI was written by a reporter on thispaper, Sam McBride.This the world’s oldest English language daily title, founded almost  years ago, in . I have read all the earliest surviving - editions, which seem primitive compared to today, yet were revolutionary. Prior to them, news spread by rumour, town crier or pamphlet. The late Jonathan Bardon told me that much of our understanding of King William’s journey to the Boyne to fight the Catholic James II comes from his chaplain’s diary. That  battle was decades before most newspapers. They suddenly provided a single place where key developments could be relayed to the public, at fixed time intervals. From that moment the workings of society became more transparent.The quest to provide news on everything, from war to celebrity to science, is evident in those early News Letters.If you go forward  years and read s editions, they are bigger and better than the s. Society is more advanced, helped by better information.Newspapers have endured ever since, despite falling circulationsin the TV age.Lockdown has not killed papers,but it has caused circulations to fall further. In recent weeks many people have subscribed to us to support our journalism see below how to do so. Among other examples of this paper providing scrutiny to an under examined issue is our querying of the slow theto schools, which we have done for more than a month Also our querying of how the legacy of the Troubles has turned against state forces who prevented civil war. Many people do not accept such a positive assessment of the role of the state, but I thinkmore people do than do not, yet you would never know that from the way legacy is panning out .There is not space here to detail the troubling saga around the handling of complaints about the RUC response to the  Loughinisland loyalist massacre. The murders were a grievous sectarian crime but their horror cannot mean ex RUC are not entitled to due process.Reports on these pages by Mark Rainey and analysis articles have examined the case, It is a complex saga that highlights the sweeping, misleading definition of collusion.The controversy began when the then Ombudsman Al Hutchinson issued a report which did not find collusion in the killings. Dr Michael Maguire, who as criminal justice inspector criticised that report, later became ombudsman. When the first report was quashed, he issued a new one that did find collusion.In , Mr Justice McCloskey was highly critical of the Maguire findings of collusion, as “unsustainable in law”. He said RUC officers “were, in effect, accused, tried and convicted without notice and in their absence. None of the essential elements of the criminal or disciplinary process existed”.It was devastating verdict. But then there was a highly unusual allegation of bias against him, which he firmly rejected, yet stood aside even so . There are grave doubts as to the appropriateness of him recusing himself in that way.Ms Justice Keegan later issued a completely dferent ruling to McCloskey. Wednesday’s appeal court ruling on Loughinisland, while it criticised Dr Maguire overstepping the mark in his collusion findings , does not settle the matter. In this country we have a fine legal system and are free to criticise it, yet papers rarely do, such is the deference to judges. I still believe that the case is so serious that it should to the Supreme Court to get complete clarity as to the legal position. At the same time, in case the case is lost, London must also be ready to act to stop its like ever happening again.The BBC Newsline report on Thursday went big on collusion being upheld, with a brief mention of the over-stepping criticism.We will continue to examine the case and consider the extent to which the security forces can get a fair hearing on legacy matters.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: We also led way in sceptical reporting of slowto schools• Court of Appeal rules Police Ombudsman ‘overstepped the mark’ in Loughinisland findings——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Was there a breakdown in communication at the executive or was it Mr Weir and the Department of Education caving in after outcry at the teachers’ union  Education leaders and politicians need to acknowledge that part-time education, be it one, two or even three days a week, and supplemented by home-schooling, will not be enough for long-suffering children.

Columnist: Sandra Chapman \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The queue seemed to be a mile long at the supermarket and I studied it for a while before I got out of the car. I have a bad back as well. How long would I survive in the long wait to get in  All questions I never ever had to consider in the past. How times have changed.There was nothing for it but to join the queue – at least it wasn’t raining – and everyone one  seemed civilised and patient. A person not endowed with a lot of patience at the best of times, I gritted my teeth, buttoned up my coat and took my place. Surprisingly, the queue was moving faster than it appeared from the car. An older, grey haired lady joined the queue somewhere behind me. A member of staff, who had obviously sized up those waiting, signalled to the grey haired lady to come forward and she took her ahead of us explaining to the rest of us that anyone  or over gets priority. I told the lady in front – a complete stranger to me - that I was in my th year and I suppose that wouldn’t count. Quick as a flash she hailed the member of staff, still with the grey haired one in tow, and informed her I was in my th year. The staffer said the company had set the age at , but then she must have taken pity on me as she signalled for me to come forward. I thanked my new found benefactor in front of me and headed off, mask and rubber gloves in place. I would like to think all those others in the queue thought that as I didn’t look nearly  why was I getting preference Obviously this lockdown hasn’t deprived me of my vanity when it comes to preferential treatment, but wearing a mask and rubber gloves did upset it somewhat. Inside the store, not that many shoppers were kitted out in the same garb. Is this a sign that everyone is fed up to the teeth with Covid- and are taking a chance that it won’t jump out and bite them when they’ve relaxed their personal security Remembering about the arrows on the floor was dficult as I kept ing off to grab an item I was looking for. But where was the counter for those specialist foods I was after  I’ve starved myself long enough and didn’t plan to go home without something I could eat. Eventually, several arrows later, it came into view. The contents of every item I needed had to be thoroughly read, a task which took time and left me perspiring behind the mask and my glasses steaming up.My spirits rose somewhat when I realised I could get nice things like mousses, biscuits with chocolate,and cakes. I packed the trolley with gluten free pastas and, mercully, they had feta cheese, as all other cheese is right off my menu now. Lockdown or not I wasn’t going to starve or spend nights eating nothing but potatoes and salad without tomatoes, another no-no for me.Himself was greatly impressed when I got home. No more moaning from me about what I can’t eat.Gallantly, he offered to eat the same menu. I think this was due to his idea that he wouldn’t have to do the shopping any longer. But, would he survive eating fake chocolate, chips without the flour, noodles and bread that feels as though it was baked a year ago  I think he would be visiting the chippy a lot.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebadfeaafdde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dacebdacdfceac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
