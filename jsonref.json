He was diagnosed with a deadly disease, and his expectations dropped to zero.\u0027He himself said that everything that happened since then was a bonus. And what a triumph his life has been.’ Here is all the information on Stephen Hawking including his net worth, books and scientific theories.Who was Stephen Hawking?Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942 in Oxford. His parents, Frank and Isobel Hawking both attended Oxford University, where they studied medicine and Philosophy, Politics and Economics respectively.The Hawkings moved to Oxford from London to escape the WWII rockets and moved again, to St Albans, when Hawking was eight. He attended St Albans School and then University College, Oxford, in 1959, at the age of 17.          Stephen Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother EdwardHawking actually wanted to study mathematics at Oxford but his college didn’t offer the course, so he chose physics.After getting a First class degree, in 1962 Hawking went to Cambridge to conduct research in the field of cosmology.Three years later, Hawking received his doctorate for his thesis, Properties of Expanding Universes\u0027. Soon after, Hawking would publish his first academic text, \u0027The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time\u0027.In 1963, Hawking’s ALS diagnosis, at the age of 21, threw the young scientist into a pit of severe depression.\u0027My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus,’ he said in an interview in The New York Times, December 2004.However, he soon overcame it, particularly since his condition was deteriorating at a much slower rate than initially expected, and returned to his work.Stephen Hawking\u0027s theories Throughout the 1970s, Hawking’s research focused on the nature of black holes. He first posited that the event horizons of black holes cannot get smaller and subsequently got into a famous argument with Dr Jacob Bekenstein over the matter.Bekenstein was ultimately proven right that black hole entropy exists and thus, event horizons do decrease over time. Hawking went on to postulate the existence of black hole radiation, which ultimately became known as Hawking radiation. Hawking actually wanted to have the Hawking radiation formula engraved on his tombstone, according to the New York Times. During the 1980s. Hawking expanded his focus to cover the wider concepts of the universe: its creation and its creations.Hawking argued that galaxies were formed in the time directly after the Big Bang, suggesting that quantum fluctuations evolved into them after being bumped together by gravitational forces.Hawking is perhaps most famous for his search for ‘the theory of everything’ a theory that manages to reconcile Quantum theory with Einstein’s theory of general relativity.The former focuses on the miniscule subatomic particles that comprise the fabric of the universe, while the latter concerns itself with its largest aspects and concepts.Such a theory would, Hawking said, allow Man to ‘know the mind of God’.In 1983, Hawking collaborated with Professor Jim Hartle on the Hartle-Hawking state, a proposal of a ‘wave function of the universe’.In 1988 Hawking published ‘A Brief History of Time’, a book that explored and explained the concepts of the universe for a layman audience. It became an international bestseller and has sold over 10 million copies since publication. Stephen Hawking marriagesStephen Hawking married fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde, in 1965 and the couple were together for 25 years, orcing in 1991, although Hawking had moved out of the family home in 1990. Wilde wrote a book about their relationship entitled ‘Music to Move the Stars’.Hawking married Elaine Mason, who was one of his nurses in the late 80s in September 1995. They were together until 2006.Since then, Hawking grew closer again to Jane and their three children, resulting in Wilde’s book being revised and subsequently adapted into the 2014 film, The Theory of Everything, which starred Eddie Redmayne as Hawking.What was Stephen Hawking’s net worth?Stephen Hawking’s net worth was estimated to be $20 million (£14.3m), according to Celebrity Net Worth.How did Stephen Hawking make his money?The majority of Stephen Hawking’s net worth is thought to have come from the sales of his incredibly popular book ‘A Brief History of Time’.In 2012, Hawking won the Fundamental Physics Prize, whose $3 million (£1.8m) is the largest prize in science.Hawking’s mainstream breakthrough in 1988 saw the scientist make many TV appearances and shows.He appeared in shows such as The Simpsons, Star Trek, The Big Bang Theory and A Brief History of Time was turned into a series in 1992."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5518355/What-Vladimir-Putin-net-worth.html","title":"What is Vladimir Putin’s net worth?","story":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has won a fourth term in office with 77 percent of the voteAlongside being one of the most powerful men in the world, the Russian President may also be one of the richest, but what is Vladimir Putin’s net worth?Who is Vladimir Putin?Born Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin on October 7, 1952 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union or what is now referred to as Saint Petersburg, he was the youngest child of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin and Maria Ivanova Putina.At first, Putin was one of the few in his class who was not part of the Young Pioneer organisation but later, after taking classes in sambo and judo, he became interested in the intelligence officers that were portrayed in some Soviet films.During his time at university, he was required to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and he remained a member until 1991. This is also where he met Anatoly Sobchak, a professor who would later be a great influence to Putin.After graduating in 1975, Vladimir joined the KGB and trained at a school in Okhta, Leningrad before working in counter-intelligence and then was responsible for monitoring foreigners and consular officials.Putin then served in Dresden, East Germany using a cover as a translator and according to his biography, at this time, he burned KGB files to prevent demonstrators from obtaining them during the fall of the Berlin Wall.The collapse of the Communist East German government led to Putin returning to Saint Petersburg where he worked at the University, searched for new KGB recruits and renewed his friendship with Sobchak, who was the Mayor of the city at the time.In 1991, Vladimir resigned from his role as the Lieutenant Colonel on the second day of the Soviet coup d\u0027état attempt on President Mikhail Gorbachev and this is when his political career began.Vladimir Putin’s political careerPutin started out in politics as an international affairs advisor to Mayor Sobchak and a year later, became the head of the Committee for External Relations, working with global relations related to foreign investments.During his time there, Vladimir was investigated for understating prices and exporting metals valued at $93 million (£66m) in exchange for food aid that never arrived. Putin remained in his role despite this until 1996 and was involved in politics outside of work.Vladimir’s other roles included the appointment as First Deputy Chairman of the Government of Saint Petersburg, organising the city’s branch of the Our Home - Russia political party and managing the legislative election campaign for that party.After Mayor Sobchak lost his re-election bid, Putin moved to Moscow where his responsibilities included organising the transfer of the Soviet Union and Communist Party’s former assets to the Russian Federation. His tenure in this role lasted until March 1997.Vladimir was then appointed deputy chief of Presidential Staff by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and went on to rise in the ranks before becoming the Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) a year later.  Who is Vladimir Putin’s wife?Vladimir Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva in 1983 and the couple had two daughters, Mariya Putina and Yekaterina Putina.Although Putin is notoriously secretive about his personal life, Vladimir and Lyudmila are thought to have separated in 2013.Putin has been linked to the Russian ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva who gave birth to a baby in 2015 but rumours that it is Vladimir’s baby have been discredited. Alina has also been seen wearing a ring on her wedding ring finger.What is Vladimir Putin’s net worth?Vladimir Putin’s net worth has accumulated to approximately $70 billion (£50bn), according to Celebrity Net Worth.While his net worth has been a subject of discussion, ahead of March 18, 2018, the Russian President was asked to declare his average yearly salary to the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation.Putin declared that he earned 38.5m rubles, or $673,000 (£478,000) between 2011 and 2016, resulting in his annual income totalling $112,000 (£79,600). He also listed assets including 13 bank accounts with a sum of $241,000 (£171,000) and 230 shares in Bank Saint Petersburg, two Volga vehicles and an 800-square-foot apartment in Saint Petersburg.However, some believe that Putin may have more money that he is revealing in 2015, CEO of Hermitage Capital Management Bill Browder calculated that Putin’s net worth was $200 billion (£142bn), which would make him the richest man in the world, above Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s net worth of $121 billion (£86bn).Alongside this, his stakes in several companies cannot be verified but rumours suggest that the Russian President controlled 37 percent of oil company Surgutneftegaz, 4.5 percent of natural gas company Gazprom and, according to the U.S Treasury, he had substantial holdings in commodities trader Gunvor, although the crude oil trading company has always denied any links to Putin.Vladimir is also thought to own a palace on the Black Sea with a reported worth of $1 billion (£710m), allegedly paid for by a secret slush fund created by Russian oligarchs. In addition to this, there are also rumours circulating that he has 20 palaces, four yachts, 58 aircraft and a watch collection worth over £400,000."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5537713/Mail-petition-contract-UKs-new-blue-passport-British-firm.html","title":"Mail petition: Give the contract for the UK\u0027s new blue passport to a British firm","story":"      The Government had decided the post-Brexit blue passports should be made by a European companyA Daily Mail and MailOnline petition to have Britain\u0027s post-Brexit blue passports made by a British company has gained more than 285,000 signatures. The Government had decided the passports should be made by a European company.But the Daily Mail and MailOnline called on ministers to put British workers first by reversing the decision and giving the contract to a British firm. Now you can add your voice too – simply enter your name, email address and home town into the form below to add YOUR voice - the total will be regularly refreshed so you can see how you\u0027ve made a difference. Be assured, your details will be kept confidential. If you can\u0027t see the entry form details, simply copy and paste this address into your browser, or click here: www.dailymail.co.ukpassportsTOTAL SO FAR: 285,547Our grand total above includes both online and postal signatories.You can also share this page with your friends and family by using the links below:"},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5568033/The-day-Meghan-Markle-let-ruthless-show.html","title":"The day Meghan Markle let her ruthless side show","story":"    Meghan Markle and her former husband Trevor Engelson pictured together in 2006When Meghan Markle made the decision to end her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson in 2013, she acted swiftly — and some might say callously.Instead of flying from her new home in Toronto to Los Angeles, where the couple had shared a bungalow, to return her engagement and wedding rings in person, she simply sent them back to him by post.Engelson, whom she’d met when she was an aspiring actress and who’d mentored her to stardom in the TV series Suits, had been devastated by his wife’s ‘out of the blue’ request for a orce barely two years after they married.But it was not the first indignity he had suffered. Even before she called time on their marriage, when she moved to Canada to take up that starring role in the TV drama Suits, she took with her their expensive food-mixer.According to a revealing new biography of Ms Markle, it was a statement of intent — and of her newfound independence.‘She was her own woman now, earning a steady income, making new friends on-set and off, no longer dependent on her husband’s connections,’ the author writes. ‘A £360 Vitamix blender symbolised the ide.‘She insisted her favourite kitchen appliance from their West Hollywood home come with her to Toronto. She packed it into the back-seat of her car. It then sat on the kitchen counter in the Toronto house — a material reminder that her home was no longer in Los Angeles.’          Meghan was married to film producer Trevor for two years who gave her a small role in the film Remember MeIt is an image far removed from what we have seen thus far of the royal bride-to-be — a sweet-natured and compassionate woman who can barely believe her good fortune at becoming engaged to a prince.Doubtless there is a measure of truth in this. However, in his book, to be published this month, renowned royal biographer Andrew Morton portrays the 36-year-old actress in a very different light, suggesting a far more complex — and possibly calculating — character.Though Morton describes it as ‘an old-fashioned story of a local girl makes good’, he shows how Meghan has harboured dreams of becoming a princess since she was a teenager. Her ambition is to ‘become Diana 2.0’, according to her closest school friend.          Meghan is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19 after they began a romance in 2016In extracts published this weekend, the author also presents Meghan’s capacity for ruthlessness, describing how she has expunged people she once held dear from her life as she set about elevating her social and professional status.Morton’s depiction of Meghan builds on my own portrayal of her in an exclusive Daily Mail series last year, and draws on many of the same sources. However, the author who made his name in 1992 with Diana: Her True Story, which exposed her shockingly dysfunctional marriage to Charles, takes the extraordinary narrative further.It begins with Meghan’s own dysfunctional upbringing, which did much to shape her character. Her father, Thomas, was a leading Hollywood lighting director in his mid-30s when he met her mother, Doria, who was 12 years his junior and temping in his studio as a make-up artist. They married and were overjoyed when, a year later, Meghan was born, in August 1981.But their happiness was fleeting. As Morton recounts, they lived in a predominantly white suburb where neighbours would mistake her black mother for the nanny or nursemaid. On top of this bigotry, Thomas worked 80 or 90 hours a week, leaving his young wife to care alone for Meghan and her step-siblings, Thomas Junior and Yvonne (who later took the name Samantha) — her husband’s teenage children by his first marriage.With baby Meghan the apple of her father’s eye, her half-sister resented her from the outset. And while she was upstairs in her crib, Thomas Jnr, then 15, admitted to Morton that he would smoke cannabis downstairs with his friends.Matters came to a head when his father caught them passing round a joint. To get them out of the house, he dreamt up a grotesque ruse. After changing Meghan’s nappy, he fetched a spoon from the kitchen and pretended to eat from it, Morton writes.In fact, he had filled a clean nappy with chocolate pudding, but his son’s friends were duly repulsed and never returned. By the time Meghan was two years old, Doria had had enough and moved out, though four years would pass before her parents orced. As they shared custody of her, Meghan was shunted between them.          The royal bride-to-be during her time as a \u0027briefcase girl\u0027 on Deal or No DealAccording to one of her teachers, this caused Meghan difficulties — ‘one parent over here, one over there, neither of them particularly fond of each other’.However, according to a school-friend, mediating between the warring factions taught Meghan how to control her emotions.At two, her had parents enrolled her in the Little Red School House, an exclusive creche for stars’ children, where she began performing in plays. At one of her early performances, a girl with tangled blonde hair, jam-jar glasses and an awkward manner was in the chorus line. Today, Scarlett Johansson is the world’s highest paid actress.Yet Meghan’s early introduction to showbusiness also had disquieting overtones. At nine, her father, who was then working on the raunchy comedy Married With Children, would pick her up from school then take her to the set with him.There, she sat quietly in a corner, watching the enactment of scenes possibly too candid for a little girl’s eyes, involving semi-nudity and risqué sexual jokes. As Meghan said pointedly later: ‘It was a very perverse place to grow up. I went to Catholic school.’Around this time, in 1990, her father had a stroke of luck, although it quickly turned sour.      Last autumn, when their engagement was imminent and a meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace beckoned, Morgan writes revealingly, Meghan prepared for the occasion by making secret excursions to the Rose Tree Cottage — ‘a little slice of England in LA’, where she practiced sipping tea.It was to be the biggest moment of her life — and Meghan was determined to rehearse her part to perfection."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5568769/Elon-Musk-makes-light-Teslas-woes-April-1-Twitter-prank.html","title":"Elon Musk says Tesla has \u0027gone bankrupt\u0027 in April Fool\u0027s Day prank","story":"    Elon Musk teased \u0027important news\u0027 to his 20million Twitter followers on Sunday before announcing that electric car maker Tesla had \u0027gone bankrupt\u0027The prank came amid reports of significant risks ahead for the manufacturer, which is heavily indebted and has not turned a profit since it began operating in 2003.It has lost about a quarter of its share value since the end of February, and is also currently under investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) following a fatal accident involving one of its cars in California on March 23rd.Massive robot bees will find a place for mankind to live on...Aliens could be living in the acid clouds of Venus say Nasa...Share this articleTesla confirmed on Saturday its \u0027Autopilot\u0027 feature was engaged during the accident but said the driver ignored repeated visual and audio warnings and his hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the vehicle\u0027s collision with a highway barrier.The car caught fire before two other cars struck it.

But in the same period, just 71,133 reports – less than 10 per cent – were investigated. The figures show that 8,214 people were prosecuted, representing just 1 per cent of cases.Asked if the public should accept that in the majority of cases fraudsters won’t brought to justice, Mr Dyson said: ‘I think that’s the case now, but it’s a subtle message. I would want people to report it, but to understand that it’s more about saying you can’t enforce your way out of this problem.          ‘Enforcement is a key element of it but what we can do is take all the intelligence we have got to provide better protection for the public.’He added: ‘I want people to be realistic about the outcome so I think it is about saying I am reporting this because it helps the police to protect everyone against this.‘If it is the case where we know fairly early on that there is no realistic chance of prosecution, because all we have got to go on is an anonymous IP address and it’s probably somewhere in a jurisdiction that we would find challenging, we have got to be honest and say that is not one that we can take forward.’ Last year his force advertised a fake website on Facebook to raise awareness of ticketing fraud. It offered spoof tickets for sellout gigs, and fooled 1,500 people. Mr Dyson said: ‘In eight hours we would have taken £75,000 had we chosen to.‘So why would you rob a bank when you can actually operate at that scale and that is a really simple methodology?          ‘You do not need to be a computer scientist – you just need to prey on vulnerability.’In the past year the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau run by Mr Dyson’s force shut down 170,856 bank accounts, websites and phone lines associated with fraud. He said the public tended to lose their ‘common sense hackles’ when they go online and the number of victims will continue to rise as more of our business is done online.The commissioner revealed that he fell victim to fraudsters three years ago: ‘Someone spent Christmas in a Travelodge on my credit card then tried to renew their car insurance and that was a big chunk of money so the bank alerted me.’He said the police will always need more resources to tackle cyber crime, but the solution was not to haul officers off the beat to hunt for online offenders, adding: ‘When it happened to me, I was a bit p***ed off that someone had used my bank account, to be honest.‘But would I vote to say I want to see less officers patrolling the area because of that?‘I’m not sure… there is a balance to be had.’  "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5570979/The-tantalising-baby-clues-Kate-Zaras-Royal-bumps.html","title":"The tantalising baby clues behind Kate and Zara\u0027s Royal bumps","story":"Dress like the Duchess in a tailored brown coat by Catherine WalkerClick to check out the current collectionShe\u0026#39s just weeks away from giving birth and the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out to the Easter Church Service today looking incredibly chic in a tailored brown coat by Catherine Walker.The Chelsea-based designer is well known for her upmarket couture famously worn by Princess Diana and Kate\u0026#39s mother Carole Middleton.

The Duchess of Cambridge while pregnant with George (left) and Charlotte (right)This causes bloating and may make the stomach swell before the womb itself has increased in size. In second and third pregnancies, this happens more quickly and the bump gets bigger. Kate’s bump with Prince George, her first child, born in 2013, was smaller and neater.Also a swelling uterus causes abdominal muscles and ligaments to stretch, and though these constrict again after the birth, they will never regain their pre-pregancy tautness.

That’s because the stomach muscles hold it in place.Fergie’s constant up and down battle with her weight has been well documented over the years — and in her first pregnancy she was comfort eating, hence the large bump.

Because I use contactless so much, I do tend to put my card in my back pocket — it\u0027s just so much easier.\u0027 Bethan didn\u0027t realise it was missing until early the next morning and immediately called her bank, HSBC.\u0027The bank told me that no transactions had gone through during the evening. I thought, thank goodness, I\u0027ve sorted it out before anything happened.\u0027 Her card was cancelled and a new one sent out. No harm was done — though she vowed to stop putting her card in her back pocket.But then something rather strange happened.About a week later, while checking her bank account online, she noticed a series of small purchases.\u0027I was sure at first that I hadn\u0027t made them,\u0027 she says. \u0027Some were just £2 or £3 and all were under £20 at places like Tesco, or a takeaway chicken shop. \u0027That couldn\u0027t be me, I thought — I can\u0027t remember the last time I went to a chicken shop. \u0027And there was a payment at a dog grooming parlour, and I do have a dog — but he\u0027s a beautiful mutt and not the sort of dog you groom.\u0027The purchases, all made by someone else, added up to well over £100. But because they had all been under the contactless limit of £30, they had gone through — even though the card had been cancelled.When Ms Davies queried this with her bank, she learned that it was a \u0027quirk\u0027 of contactless technology. Incredibly, in a small number of cases, a cancelled card used to continue to function for a time and no one was exactly sure why.          But the rise of contactless has led to the relentless rise of contactless fraudWhile banks will refund any losses incurred after the card has been cancelled, her experience is just one alarming example of contactless fraud, now the fastest growing area of card fraud in the UK. The technology makes consumers vulnerable in several ways.Contactless has become the default for nearly all debit and most credit cards in Britain. In the space of three years the number of cards has doubled, from 59 million in the UK in 2015 to 119 million by the end of 2017. Undeniably convenient — you just tap the card on a reader without having to type in a PIN — they have been welcomed by banks and retailers.Shopkeepers like them because their ease of use seems to encourage consumers to spend a bit more money. Banks like them because as people use contactless more, they use cash less, and handling notes and coins is cumbersome and expensive. But the rise of contactless has led to the relentless rise of contactless fraud.Figures published this month show that losses — such as that experienced by Ms Davies — climbed to £14 million last year, up from £6.9 million the previous year and £2.8 million in 2015, according to Financial Fraud Action UK. Let us pay! Church of England introduces contactless payment...Share this articleFor the first time, contactless fraud has overtaken cheque fraud, which totalled £9.8 million last year.UK Finance, which represents banks and card issuers and also runs Financial Fraud Action UK, says the statistic is to be expected. Fewer people are writing cheques and contactless is very popular. They add that contactless fraud is — in relative terms — a small problem.Not so, say other financial experts. With £52 billion spent on contactless cards last year, they believe the official fraud figures are a significant underestimate.And when one of the most senior women in the City lets it be known that she does not use contactless, then perhaps it\u0027s time we all thought again about our blase use of the technology. Last month Victoria Cleland, chief cashier of the Bank of England, whose signature is on every banknote, said: \u0027I do hear stories of friends — this is a personal anecdote, this isn\u0027t the official Bank view — whose money has been taken off contactless when you walk past something.\u0027And it\u0027s only up to £30. So I use cash for lower transactions anyway and for big ones contactless wouldn\u0027t work.\u0027Can this really be true? Can money be \u0027taken off\u0027 your contactless card by a \u0027digital pickpocket\u0027, standing beside you with a card reader?           Some phones can double as a card reader, courtesy of an app called \u0027credit card reader NFC\u0027In theory at least, it can — and quite easily.To realise how, one needs to understand the technology behind contactless cards.When you tap one on a reader in a shop, or when you get on a bus, your card details are transferred to the reader wirelessly using a radio wave.The banking industry insists that someone needs to be within two inches of the reader for it to work. But research challenges that claim.In a study published in the Journal of Engineering in 2013, scientists at the University of Surrey said they had \u0027successfully received contactless transmission from distances of 18 to 31 inches . . .\u0027So, anyone with a hand-held card reader — what waiters use when you pay your bill — could key in sums up to £30 and take money off your card by standing close to you.In practice, however, nearly all experts say this sort of \u0027digital pickpocketing\u0027 is highly unlikely. That\u0027s not because it\u0027s not possible — simply that it\u0027s likely that a criminal would be caught.          A card skimming device. For the first time, contactless fraud has overtaken cheque fraud, which totalled £9.8 million last yearKaty Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, explains that for someone to get hold of a \u0027merchant\u0027s terminal\u0027 — the type of reader retailers use to take cash from your card — would require being registered as a retailer and going through security checks.And anyone who used such a device to steal cash would be traceable. \u0027We have never seen an incident reported, where someone has lost money in that way,\u0027 she says.But stealing cash from someone\u0027s card contactlessly is not the only problem. The biggest threat to consumers is having their contactless card details \u0027skimmed\u0027 — when a fraudster doesn\u0027t steal cash, but takes card details — using a simple bit of kit which you can buy, legally, for £20 on eBay. Or even simpler, you can download an app onto a mobile phone and use the phone as a card reader. They don\u0027t take cash but do read card details.\u0027It\u0027s a dinner party trick of mine,\u0027 explains Nigel Swabey, an entrepreneur who runs mail order company, Scotts of Stow and has an interest in card fraud. \u0027You hold up the phone to the pocket of a guest and say: \u0027Ah, it\u0027s an Amex, I see. Your number is this, and your expiry date is this.\u0027 They freak out.\u0027It works like this. The latest smartphones have contactless technology in-built so they can double up as contactless cards — so instead of tapping a card on a reader, we can tap our phones. But that same technology also means some phones can double as a card reader, courtesy of an app called \u0027credit card reader NFC\u0027. It is completely legal and free.          The biggest threat to consumers is having their contactless card details \u0027skimmed\u0027 — when a fraudster doesn\u0027t steal cash, but takes card details — using a simple bit of kit which you can buy, legally, for £20 on eBay Mr Swabey believes contactless cards are skimmed on a regular basis — and card details sold to criminals, who use them to either clone a card or make fraudulent purchases.Such is his concern — and seeing a marketing opportunity — he bought the European rights to an Australian-designed wallet, called Skim Guard, which has a chip embedded into it. It can tell if any device is trying to connect with the contactless cards inside the wallet and jam the signal.Many other (usually simpler) protection wallets are available, and have been given out by Police Scotland at the Edinburgh Festival, while various councils, including St Albans, have issued them to residents.Despite this, the banks continue to dismiss such concerns and claim wallet manufacturers and retailers are whipping up conspiracy theories. What is not in doubt is that it requires only a very simple bit of kit to read the long card number and the expiry date off any contactless card if you are within a few inches of it.The banks do concede this is a potential risk, but also maintain that having just the long card number and expiry date is pretty useless to criminals.\u0027While it may be possible to copy the information off the card, it doesn\u0027t get you anywhere,\u0027 says Ms Worobec at UK Finance. \u0027There are very limited circumstances you can use this in. Most retailers require the security, or CVV, number on the back.\u0027 Yes, most online retailers insist you give the CVV code — the three digit security code on the back of the card which can\u0027t be read by a skimmer. But not all do — including the UK\u0027s fifth largest retailer, Amazon.You can type in any name and address, provide the long card number and expiry date of a card and buy something of any value — well over £30.The retailer does not necessarily cross-reference the card number with any billing address. Similarly, many non-UK websites do not ask for a CVV.In a 2015 investigation consumer organisation Which? used a simple card-reading device to skim details off ten cards.           In Africa, Asia and America, card security is not as strict as in Europe and for most purchases all that is needed is the long card number and the expiry dateEven without the names of the cardholders and the CVV code, the Which? team were able to make two purchases, one for a £3,000 TV online.Experts believe criminals are exploiting contactless technology to steal tens of thousands of card details which they sell to be used on \u0027cloned\u0027 cards overseas. In Africa, Asia and America, card security is not as strict as in Europe and for most purchases all that is needed is the long card number and the expiry date.Aggie Leighton, 36, from West London, believes this happened to her. The IT manager, who also runs money-saving website Savvycomper, received a text from her bank, Barclays, to warn her she had gone overdrawn. \u0027I couldn\u0027t work it out. Nearly £800 had left my account in the space of a few hours, while I had been asleep,\u0027 she says.When she checked her account online, she found eight transactions had been made — in Chicago. \u0027The first had been a small amount at a petrol station, but then the fraudster went to a shop and restaurant. It looked like they went on a real spending spree.\u0027Ms Leighton had never been to the U.S., let alone Chicago. She is convinced her card was cloned by a criminal who had obtained her card details via an electronic skimmer. \u0027I can\u0027t be 100 per cent sure,\u0027 she says. \u0027But it was around this time that I started to use my contactless card on the London Underground, so I had my card out a lot of the time.\u0027She was reimbursed the full amount, although it took numerous phone calls and bank visits.Significantly, Ms Leighton\u0027s case — a victim whose card was cloned and used overseas — is not recorded under contactless card figures.The banks record this type of crime as \u0027card not present\u0027 or \u0027remote card\u0027 fraud, not \u0027contactless\u0027 — despite contactless technology, in all probability, allowing it to happen.Last year, this type of fraud totalled £409 million — overshadowing the official UK contactless fraud figure of £14 million.It is, for the moment, impossible to say what proportion of this larger figure was due to criminals here electronically skimming the contactless cards of shoppers, commuters and tourists in Britain, and then selling the numbers."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5571423/RAF-veteran-pilot-82-relives-split-second-decision-fly-busy-Tower-Bridge.html","title":"RAF veteran pilot relives decision to fly through busy Tower Bridge","story":"    Former RAF Pilot Alan Pollock at his home near GuildfordRAF pilot Alan Pollock has only seven seconds to make a life-and-death decision. He’s just feet above the waters of the River Thames in a fighter jet travelling at 300 miles per hour.Less than half a mile ahead, blocking his way, is Tower Bridge. He can see that it’s busy with pedestrians and that a double decker bus is driving slowly across it. Should he fly through?In the end, he decided to go for it.It was April 5, 1968. Harold Wilson was prime minister, there were protests against the Vietnam War in London, and the Beatles’ Lady Madonna was No. 1.The start of the month had also marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Air Force. The RAF was much loved — the feats of the pilots in the Battle of Britain were still fresh in the memory, and the new generation of jet pilots were in the front line of Britain’s Cold War defence.Thirty-two-year-old Flight Lieutenant Alan Pollock was one of those pilots. He had joined the RAF in 1953 and had risen through the ranks, gaining experience in aircraft including de Havilland’s Vampire jet fighter and its successor the Venom.He had served in Germany and the Middle East and as an aide-de-camp to Air Marshal Sir Humphrey Edwardes-Jones during his time as Nato Air Commander.Alan loved the RAF and felt its 50th anniversary should be celebrated with a flypast over London. There had been an official dinner and a few parades — but no flypast. This, he felt, was a terrible slight.‘One thing that was in the Air Force’s blood was that you celebrated in the air, not on the ground,’ Alan, now 82, says at his home in Surrey.He was serving at the time in No. 1 Squadron. This is the RAF’s oldest unit and as such he believed it had a responsibility to take the lead in ensuring the half-centenary was celebrated properly.Alan decided to take matters into his own hands by staging a flypast of his own.On April 4, Alan and three other Hunter pilots from his squadron had flown from their base at West Raynham in Norfolk to RAF Tangmere in Sussex, the former home of No. 1 Squadron, where they were helping to celebrate the base being given the freedom of the city of Chichester. He decided that the following day, on their way back, he would make a detour over the capital.‘It was worth flying over London, even if I was going to get court-martialled,’ Alan says. At the very least, a trial would give him a chance to have his say on the problems facing the Air Force.Battle of Britain squadron leader, 96, takes to the skies in...Spitfire ace, 96, who shot down his first enemy plane at 19...\u0027Through adversity to the stars\u0027: RAF issues fascinating...Tornado jets are to be AXED from the RAF even though the...Share this articleSoon after the Hunters took off on the morning of April 5, Alan slipped away from the others.By tapping out coded messages using the transmitter button on his radio, he told his colleagues he had lost visual contact and that he was having problems maintaining spoken communication.All Alan had with him for reference was a borrowed AA map, on which he had marked a route across London. Within a few minutes and keeping low to avoid commercial air traffic, he reached Heathrow Airport where he turned right and headed for Richmond Park and then the Thames.Flying over the river would be the safest and quietest route through the capital. ‘I went over the Thames because I didn’t want to cause any trouble,’ Alan says.His memories of the flight are vivid. The Hunter was flying in a ‘gin-clear’ blue sky and ‘one felt like Gulliver looking down at Lilliput’. He dropped to about 150 feet and began to fly over the bridges, keeping to the middle of the river and looking out for helicopters.Alan, angry at defence cuts and what he saw as the Labour government’s complicity in the lack of celebrations for the anniversary, headed for Parliament and Downing Street. As he crossed Vauxhall Bridge he saw Westminster in the distance. Just as Big Ben struck midday, he opened the Hunter’s throttle and began three low, loud circuits of Parliament.‘I put the power on then. I thought: “Stuff it, let them hear some noise!” The funny thing was that at the time, they were discussing noise abatement.’One building annoyed him — 380-foot Millbank Tower, just upstream from Parliament. ‘I hadn’t expected Millbank Tower to be there, which was a dirty great thing. It spoiled my turns.’Alan was told later by Iain Duncan Smith’s father, Spitfire ace Wilfred Duncan Smith, that he heard Alan’s engines from on the 6th floor of the Ministry of Defence building as he talked to Sir John Grandy, chief of the Air Staff.Sir John looked up towards the sky, trying to see the plane. Duncan Smith had to put him right, telling him, ‘No, look down there!’Meanwhile, Alan was searching for Downing Street. ‘I wanted to make a noise over No. 10 as well. I didn’t have a target map so I couldn’t see where it was.’He waggled the Hunter’s wings in tribute as he passed over the RAF Memorial by Whitehall and then headed downstream towards the City. The jet flashed safely over Hungerford Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, Southwark Bridge and London Bridge.Then he was in for a surprise. ‘There, staring me in the face, was Tower Bridge. I’d forgotten it was there!‘I could have gone over it, but I was intrigued by it as a target.’He decided to fly through it, squeezing the aircraft at high speed between the busy road and the walkway over it.The cranes of the Pool of London were to his left as he took the Hunter even lower over the water, his altimeter barely registering.Peter Arnold, a steward on the cargo ship Baltic Sun, was terrified the jet would crash but ‘it straightened out and shot over our heads. I thought I was dreaming’.Alan recalls: ‘Right at the last minute, as my cockpit canopy was just below the bridge and the girders were all around me, in that microsecond I remembered I’d got a tail fin behind and I thought: “I’m going to lose the fin!” ’          RAF fighter pilot Alan Pollock flew his Hawker Hunter jet through Tower Bridge in London as a protest about the RAF\u0027s 50th anniversary (mock up) Somehow, the Hunter made it through. A cyclist on the bridge tumbled off his bike in fright, tearing his trousers. George Tapper, the Tower Bridge Watchman, was nearby. ‘There was the most thunderous roar.

Flight Lieutenant Pollock’s unofficial fly-past was over. When he landed, the first thing he did was burn his AA map. If he did end up being court-martialled, he didn’t want such an embarrassing piece of evidence being made public.Then he rang his wife’s mother. ‘There might be a bit of trouble — but not to worry,’ he told her.He was right, there was trouble — the RAF top brass was not impressed with his exploits.He was put in close arrest for two days and a psychiatrist concluded that Alan was lucid enough to face a court martial.Hundreds of letters of congratulation from RAF colleagues and members of the public arrived at Alan’s squadron, along with a barrel of beer from BOAC.An all-party motion of support, tabled in the House of Commons, was signed by six MPs (four of whom had been in the RAF).In the end, Alan was given a medical discharge instead of a court martial, possibly to deny him the chance to explain his reasons for the flypast.After leaving the RAF, he went on to work for Ford and the fire engine manufacturer Dennis.Looking back now, he has no regrets. ‘I left on a high point and I was so lucky to be flying such a magnificent aircraft as the Hunter,’ he says. ‘The RAF is the best career you can have.’And 50 years since his daring flight, he has been delighted to see that there was no need for one of his successors to stage a similar protest. ‘For the 100th anniversary, the RAF has had quite a few events going on over a number of days,’ he says. ‘Good for them!’ "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5571519/Facebook-Google-big-governed-says-Emmanuel-Macron.html","title":"Facebook and Google \u0027becoming too big to be governed\u0027 says Emmanuel Macron","story":"    Emmanuel Macron has compared Facebook and Google to oil barons after saying the tech giants were becoming \u0027too big to be governed\u0027. The French president\u0027s comments heaped even more pressure on the the Silicon Valley heavyweights in the aftermath of the privacy issues surrounding Cambridge Analytica. In an interview with Wired magazine, Macron said Facebook and Google were welcome in France, but warned they were \u0027not just too big to fail, but too big to be governed\u0027.\u0027They have a very classical issue in a monopoly situation - they are huge players,\u0027 the French leader added. \u0027At a point of time – but I think it will be a US problem, not a European problem – at a point of time, your government, your people, may say, Wake up.

I thought it might just have some superficial excitement, but it doesn’t even have that.’Some think it astonishing that such a respected painter should be so bitchy about his fellow artists.

He once compared Picasso to Walt Disney and Jackson Pollock’s splashy abstract canvases to ‘old lace’.Incredible moment teenage boys haul in a huge three-metre...Sales of ivory including almost all antiques will be...Share this articleAt other times, he said Matisse painted ‘squalid little forms’ and, of David Hockney’s paintings, ‘there’s really nothing there’.He was equally rude about some of the most acclaimed writers of the 20th century. He pooh-poohed Samuel Beckett: ‘I loathe all those ghastly dustbins on stage.’          Bacon has compared Jackson Pollock’s splashy abstract canvases to ‘old lace’ (pictured Pollock\u0027s Blue Poles) As a young man, he had been invited to lunch with Virginia Woolf. He remembered her as ‘a monster . . . she shouted all the way through lunch. She began by shouting and just carried on all the way through.’Artists who considered themselves his friends were given short shrift as soon as their backs were turned. He complained that Lucian Freud was too cautious a painter, whose best work was behind him.He also put it about that Freud ended up as a heterosexual only because his private parts were too small to be of interest to the gay community.          Bacon said that Lucian Freud (pictured) was too cautious a painter, whose best work was behind himBut Freud was able to give as good as he got. He told his friend John Richardson that Bacon’s later paintings lacked inspiration.‘What had been the subject matter of his pictures became paraphernalia,’ he said. ‘ . . . with the urgency gone, some elements just seemed to be in the way, like bits of gauze left inside a patient’s stomach by a forgetful surgeon.’Such rivalry is nothing new, even among the very greatest. When Michelangelo visited Titian in his studio in Rome in 1545, he warmly praised his latest painting to his face. But when he left, he changed his tune. It was a shame, he said, that Venetian painters like Titian had never been taught to draw.Around the same time, two sculptors, Cellini and Bandinelli, fell out over an ancient Greek statue. Cellini thought it magnificent Bandinelli thought it useless. Their patron Cosimo de’ Medici asked Cellini to explain their difference of opinion.‘Your Most Illustrious Excellency must understand that Baccio Bandinelli is thoroughly evil, and always has been,’ he said, as Bandinelli stood there in front of them. ‘So no matter what he looks at, as soon as his disagreeable eyes catch sight of it, even though it’s of superlative quality it is at once turned to absolute evil.’Cellini recalled that during this monologue, Bandinelli ‘kept twisting and turning and making the most unimaginably ugly faces — and his face was ugly enough already.’ But by now Cellini had the wind behind him, and proceeded to write off every element of a particular sculpture by Bandinelli — head, shoulders, torso, arms, legs.All in all, he concluded, it was sculpted ‘so clumsily and unskilfully that nothing worse has ever been seen’.All of which suggests that, in what Auberon Waugh used to term ‘the vituperative arts’, our own age lacks the magnificence of eras past. Compared to the great Cellini, Francis Bacon was almost sycophantic."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5572417/Mexican-woman-strangled-pregnant-girl-stole-unborn-baby.html","title":"Mexican woman \u0027strangled pregnant girl and stole her unborn baby\u0027","story":"    Jessica Gabriela, 20, was allegedly strangled and had her unborn baby ripped from her womb          Cinthia Fatima was accused of luring the young woman to her house in Tampico, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, before murdering herMs Gabriela met Fatima on social media and went to meet her after being offered some baby clothes and her family reported her missing, according to local media. Authorities were alerted to the possible link after a woman, claiming to be Fatima\u0027s sister, turned up at a hospital with a dead baby.\u0027If we all protect each other we\u0027ll get through this...Devout Mexicans whip EACH OTHER in bizarre Easter festival...Share this articleSome reports said she told doctors her sister had a recent still-birth at home, but others said she lost the baby months earlier and kept it secret. Fatima then allegedly contacted several pregnant women on social media to try to kill them and steal their unborn children.

She will face a Proceeds of Crime Hearing at a later date when it is expected she will have to pay back the cash she took.          Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester (pictured) heard the scam began in May 2012, two years after she was put in charge of accountsThe court heard the scam began in May 2012 two years after Turnbull was put in charge of accounts at the 137 pupil school where the motto is \u0027Working together we can achieve out best.\u0027Prosecuting, Alastair Reid said: \u0027During November 2016 the acting head teacher was conducting a review of the school\u0027s transactions. She became concerned with the way matters were being dealt with and asked the defendant for a meeting.\u0027But she felt she was being fobbed off without explanation and so she contacted an external investigator and they found a number of discrepancies including documents with money values tippexed out.\u0027A number of letters sent out to parents in relation to school trips had been amended. The amounts that were being asked for were lowered presumably to favour parents. A number of amounts were tippexed to cover up discrepancies.Bouncy castle boss who stole £200,000 from Christian charity...The sickest of scams: Royal Navy veteran is told his wife...Share this article\u0027A number of orders were placed for a number of gifts for the school which had been altered. The school has no knowledge of these gifts ever being received. They amounted to items such as iPad\u0027s, iPhones and other electrical items.\u0027There were a number of high value electrical items totally around £14,045. A value of £3,000 was recorded for the loss due to the amendments on the school trip letters.\u0027In 2016 an audit was carried out and she was suspended from her position. She was cautioned and interviewed by police where she made full and frank admissions in relation to these offences.\u0027She admitted making amendments in order to pocket money and she explained that she\u0027d kept the gifts and knew she shouldn\u0027t have kept them but felt under pressure by her ex-partner who has a long standing issue with class A drugs.\u0027          Turnbull, also cost the school £3,000 by using Tipp-Ex to amend letters to parents asking for money for school trips, and stole petty cash, making the total loss £19,000In mitigation defence counsel Charlotte Johnson said: \u0027This was not a sophisticated offence. She is 47 years-old and split from her husband of 19 years in 2009. She seems to have an issue with the partners she chooses.

A copy of Late Call by Angus Wilson was found in the place of the Potter book.He was found guilty of theft and two charges of handling stolen goods following a trial at Hendon Magistrates\u0027 Court last week.During a hearing at Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court on Tuesday, the defendant was given a 26-week custodial sentence for the theft, suspended for 24 months, and four week sentences for each other charge to run concurrently, also suspended for 24 months.He was ordered to pay Hatchards £1,675, and booksellers Peter Ellis and Peter Harrington, who bought the stolen goods, a total of £410 for money lost.Prosecutor Robert Simpson said: \u0027The aggravating factors, it would seem this was a fully professional, targeted operation.\u0027It is not a random theft, it is a theft of a valuable first edition book.\u0027Just hours after taking the Potter book, the defendant struck again, stealing a valuable copy of Jude The Obscure by Thomas Hardy at a pop-up store in Fortnum and Mason on the same road - an offence for which he was separately convicted earlier this year.

Schonegger was given a 26-week custodial sentence for the theft, suspended for 24 months, and four week sentences for each other charge to run concurrently, also suspended for 24 monthsChairman of the bench Paul Brooks told Schonegger: \u0027The judge found that you planned that theft, it was a relatively sophisticated theft and they were of high-value goods.\u0027The defendant was barred from visiting Hatchards for 24 months, banned from visiting Peter Harrington and told he could not go to Cecil Court in West London.He must also pay a victim surcharge and prosecution costs.The trial heard Pincher Martin was first noticed missing from the Hatchards store on the morning of New Year\u0027s Eve, while the Harry Potter book, which had been on display with a sticker stating its four-figure value, vanished by mid-afternoon.Helen Mills, the second-hand book manager at Hatchards, told the trial she was first alerted to the theft by a colleague who asked if the book had been sold shortly after 3pm.She told the court: \u0027We had a first edition of Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire on sale for £1,675, all the staff knew about it - it would have been a big thing for us to have sold it.\u0027It is rare for it to be signed by JK Rowling because she doesn\u0027t sign too many.\u0027The book has yet to be recovered.Schonegger said he had been trying to start a real estate business in the UK since 2016, but was unable to give examples of the work he had been doing and still lives at a hotel in Bayswater, west London.In mitigation, Harun Matin, defending, said: \u0027It is hard to argue that there wasn\u0027t sophisticated planning and he accepts that.\u0027He added that the defendant had \u0027learnt his lesson\u0027, saying: \u0027He is someone who has been a successful businessman in the past but he has fallen on hard times.\u0027Schonegger was arrested after booksellers who had bought his wares in the past recognised him from CCTV images circulated by Hatchards. "},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5574435/Producer-claims-powerful-people-tried-stop-movie-Chappaquiddick-scandal.html","title":"Producer claims \u0027very powerful people\u0027 tried to stop his movie about Chappaquiddick scandal","story":"    Byron Allen (second from right), the executive producer of Chappaquiddick, says ‘some very powerful people…tried to put pressure’ on him ‘not to release this movie.’ The film\u0027s stars, Jason Clarke (far left), Kate Mara (second from left) and Ed Helms (far right), are seen above Late at night on July 18, 1969, Kennedy drove his car off a bridge with Mary Jo Kopechne in the passenger seat.Kopechne, 28, who was trapped inside the car as it sank in the water, drowned while Kennedy swam to safety.Kennedy reported the accident the following day after Kopechne’s body was recovered.He denied he was drunk at the time of the crash.
