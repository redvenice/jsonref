Despite an unseasonably cold and rainy start to the day, thousands defied grey skies and flocked to newly opened cafes, barbers and beauty salons to kick off what some have described as “freedom day”. Some even queued outside department stores in the minutes before midnight to shop in-store for the first time in nearly four months. Others crowded into pubs to enjoy the day’s first freshly poured beers in a boost to the city’s hospitality and entertainment industry. Read more here from my colleagues Samantha Lock, Mostafa Rachwani and Rafqa Touma in Sydney: With queues at the pubs and beauty salons, Sydney reopens after more than 100 days in lockdown It means all over-18s need one to enter nightclubs, indoor non-seated events for more than 500 people, such as concerts or conventions, outdoor non-seated events for more than 4,000 people and any setting or event with more than 10,000 people in attendance. People will also be able to show they have had a negative lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours. But those who fake a coronavirus test result or vaccination status will be committing a criminal offence and face a fixed penalty notice. Rod Minchin reports for PA Media that Wales is facing some of the highest infection rates since the beginning of the pandemic, particularly among young people. Economy minister Vaughan Gething said: “Our fantastic vaccination programme continues to go from strength to strength but the pandemic is not over. “Cases remain high across Wales and, unfortunately, families across the country are losing loved ones to this awful virus. The clear advice from our scientific advisers is that we need to take early action now. “The Covid Pass is just one of a series of measures in place to help prevent people spreading and catching coronavirus while helping to keep the economy open. “None of us want to see further lockdowns and for businesses to have to close their doors once again. Showing a Covid Pass is already part of our collective effort to keep businesses open.”The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has lifted its advice against non-essential travel to a further 42 countries and territories, following the removal of travel advisories to 41 locations last week. PA note that just seven countries will remain on the red list from Monday: Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. People arriving from those locations will still be required to enter a quarantine hotel at a cost of £2,285 for solo travellers.New Zealand’s government would be committing “modern genocide” by reopening the country as Covid spreads among under-vaccinated indigenous people, the Māori party has said. “Māori are now presenting over half of daily cases. We need to be placed back into a level that will break the circuit of this outbreak for Māori,” co-leader of the Māori party Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said on Monday. Read the full story here: I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be giving you a rundown of the latest updates as they happen. Gyms, cafes, restaurants, pools, shops, hairdressers and beauticians can now reopen, people can have 10 people over to their home, gather in groups of 30 people outdoors in public, and travel more than 5km from their home. The new freedoms are only available to the fully vaccinated and those who have a medical exemption.

Photograph: Alan BetsonFrom rogue pork chop prices that get confused with bags of sugar to dodgy runners and the runaround at Currys PC World, our readers have been getting a hard time of late.A reader called Patricia Molony had a most peculiar experience when shopping in the SuperValu in Deansgrange, south Dublin, that she asked us to share with you. Towards the end of last month she went into the shop and bought a small basket of items.To be precise, she bought one iceberg lettuce and a bag of rocket. She also bought two lemons, two mangos, a kilo of Daily Basics granulated sugar, a bottle of organic Kombucha and a pound of Kerrygold butter. She handed over more than €47 for her shopping and off home she went. By the time she got there it had dawned on here that something was not right, so she looked at the receipt and realised that she had been charged for a single pork chop that she had not bought. Not only that but she was even more displeased that she had been charged a whopping €30 for the non-existent pork chop.So she went back to the shop within the hour and brought back what she had bought and the receipt. “I approached the girl who had looked after the sale, who immediately said, ‘Ah yeah, that was the sugar, it’s happening all the time.’” A supervisor was called, “who immediately and without question refunded my card by €30. I pointed out that one pork chop for €30 is very expensive and attempted to question what happens to the €30 if others don’t return. I was told, ‘It goes into our system.’ I asked for clarification on what system, she said ‘our system’. I was told, ‘It happens all the time, we know about it and it’s just a mix-up in the barcodes’.”Molony again asked what happens to customers who overpay money if they don’t return for a refund, and again she was told that it “goes into our system”.The following day she contacted SuperValu Deansgrange by phone and asked to speak with a manager. “I don’t recall his name, but as I began to tell him about my experience, he interrupted and said, ‘I know what you’re on about – it’s the pork chop and sugar.’ He advised me to contact Musgraves and said that they keep sending emails but are not getting anywhere, apparently, and according to SuperValu there is an issue with the barcode on the sugar.”So then Molony contacted Musgrave Group, which owns SuperValu, and was told to contact Musgrave in Cork they took her number in case “management wish to speak with me about the issue. At the time of writing I haven’t heard anything from either SuperValu or Musgraves”.She said her concern is “for anyone who buys 1kg of Daily Basics granulated sugar as part of a big shop and doesn’t realise what’s being charged and may not return, also for people who may not challenge the bill if there is a large queue behind them, or for elderly people who may not wish to question it. Surely the checkout staff should be aware as it is such a regular occurrence and ensure it doesn’t happen in the first place, and secondly, if this is a barcode issue, is it happening in all SuperValu stores across the country?”She also expresses amazement that one pork chop in SuperValu could cost €30. “I hope you can do something with this as it is wrong that each time a bag of Daily Basics sugar is bought for €30 and not refunded, it goes into ‘our system’. I’d love to know how many 30 euros they are making each day in Deansgrange SuperValu, never mind the rest of the country. I would like to see that money added up and sent to Focus Ireland or Sr Stan to feed some of the homeless. It should not be just put into the system of SuperValu Deansgrange.”We contacted SuperValu and received the following statement: “The barcode of the sugar product scanned incorrectly in a small number of instances due to a barcode printing error on the packaging. Once SuperValu was made aware of the incident it contacted the supplier and stores to immediately replace the barcode. The issue has since been rectified and any customer impacted was reimbursed.”Upset over Eir emails to deceased customerWe got an upsetting email from a reader called Philip who said he was “writing in desperation, in the hope you might be able to help me”. Last winter, his wife died at the age of just 65. “There were only the two of us – we didn’t have children. I miss Kate every day,” he says.She had set up an Eir account in her name, using his email address. “In December, I received an email from Eir, addressed to Kate and saying our account could be viewed online. I also received a bill addressed to Kate. I wrote to Eir headquarters asking for the procedure to change the account to my name. Eir did not reply and at the time the next bill was due I received an email and bill addressed to Kate.” So, our reader phoned Eir and managed to get the bill changed to his name but the notification emails addressed to Kate kept coming. “I phoned the company again and said that the emails were most upsetting. A woman to whom I spoke told me the website which sent the emails was operated by another company. Eventually, however, she told me she had managed to change the name on the emails and the next one would be addressed to me. It was still addressed to Kate. I phoned again and was told that the name had definitely been changed this time. It wasn’t.” So Philip emailed the chief executive of Eir about his problem. He received a reply from an escalations executive who told him he could sort out the problem himself by going on to “my Eir” and changing the name on the profile. “I told him I had tried this and was unable to change the name. He replied by saying that, using my details, he had changed the name on the profile and future emails would be addressed to me. The next email arrived, again addressed to Kate.”So Philip was forced to contact the escalations executive again. “He said he thought he had resolved the issue. He said he would delete Kate’s ‘my Eir’ profile and I could then set up one in my name. I asked him to let me know when he deleted the profile and he promised to do so. That was in July. He did not get back to me and I have received a further email addressed to Kate. As I am sure you will appreciate, this is most distressing and most frustrating for me. If I didn’t know better, I would think that Eir has never had a customer who died, as the company does not appear to have a system in place to address this situation.” Now, as readers will know, Eir has featured on this page on many occasions in the past but whatever about failing to live up to the expectations of customers when it comes to service and billing, adding to the upset of a recently bereaved person seems particularly shocking. We can’t help but wonder why this issue was not resolved after the first contact Philip made with the company.We made contact with Eir and it assured us the issue has now been resolved and it had made contact with our reader to explain what happened and to apologise. “Due to a technical error, agents’ updates were not recognised when the name was changed, as requested. We understand the upset this caused and we are truly sorry. The technical issue was fixed and we have made an online form available for customers to notify us in case of a bereavement on Eir.ie.” Wrong-footed on Adidas runnersA reader called Alistair bought a pair of Adidas Astrarun shoes for his daughter six weeks ago, but she only started wearing them more recently than that. In fact, she wore them for a grand total of four hours before they started to fall apart. “The sole is already separating from one shoe on one side. They still look new, yes, some marks as they have been used, but not in the area where they are separating,” he writes.Understandably he went back to the shop – one he does not identify – last weekend to return the shoes. “But the staff, after a phone call with the manager, said they can’t accept them back as they have already been worn.” When his wife asked to speak to the manager she was told they were unavailable and she was told she would have to come back at another time. Alistair contacted us to find out what his rights were. He was of the view that if the shoes were falling apart after four hours then they were “not fit for the job they were bought for”. He wondered if he should contact Adidas directly and he wanted to know would he be entitled to a refund.First off, the staff he and his wife spoke to are completely wrong and it is ridiculous to suggest that a person can’t return shoes because they have been worn. The bottom line is they are clearly faulty and Alistair has the right to redress. Under the law, he has the right to a refund, a repair or a replacement and under the law his contract is with the shop and not Adidas, and it is the shop which has to deal with his concerns.We also pointed out to him that the shop staff are not equipped in law to determine what has gone wrong with the shoes – so they can’t say they were being worn wrongly or had been ripped to pieces by dogs. They can say they will have to send them off to Adidas to be checked, though.A ‘bizarre experience’ with Currys PC WorldAmy got in touch after having what she described as a “bizarre experience” with Currys PC World.“I bought a laptop from them in March last year. I ordered it through their click-and-collect as it wasn’t available for delivery. It also wasn’t available in my local store, and it was during the 5km lockdown restriction,” her email begins. Amy has a friend who lives within 5km of Currys Dundalk so she said she’d collect it. “I ordered it with all of my details, and gave her my card to complete the purchase in-store, but I put her name down on the click-and-collect form so there wouldn’t be any issues for her to get it.” It was collected and all was well. So far so good. Time passed and Amy had to send it in for repair under warranty. She brought it back to the Swords branch. “They took my name, address and phone number, and the number of the original receipt and told me it should be repaired within two weeks and I left the laptop with them. Then I started to get text messages from them saying that a service technician would be calling to my house.”After two messages, she rang the helpline and they said they couldn’t find anything under that number or Amy’s name, then they asked was it a Toshiba TV she had left in as that was what was coming up. “The manager spoke with me, saw how annoyed I was and offered me a discount on appliances that I could claim when my laptop was back, and they said they would phone me when the laptop was in. He said this issue with the texts was something he had seen before. He was adamant he would call me when it came back in.”Another week or so later Amy actually needed an appliance so went back out, and while she was there asked about the laptop. “I didn’t have the docket with me but gave my name, address and phone number again. They asked could it be under any other name, and it occurred to me they could try my friend’s name since I had reserved it in her name, despite giving all of my own details when I left it in for repair. They had the laptop under her name. I asked when it came in, and the agent said it had come back two days earlier.”Amy asked why they hadn’t called me and was told it was because of her friend’s name. “I reiterated that all the repair documentation had my contact details on it, to which he made no response.” Amy was annoyed but decided she’d take him up on the offer of a discount. “I also had to return to the store because they neglected to give me my laptop charger when they gave back the laptop. I told them about the charger and they said it wasn’t listed as an accessory on the docket, but they rang the repair centre anyway at my insistence and the repair centre confirmed they had it and I was told I’d have to come back in that evening to collect it.”She says she has since attempted to resolve the matter with the store’s customer services team online. “They told me that for GDPR reasons they couldn’t discuss it with me as my friend is the purchaser and would need her permission to talk to me about it. I reiterated to them several times that her name was there to facilitate collection during lockdown only.”Her friend even sent them an email stating the same, and that she wanted nothing to do with the laptop at all. “They emailed her saying they needed her address to verify her identity for GDPR, even though at no stage had her address been given to them for any reason. They insisted they couldn’t proceed without her address, so she gave it to them, as she said, ‘under duress’. “They came back to me ultimately saying that I had caused the problems by putting her name on the collection, and furthermore that it is not possible for them to change the laptop into my name on their systems, and that they would not be offering me any kind of compensation or goodwill gesture for the bad customer service.” She accepts that Currys have “no legal obligations to provide a goodwill gesture based on my awful experience with them”, but believes “the GDPR issue is worrying. I’m wondering now, firstly, do they have any right to ask my friend to give her address as a means of verifying her identity when she has disclaimed any association with the laptop, and secondly, do I, having proved my rights to the laptop, not have any entitlement to have the records changed in my name?”In response to our query Currys PC World sent the following statement: “Whilst the customer service journey for this customer hasn’t been perfect, we have now investigated the data protection aspect further with the following findings. As the friend’s name has been put down on the order, then as per our records, the friend is the data subject and the one we have down on record. As such we would be remiss in our obligations under GDPR if we do not validate the identity of the friend before discussing any information about this order. This would include validating multiple bits of information depending on the sensitivity of the information being sought.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"An increasingly vigilant public and punishments might help save this crucial habitatStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine.

Just over 100,000 people are still in receipt of the payment.Ongoing checksMinister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said that checks are carried out whenever applications are submitted and on an ongoing basis.Last year, more than 70,000 reviews were conducted, including 52,000 by her department’s special investigation unit, and some 22,800 recipients were cut off.Last June, 6,000 claimants were “requested to attend offices to sign on”, the Minister said, adding that this exercise is “currently being repeated”.However, following the C\u0026ampAG’s review, the number of recipients being asked to attend in person has more than tripled to almost 20,000.The C\u0026ampAG’s review found that in a quarter of cases the claimant had not been working before the pandemic and, in a further 25 per cent of cases, they had returned to work.Ms Humphreys noted the C\u0026ampAG’s finding that some recipients would have been entitled to a different benefit if they had not received the PUP “so that the net overpayment rate was probably lower”.In a Dáil parliamentary question, Independent TD Cathal Berry asked how the money would be recouped.“If we find people who knowingly abused the PUP, we will apply the full rigours of the law against them,” Ms Humphreys replied, adding that the Garda has already acted on a number of cases.The Department of Social Protection received 1.75 million applications for the pandemic payment between March 2020 and February 2021, more than half of them within the first five weeks of the scheme being opened.The report said the scheme was launched on an “emergency basis”, and therefore officials said controls “would not be as rigorous as that normally applied”.This meant the risk of possible overpayments “would be higher than normal”, and this was “unavoidable given the high volume of claims to be processed”.The auditor’s report said that people who previously had relatively lower earnings “were significantly better off when claiming the PUP”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2022 last minute talks for 1 000 special needs assistants and 400 teachers","story":"Budget 2022: Spending on a women’s health package will quadruple to €20m.  A last-minute budget deal for 1,000 special needs assistants and more than 400 special education teachers was close to being finalised last night, with talks over the winter fuel allowance ongoing. A “significant” expansion of the Deis scheme was also in prospect, with Minister for Education Norma Foley said to have gone “hammer and tongs” with her party colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath, in talks also involving Minister of State Josepha Madigan. Amid a renewed focus on energy costs this winter, talks yesterday focused on restructuring the fuel allowance with the proceeds of climbing carbon taxes. There were concerns the payment risked being seen as too low and a desire to expand the scheme so more people could access it. The winter fuel season is not going to be extended beyond the current 28 weeks but the payment will go up, sources said.With Covid-19 pandemic spending set to tumble, the Government is finalising a budget targeting quality of life issues and access to services. The Department of Health is set to receive less than €1 billion in direct Covid-19 funding next year, down from €2 billion in Budget 2021. About half of a total Covid-19 spending package of €6.8 billion will be held back as a contingency fund. The renewed focus on medical waiting lists will see a funding package of more than €200 million mobilised to tackle backlogs. Hundreds of millions have been approved for increases in social welfare payments, energy retrofit and other projects – although fears remain over labour shortages which could endanger health, housing and climate targets.More than €200 million is set to be earmarked for retrofitting in excess of 20,000 homes, with half to be spent on 4,500 free home upgrades for low-income or energy-poverty households. The remainder will be given in grants. Some €360 million will go on active travel measures.Mr McGrath indicated yesterday he would resist a “splurge” in tomorrow’s budget, despite a “quite dramatic” turnaround leaving the exchequer deficit €7 billion lower than anticipated. Unspent funds left over from this year will be erted into measures to be announced on budget day, including a likely extension of the local authority rates waiver.A key element of Budget 2022 will be a childcare package costing €100 million next year, rising to €200 million annually once ramped up, which will seek to freeze fees for many parents and expand access to subsidies for working families and unemployed people. Income limits are likely to be raised for access to the National Childcare Scheme, while childcare hours available to unemployed people will be expanded beyond the current 20 hours a week cap. Welfare paymentsHundreds of millions will be spent on increases in core social welfare payments, with €5 added to weekly working age payments and the pension, but a €10 pension increase has been ruled out.The budget package will be supplemented by measures funded by unspent allocations from this year, including the extension of the rates waiver on a targeted basis. The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme is also set to be extended beyond its current finishing date of December 1st, but it will be reformed.As agreed in the programme for government, tax and credit bands will rise in line with inflation, with the Government aiming to improve take-home pay and enabling those who get a raise to keep 70-80 per cent of it. Spending on a women’s health package will quadruple to €20 million, while the Department of Health will be allowed to retain some of its underspend to fund more staff increases. Cigarettes are expected to go up by 50 cent per packet. A €100 million recovery package for the tourism sector is planned, focused on sustainable recovery, festivals and nightlife activities. The Department of Tourism will also target UK and US visitors with flagship events such as an American Football College game.Extra funding for more Gardaí was also expected, as with a revamped land tax planned for land zoned for homes, and more than €600 million for housing. An extension to the Help to Buy scheme was expected, as well as an increase in the Susi student grant for the first time in ten years.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"investment funds are having a laugh at ireland s housing policy desmond","story":"Businessman Dermot Desmond: “What is happening at the moment from an Ireland Inc perspective is insane.” International investment funds are “having a laugh” at the Government over its housing strategy and its social housing policy is a “shocking mismanagement of public funds”, businessman Dermot Desmond has told the Government.In private letters sent last December and February, Mr Desmond criticised Government policy on housing and the over-reliance on international institutions and the private rental sector for social housing at a time when the cost of borrowing to the State was so low.“In such a low interest environment, the current policy of buying and leasing social housing from private developers and investment funds is a criminal waste of public money,” he told Mr O’Brien in a letter dated December 15th, 2020.“The international funds are having a laugh at the Irish Government and making a lot of money in the process.”The Government was losing almost €250 million a year on an assumption that at least €5 billion of State money was being invested in new and government-led housing initiatives.In a letter to Taoiseach Micheál Martin in February, Mr Desmond criticised social housing policy, describing the Part V legislation where developers provided at the time 10 per cent but since increased to 20 per cent of any project for social housing as “one of the worst pieces of legislation ever passed and clearly not fit for purpose”.Price tags of between €600,000 and €960,000 for apartments for social housing was “by any standard a failure in policy and a criminal waste of public funds,” he said. These arrangements along with leasing from the private sector and subsidising rents to private landlords was “not good policy and it is not in line with the social housing policy in most other countries,” Mr Desmond said. He wrote that “this misguided strategy” has left housing in Ireland “prey to greedy developers and international investors”.“Allowing the private market to dictate the price of social housing is a shocking mismanagement of public funds – you might as well hand out blank cheques,” he wrote.“It is astounding that Government cannot see this and persists in pursuing what is clearly a deeply flawed national housing model to the detriment of all.”The letters were first published on Sunday by the Business Post which obtained them under the Freedom of Information Act. In a follow-up meeting between Mr Desmond and Mr O’Brien on April 1st, the businessman repeated his arguments and told the minister that the Part V legislation was “unwieldy and complicated” and that foreign investors get the benefit of guaranteed lease returns when it would be preferable if the properties belonged to local authorities.According to a minute of that meeting, Kevin Dillon, one of Mr O’Brien’s advisers, “accepted the point that the State was losing out somewhat”.He explained that this had arisen “due to the requirement for off-balance sheet accounting, the temporary lifting of which was due to Covid”.In his December 2020 letter to Mr O’Brien, Mr Desmond said that the State should be innovative in a world where the State’s National Treasury Management Agency was “almost being paid to borrow money”.“You have the opportunity to make home ownership affordable and to make money for the State,” he said. He was a strong advocate of home ownership, but “policy making is your purview, not mine,” he told the Minister. “What I do understand is finance and what is happening at the moment from an Ireland Inc perspective is insane,” he wrote.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"uk to push for significant change beyond eu proposals for ni","story":"Anti-Brexit placards in Belfast in 2018: Britain is set to ratchet up pressure on the EU this week to agree an overhaul of the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesThe United Kingdom will press the European Union for further changes to Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland this week, beyond concessions from Brussels to scrap many border controls on goods moving from Britain.The British government will call this week for “significant change” to the Northern Ireland protocol, a part of the Brexit agreement, to restore good relations between the EU and the UK.The protocol left Northern Ireland under some EU trade rules after Brexit to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Border checks on goods moving to Northern Ireland from Britain have angered unionists and led to a threat from the UK to suspend the arrangement.The EU will offer concessions, due to be announced on Wednesday, to reduce Northern Ireland’s border controls and customs checks on goods and permit British chilled meats to be sold in Northern Ireland, in a move that would reduce the possibility of a “sausage war” with the UK.Both sides are expected to clash on the UK plan to proceed with a demand that the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the EU’s highest court, be removed from its oversight role on the protocol.‘Deep imbalance’Brexit minister David Frost will say in a speech tomorrow that the role of the ECJ has “created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates” and without changes, the protocol “will never have the support it needs to survive”.Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne said the EU’s proposals would have “huge positive practical implications for businesses in Northern Ireland” whereas the issue of the ECJ was a “relatively theoretical issue” that did not affect people on the ground. “The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is there as sort of an arbitrator of last resort. It’s not something that is going to be noticed practically by people day to day in Northern Ireland at all,” he said.Tensions flared over the issue as Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Mr Frost clashed over the matter on Twitter over the weekend.In a tweet on Saturday night, Mr Coveney accused the UK of creating a “new ‘red line’ barrier to progress”, which it knows the EU cannot accept. He questioned whether London wants a “further breakdown in relations”.Mr Frost replied that he preferred “not to do negotiations by Twitter” but said the UK had set out its concerns about the ECJ in July and that “too few people seem to have listened”.

Photograph: Korean Central News AgencyKorea News Service via APNorth Korea’s state media says the country’s leader Kim Jong-un has urged officials to overcome a “grim situation” facing the country and make stronger efforts to improve the food and living conditions of his people.But no mention was made of any specific comments toward Washington and Seoul amid reports on Kim’s speech marking the 76th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party.Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling US-led sanctions against North Korea and the North’s denuclearisation steps.The country has ramped up its missile testing activity in recent weeks while making conditional peace offers to Seoul, reviving a pattern of pressuring South Korea to secure what it wants from the US.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Mr Kim, during his speech on Sunday, said his party was determined to achieve the economic goals set during the party’s congress in January, when he acknowledged his previous economic plans were not succeeding and issued new development plans for the next five years.The agency said Mr Kim confirmed the determination of the party to efficiently carry out the five-year plan to boost “the national economy and solving the people’s food, clothing and housing problems”.The KCNA said Mr Kim analysed the “unprecedented difficulties” facing the North and called for the party’s single-minded unity in developing the state economy in face of the “grim situation”.Analysts say Mr Kim is facing perhaps the toughest moment of his near decade in power.He failed to win badly needed sanctions relief in summits with then-president Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, then the coronavirus pandemic caused North Korea to close its borders and unleashed further economic shock after decades of mismanagement and sanctions over Mr Kim’s nuclear weapons programme.The World Health Organisation said last week some of its Covid-19 medical supplies had arrived at a North Korea port, an indication the North was easing one of the world’s strictest pandemic border closures to receive outside help. – APHistoric meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-unStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sydney reopens to vaccinated after more than 100 days of covid 19 lockdown","story":"Movie goers purchase food and drinks at Palace Verona Cinema following 108 days of lockdown in Sydney.

Dame Cressida said, three days after the lawsuit was filed: “As a result of what\u0027s going on, I\u0027ve asked my team to have another look at the material…no one is above the law.”The Duke of York has denied the claims and his legal team plan to fight the civil case in a New York court, unless they can get it thrown out beforehand.Prince Andrew was photographed with his arm around Ms Giuffre at Ms Maxwell’s London home. He has no memory of having ever met Ms Giuffre while sources have even suggested the photograph may be a fake. Prince Andrew is also accused of having sex with Ms Giuffre in New York and on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.Epstein hanged himself in a prison cell in August 2019 while awaiting fresh child sex abuse charges. Ms Maxwell, the daughter of the media tycoon Robert Maxwell, is in custody in a Brooklyn jail and is due to stand trial in November.Lawyers for Ms Giuffre have urged the Met Police to open a criminal inquiry. Sigrid McCawley, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, said: “Given the clear and compelling evidence implicating Prince Andrew, the politan Police should reopen its investigation and stand by their statement that no one is above the law.”Prince Andrew, 61, has seen his reputation seriously tarnished in the wake of his association with Epstein and a catastrophic interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, which led to him stepping down from official duties.In the aftermath of the interview, The Sun reported that the Duke’s siblings, the Prince of Wales, Princess Royal and Earl of Wessex, held a meeting in early 2021 in which they decided that he must not be allowed to return to public life. The trio agreed there was “no way back” to a life of official royal duties, despite Prince Andrew’s hopes of rebuilding his reputation through charity work.This weekend, the Sunday Times reported family frustrations over Prince Andrew’s behaviour, with senior members believing he is now a reputational “threat” to the firm.The Duke of Cambridge is said to be “no fan” of his uncle, with a friend singling out Andrew\u0027s “ungracious and ungrateful” attitude to his position in the Royal Family as a particular bugbear.One royal source said:  “There is no way in the world he\u0027s ever coming back. The family will never let it happen.”The Duchess of York remains his staunch supporter, with his daughters Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice remaining silent.More from NewsDitch ‘ladies and gentlemen’ and you lose valuesBritish and American citizens warned of threat to Kabul hotelsAlmost 2,000 police officers accused of sexual misconduct in four yearsFifth of critically ill Covid patients are unvaccinated pregnant womenMore than half of hospitals have no budget for children’s toysCunard ‘ruins Christmas’ for families after ruling only double jabbed can go on cruisesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"writers should never afraid exercising imaginations","story":"What colour hair has Jane Austen’s Eliza Bennet? In what way is the prettiness of Henry James’s Isabel Archer “unexpected”? As readers, we are given the briefest account of the looks of these imaginary young women. But we are left in no doubt that their creators intended to convey a powerful sense of their allure - and that they succeeded in doing so with a minimum of information about their appearance.Every fiction reader has a vivid mental image of the characters about whom they are reading. Often, that image can be as powerful as the recollection of an acquaintance or friend. Hence the peculiar sense of alienation when film or TV adaptations cast actors who fail to embody our own particular vision of the character (Keira Knightley as Lizzie Bennet? Get away!)So there is something unexpected about the novelist Sebastian Faulks’s recent account at the Cheltenham Literature Festival of how criticism of his depiction of female characters had led him to eschew description of Lena, a principal character in his latest novel, Snow Country. Instead, readers are to infer her physical presence from oblique details.But great writers have always used physical description precisely as it suits their purposes to delineate character. George Eliot’s Maggie Tulliver, tossing her hair out of her eyes with “the air of a small Shetland pony” tells us all we need to know about that steadfast young person. And on recently rereading Anna Karenina, I was surprised to find a detailed description of her appearance: black velvet dress, garland of pansies, pearl necklace and all. “Her charm,” Tolstoy writes, “lay precisely in the fact that her personality always stood out from her dress”.It is unfashionable (bordering on heresy) to say it, but the real issue is not whether novelists should stay in their lane when it comes to depicting experience, but how well they do it. Tolstoy offered a wealth of description of his heroine Austen a minimum. Both are still read with passionate engagement. Thank goodness, then, for the wisdom of Booker-prize winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo, who briskly dismissed as “nonsense” the idea that writers should not exercise the essential fictional muscle known as imagination.A recent correspondence in the Daily  Letters pages has addressed the important topic of pointless biscuits. Rich Tea biscuits, in particular, have been given a hard time for their dreary blandness.It is odd that these characterless discs should be so resolutely tenacious of their place on the supermarket shelf - someone must like them (see also Nice biscuits, those banes of my childhood teatimes). Friends in the West Country, who feed Rich Teas to the cattle in an adjacent field, assure me that they are a bovine favourite.Meanwhile, as any fule kno, Fox’s Party Rings are top biscuit.More from NewsDitch ‘ladies and gentlemen’ and you lose valuesBritish and American citizens warned of threat to Kabul hotelsAlmost 2,000 police officers accused of sexual misconduct in four yearsFifth of critically ill Covid patients are unvaccinated pregnant womenMore than half of hospitals have no budget for children’s toysCunard ‘ruins Christmas’ for families after ruling only double jabbed can go on cruisesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cunard ruins christmas families ruling double jabbed can go","story":"Families are set to miss out on cruises after Cunard said all passengers must have two Covid jabs in order to travel.The British cruise line\u0027s policy means children and teenagers from the UK are effectively banned from travelling because they are only eligible for one dose of the vaccine.It comes as rules are set to change on Monday to allow travel between the UK and long-haul destinations such as Mexico and South Africa.Forty-seven countries will be removed from the red list at 4am, meaning arrivals from those locations will no longer need to quarantine in a hotel. Meanwhile, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has lifted its advice against non-essential travel to a further 42 countries and territories.Cunard\u0027s policy previously stated that all adults over the age of 18 needed to be fully vaccinated, while children aged five to 17 who were not fully vaccinated could travel with a negative PCR result. Children under five were allowed to travel as long as their parent or  was fully vaccinated.But a fortnight ago, the policy was changed, meaning under-18s can now only travel if they are fully vaccinated with two doses. This means children from other countries, such as the US and Germany, where both shots of the vaccine are licenced for children, would be eligible to travel if they have had both jabs.Meanwhile in Britain, healthy children aged 12 to 17 are only eligible to have one dose of the vaccine – but even if they have had one jab, they would still not be eligible to board a Cunard cruise ship.One family told of their anger after they were forced to cancel their £20,000 holiday because they could no longer take their grandchildren.  Josephine Johnston, 67 and her husband Ray, 70, from Kent, were set to travel to the Canary Islands for two weeks with five relatives. Their trip on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship, which had already been postponed because of the Covid pandemic, was switched to Dec 23.

The Prime Minister travelled to Marbella with his we Carrie and their young son Wilf on Friday after attending the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester. He is understood to be staying in a luxury villa on the Costa del Sol until Thursday, where temperatures are a balmy C.But Brits back home are feeling the winter chill as millions face soaring UK energy bills, food and fuel shortages, and the impact of the cut to Universal Credit. A Westminster source told the Sunday Mirror: “It’s fine the PM taking a break, but the timing shows just how out of touch he is with ordinary Brits facing bills, bills and yet more bills.”  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was reasonable for the PM to take a break after a dficult year, where he was hospitalised with Covid- and also lost his mother. He told Times Radio: I believe he has gone away. Iaposm not sure where heaposs gone. But what I would say is I am in regular contact with him. Heaposs also had a year-and-a-half in which heaposs almost lost his le to Covid, his mother passed away very sadly two or three weeks ago and he may have decided to take a short break. I think thataposs something reasonable. Iaposm in regular WhatsApp contact with him, I spoke to him only a few days ago. Iaposm not sure when heaposs supposed to have left the country. Here are some of the issues piling up in the PMaposs in-tray while he enjoys a break. Energy costs rising and suppliers at risk of collapse Brits are facing higher energy costs this winter as soaring global gas supplies have forced smaller suppliers out of business. Gas prices have soared by % in the last  months, according to Ovo chief executive Stephen Fitzpatrick. The surge has been blamed on a number of factors, including a cold winter last year, high demand from Asia and a reduction in supplies from Russia.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted that the energy price cap - which protects consumers from sudden hikes in their bills - will remain in place this winter. Suppliers are struggling to stay afloat, with trade body Energy UK warning more could go bust in the coming months. Dermot Nolan, former chief executive of Ofgem, said it was likely that many energy firms will start going out of business. But he assured customers they would be switched to another supplier. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley warned this week that Brits should expect a signicant hike in energy costs in April when the cap on household bills is reviewed. Business Secretary canapost rule out energy outages this winter Mr Kwarteng was unable to guarantee there will be no interruptions to gas supply this winter but insisted he was as certain as I could be it would continue. He told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips On Sunday: Iaposm very committed and convinced that we will have full energy supply. Iaposm as certain as I could be. Because obviously this is a global issue, weaposve seen right across the world real supply chain pressures, youaposve seen the Chinese have power blackouts, theyaposre rationing supply, here in the UK our job is to make sure there is minimal disruption.  Mr Kwarteng said it wasnapost his job to advise people to wrap up warmer when askedBrits should put on another woolly jumper. Itaposs up to people - itaposs amazing how dferent peopleaposs cold thresholds can be very dferent, he said. Some people feel comfortable wrapped up in lots of dferent clothes, others wear relatively little - I think people should be sensible. I think people should do what they feel comfortable with.Factories aposdaysapos from shutdown over gas pricesIndustry leaders have warned that factories are just “days away” from having to stop production due to the escalating energy costs. David Dalton, of the British Glass Manufacturers’ Association, said some companies were “days” from having to close temporarily, according to the Sunday Times.Mr Kwarteng dashed hopes from struggling manufacturers and energy firms of more support but said he is working closely with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help industry.However, a senior Treasury source insisted that no such talks have taken place. The Government was forced to step in when US fertiliser giant CF Industries temporarily stopped production in its British plants last month due to the hike in gas prices. The firm produces carbon dioxide as a by-product - triggering shortages of CO which is widely used in the food sector to keep products fresh.  Universal Credit cuts begin to bite - as peers aim to force showdown Millions of people are being hit by cuts to Universal Credit as the Tories refused to drop their plans to ditch the £-a-week increase. The temporary uplt was introduced at the start of the pandemic, amounting to around £,-a-year. Tory peer Baroness Stroud has vowed to stage a vote in the Lords over the cruel cut. She recently told the BBC: At this moment in time, MPs have not voted on this at all, itaposs been a decision taken by the Executive, so my intention is to bring a vote in the Lords, cross-party vote that would say to the House of Commons, ‘Think again on this issue. Is this something we really want to do as a civilised nation, putting our poorest people into poverty is surely not the way forward as we come out of the pandemic ’ Shoppers face empty shelves and told to aposget used to higher food pricesapos One in six adults in Britain have been unable to buy essential food items in the last fortnight, according to the Office for National Statistics . Some % of adults said they had not been able to purchase vital goods as they were not available, while % said the same for non-essential food items. Downing Street has drafted in former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis to solve the supply chain crisis. He will identy current blockages and pre-empting potential future issues. Miguel Patricio, boss of Kraft Heinz which makes baked beans and ketchup, said inflation and the lack of truck drivers in the UK was driving up prices. We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world, he told the BBC. Army drafted in to drive fuel tankers Motorists have struggled to get fuel in recent weeks due to shortages of drivers to get petrol to the pumps. Army tanker drivers have had to be deployed to help fill petrol stations hit by fuel shortages. Ministers have insisted there is no dearth of fuel but acute driver shortages created widespread issues.  The Government is expanding a fast-track scheme to train up to , HGV drivers to ease the crisis. But the , additional places on -week courses will not begin until next month, meaning it is unlikely to solve issues this Christmas.

The Government has announced that people who want to give blood will be able to do so more easily from the end of . Currently, prospective donors are askedthey have recently had sex with a partner who may ever have been sexually active in an area where HIV is endemic, which includes most of sub-Saharan Africa. If they have, the donor will be deferred for three months after the last sexual contact with that partner. But this can mean Black African donors and other potential donors in long-term relationships have been unable to donate blood, the Department of Health said.  It is hoped that, by removing the question, inclusivity and equity for donors will be improved - without compromising safety. This change will also provide more opportunities for people to donate for the ongoing need for rarer blood types - helping to save UK lives, a government statement added.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: This will make it easier for black donors in particular to donate blood, ultimately saving lives. We are creating a fairer system for blood donation. And, as we recover from this pandemic, we are committed to levelling up society, which includes improving access to services for everyone. Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: We are delighted that the Secretary of State has confirmed this outdated, unnecessary and actively discriminatory question will be removed from blood donor screening forms. The science is clear that this is unnecessary and does nothing to improve safety.Instead, it actively prevents much-needed donors coming forward to give blood, particularly from black communities. Other questions will remain on the donor form to ensure inidual, high risk behaviours are picked up and those donors are deferred. It is estimated that the risk of an HIV infectious donation not being detected corresponds to one in  million. The change follows recommendations from a collaboration of experts in the UK blood services and LGBT+ charities. The group looked at the implications of the question and concluded it could safely be removed.

Advice for a further  locations, including Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand, will also be eased.  The move will make it easier for Britons to obtain travel insurance to visit the destinations.  Most policies are invalidthe Government has advised against all but essential travel to a country. It follows the removal of travel advisories to  countries earlier this week and is part of a new policy to stop advising Britons to avoid all but essential travel to non-red list countries on Covid- grounds except in exceptional circumstances, such aslocal health systems are overwhelmed. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: These updates make travel abroad easier - boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families. I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe.” In a further boost to the beleaguered travel and aviation industries, which have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, an overhaul to rules around coronavirus tests travellers have to take when ing to the UK from abroad will be in place by the end of the month. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the deadline, which was announced when a previous overhaul of the travel regime aa unveiled, and said he wanted cheaper lateral flow devices to replace expensive polymerase chain reactiontests by half-term. The Cabinet Minister claimed travellers ing to the UK could be done and dusted with organising testing before they even get home, with lateral flow tests available at airports. He vowed the switch from PCR testing to lateral flows would be ready for families to have a foreign holiday this month. Askedhe was referring to English schoolsapos half-term breaks, he told Times Radio: Yes, thataposs right, October . “Thataposs the goal, and, as I say, the testing companies are gearing up to do that. “Iaposve spoken to the airports including Heathrow and they even have tests available as you walk through the airport, so you could be done and dusted before you even get home with these things, which will be a massive improvement to having to send off PCR tests to labs and waiting for the results and all the costs involved. It is understood the lateral flow tests would not be free but would be a far cheaper alternative to PCR tests, where costs have sometimes reached hundreds of pounds. A family of four faced having to fork out about £ for PCR tests.

The Government said it was only a temporary measure, because you can’t expect the poor to eat permanently. Minister Nadine Dorries helpfully explained: “What we’re doing is giving people a step out.” It’s always a sign of generosity, to help the poor step out by taking money off them. That’s why you see so many people lying in shop doorways, shouting “can you take a few coins off me please, mate. I’ve got nearly two quid to last me the week, please take it away so I can step out”. It’s the same when a crackhead robs  quid from a pensioner. The robbers are simply helping them not to rely on their pension, and to step out to towards self-reliance by having to eat cat food for the week.  The cut seems especially generous because the other financial news is that the wealthiest people in the world are hiding £.trillion in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, where they dodge the rules to avoid paying tax. So there’s an obvious way to make the world fair. The poorest people in Britain must be allowed to set up a benefits haven. Anyone should be allowed to claim as many benefits as they like, as long as all the money is sent to the Isle of Wight, where the rules are relaxed. So you can receive unemployment benefit while doing a window cleaning round, as long as the windows are registered in Ventnor.  Cleaners will be able to claim Universal Credit without mentioning their earnings on the application,their bucket and sponges have a residence in a cupboard on the ferry from Portsmouth. Campaigners will protest against this obvious theft, but the Government can say they can’t be too hard on benefit cheats or they’ll move abroad and fiddle a dferent country, which will be a huge loss to our economy. You’ll be able to claim disability benefit, saying that you can’t move because your neck is broken in  places eventhere’s nothing wrong with it, as long as the neck is registered on Shanklin pier. Specialist accountants will find loopholes in the law that state this is perfectly legal providing the neck is in the Isle of Wight for  days a year. So claimants will have to visit each year, and the island will be transformed into a giant playground for benefit cheats. A massive harbour will be built in Sandown, where benefit cheats will spend their summer relaxing on the decks of their pedalos and sipping lager before flaunting their wealth in the amusement arcades. Sometimes it will be reported that a woman from St Helens has claimed for  babies that don’t exist, but her financial advisor will reply that they were all registered as living in the theme park at Blackgang Chine, so no law has been broken. She’ll donate £million to a party that supports benefit cheats, and the world will be fair at last.

This is a shame, because this time it’s about comedy and Manchester, and I wanted to start with a Ken Goodwin gag. It’s a great joke – about a horse that collapses in Piccadilly – but I listen to feedback and jokes from the s are strictly off-limits from now on. It is a shame. I don’t knowyou remember Mr Goodwin, who died in , but he was a staple on The Comedians back in the day. Famous for his nervous, stuttering style, but a really good, gentle comedian. “It’s all in the character, the way I tell the jokes,” he once said, “I’m just Simple Simon. I come over all nervous and shy, and most of the audience is laughing at me before I’ve said a word.” Which is ideal for a comedy turn – but not what you look for in a Prime Minister.  I don’t knowyou watched Mr Johnson last week as he took to the stage in Manchester to deliver his ­set-piece conference performance. Probably you didn’t. I, once again, had to. There were, to be fair to whoever wrote it, some decent jokes. More than some, in fact. They kept coming. At that point the horror of it dawned on me – this speech was all jokes. No policy, no reference to social care, no mention of the brutal universal credit cut his Government had just enacted. Just a -minute act that could have been done at a golf club, or a corporate retreat, or the wedding of someone you don’t like. Meantime, a day later and a couple of miles across town, the current Leader of the Opposition, Marcus Rashford, gave a speech of his own as he proudly received an honorary degree from Manchester Uni.  He said: “Yesterday, millions of families across the UK lost a leline and a means of staying afloat – a move that could see child poverty rise to one in three children. For that reason, today is bittersweet.” There’s not really any competition any more, is there  The nature of this PM is beginning to come to the fore. He was never built for crisis. He is a good-time type of guy, and this has not been a good time. It’s going to get tougher, too. It’s not one of those things you can laugh your way through. Whether it dawns on the wider ­country or not, I’m not sure. He is still odds-on to win the next election but those odds are getting longer with every empty shelf, every Covid death, every cancelled rail project, every flash of Russian money. Christmas, let me tell you, had better be good. Otherwise, Mr Johnson is going to have to rely on this increasingly tired act to get him through. The misconception is that he’s the type of guy you’d like to have a pint with. Let me tell you: he’s not. To be fair to him, very few politicians are the type of guy you would like to have a pint with. Ken Goodwin, on the other hand, would have been a joy: “I got on the bus in Manchester the other day and I said to the conductor, ‘Do you stop at the Imperial ’ He said, ‘What – on my money ’” Beautul. Last mention of Ken, I promise. But they don’t write them like that any more.

The travel aposred listapos will be slashed from  countries to just seven from am in a boost to families hoping to take half-term breaks abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the long-awaited update to the system last week - with South Africa and Thailand also removed from the list. Indonesia has also been taken off the red list opening up tourist destination islands like Bali. It means Brits ing from those countries will no longer have to have to isolate in a hotel for  nights at a cost of £,.  And those countriesapos residents and nationals will finally be allowed to visit the UK again after months of a total ban. The only seven countries that now remain on the red list are Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Venezuela. It comes after the Foreign Office lting its advice against non-essential travel to a further  countries and territories due to the coronavirus pandemic. This makes it easier for people to obtain travel insurance for trips to those destinations. There are now also two sets of rules for people coming from the rest of the world to the UK depending on their vaccination status. Children and fully-vaccinated adults arriving from the rest of the world now only have to take one test - a ‘Day ’ PCR test after landing. There’s no need to isolate, and no need to take a “pre-departure” test before flying. The Day  test will also be replaced with a cheaper lateral flow later this month, of which passengers will simply able to send a photo to the authorities. But the plan to replace day  PCR Covid tests with cheaper lateral flow tests for the fully jabbed is causing rts in the Cabinet and has yet to be given a launch date. The Department for Transport has said the new testing rules will come in by the end of October which may be too late for thousands of families planning a half-term break overseas. They would be forced to shell out more cash on expensive PCR tests.The Foreign Office has also axed advice against non-essential travel to a further  countries and territories due to the coronavirus pandemic, making it easier for people to obtain travel insurance for trips to those destinations.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Friday: These updates make travel abroad easier - boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Recent studies suggest that about % of us donapost actually understand that. On average, over the last five years, about , people have died with flu-related conditions. This year will be the first time flu in any real numbers and Covid will be around at the same time, she said. She added: So the risks of catching both together still remain. Andyou do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having Covid alone. So I think itaposs an uncertain winter ahead - thataposs not a prediction, itaposs an uncertain feature - but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain.  Explaining that this yearaposs flu could be made up of dferent strains, she said the vaccine being offered this winter season is to protect against four of those. She said: Weaposve got a pretty good array in our toolbox to try and hit whichever one becomes dominant but it could be more than one this year, and peopleaposs immunity will be lower. So I think the real trick here is to get vaccinated - in both Covid and flu - but obviously to continue to do those good hygiene behaviours that weaposve been practising all through Covid. The average flu season sees around , deaths a year.  Dr Harries insisted it is not the case that  deaths a day is seen as an acceptable death rate for Covid, and said officials are still taking it extremely seriously. She told The Andrew Marr show: We are starting to move to a situation where, perhaps Covid is not the most signicant element and many of those iniduals affected will of course have other comorbidities which will make them vulnerable to serious illness for other reasons as well. She said the extremely good vaccine uptake is now preventing very signicant amounts of hospitalisation and death, but added that this is now one of the most dficult times to predict what will come with coronavirus. She said: We have dferent levels of vaccination, we have a little bit of immunity waning in older iniduals, which is why weaposre now starting to put in a Covid booster vaccine. We have slightly dferent effectiveness in dferent vaccinations that have been provided. On a positive note, she said it appears the global dominance of the Delta iant has seen other coronavirus iants become extinct, but she added that we still need to stay alert because it is still very early days of a new virus.

And a nearly empty fresh fruit and veg section was also seen in an Asda store in Cardf, where some of the freezer and fridge sections were completely empty. The news comes as millions of Brits have been unable to buy essential food in the past fortnight, with one in three already having started stockpiling for Christmas.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror This has led to calls for Britainaposs supermarkets to ditch their traditional rivalries in a bid to boost the beleaguered supply chain this Christmas and prevent almost one in three lorries on the road being completely empty. Rival retail chains have been told that they need to collaborate in the run-up to the festive season as the shortage of haulage drivers continues to threaten stock deliveries across the country. Trade magazine The Grocer reported that supermarkets have been urged to avoid a survival of the fittest Christmas this year to prevent further stresses piling onto an already creaking logistics network. The call comes as statistics from the Department for Transport show that poor utilisation of distribution capacity sees around  per cent of lorries on the road completely empty while those that contain goods are on average only  per cent full.  The Grocer said that the UKaposs ongoing driver shortage has created stf competition among supermarkets for limited haulage availability, with each retailer intent on minimising their own disruption. But as demand builds in the run-up to Christmas they have been urged to show greater collaboration to ease the burden on supply chains. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, told the magazine: The biggest choice every one of the major supermarkets has got this week is: are we going to have a survival of the fittest Christmas or are we going to all work together and try and get through Christmas. The problem with crisis is everyone fights to protect their own. So what you are finding is businesses fighting to protect the certainty of their own deliveries and that pushes against collaboration and co-ordination of efficiencies.  Tesco said this week that it was increasing its use of rail freight by almost per cent to help keep its shelves stocked during the driver crisis. It has also been reported that bus drivers are quitting to take up better-paid work as lorry drivers, leaving some key routes understaffed or axed entirely from the timetable, as operators point the finger at road haulage bosses for poaching their drivers in recent months. Britainaposs supply chains were brought to a standstill by the exodus of European truckers, leading to fuel shortages and empty shelves in supermarkets, as a result of the Boris Johnsonaposs governmentaposs disastrous Brexit plan.  Ministers stepped up their drive to avoid further lorry driver shortages by moving to create an additional , fast-track driver courses and almost a million letters have gone out asking HGV licence-holders who have left the industry, including bus drivers, to .At the same time, Boris Johnson has jetted off for a sunshine break in Spain, travelling to Marbella with his we Carrie and their young son Wilf on Friday after attending the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester.

Locals have long claimed that the Caynton Caves were used by the Knights Templar in the th century. Historic England described the cave as a grotto and believe it was built in the th century - a few hundred years after the Templar order was disbanded.

Even though the cave has been linked to the medical military group, it is likely to be a Victorian folly. Brendan said: There were some photos online, but nothing of signicance. But when I went down there it opened my eyes. It was expansive. Someone had been down there and put in the effort to make such beautul carvings.  It must have looked pristine when it was first done. The cave is covered with graffiti and Brendan also found a picture of a man in a ritual room. He also discovered a semi-collapsed wall - which sparked concerns over the safety of the structure. He said: I didnapost think I was claustrophobic, but I was thankful to get out. Brendan left the cave after about half an hour of exploring because he said he started to feel a little dazed.

Miguel Patricio said the firm is raising prices, where necessary, around the world of products including ketchup and baked beans. Mr Patricio said this was because of a lack of truck drivers in the UK and labour shortages and an increase in logistics costs in the US. He told the BBC consumers will need to get used to paying more for food due to the worldaposs rising population and a lack of land to grow produce. But he also said firms would have to take on the cost rises, adding: I think itaposs up to us and to the industry and to the other companies to try to minimise these price increases.  Speaking about the reason behind the increases, Mr Patricio said: Specically in the UK, with the lack of truck drivers. InUS, logistic costs also increased substantially, and thereaposs a shortage of labour in certain areas of the economy. It is also because inflation was across the board unlike in previous years, he said.Kona Haque, head of research at the agricultural commodities firm EDF Man, told the broadcaster: Whether itaposs corn, sugar, coffee, soybeans, palm oil, you name it, all of these basic food commodities have been rising.It comes amid fears over supply chain issues ahead of Christmas.  Business advisory firm BDO LLP said its research suggested that economic growth had slowed for five months in a row due to disruption.PM Boris Johnson has refused to rule out shortages at Christmas while Chancellor Rishi Sunak said distribution problems with some key goods could continue for months.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said any shortages at supermarkets would not be the fault of No or the Government.

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.  The second world championship will take place in December this year, again virtually, and I hope to have even more people taking part. It’s amazing to be a part of people experiencing something new and fun, it doesn’t feel like work! Hannah’s story is a great example of how le can get better when you try something new, soyou already love Popcorn chicken - tasty pops of  per cent chicken breast, perfect to nibble on by themselves or as a side - then itaposs time to turn up the heat. Popcorn Chicken Zinger is the same delicious chicken and moreish crunch, but KFC have pumped up the spice for those who can handle a kick.

My partner and I both turn the big - this year, and we’re treating ourselves with a holiday of a letime to Mexico. We will certainly be enjoying a margarita or two on The Health Lottery.” And itaposs not just the winners that benefit, as money raised through The Health Lottery helps fund vital local community projects. £ million has been raised so far, for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.This is one of the reasons Sarah plays The Health Lottery online. “I have been playing The Health Lottery once a week since , picking two lines,” she explains.My nan had Alzheimer’s, so it is really important for me to support these projects. They are empowering the most vulnerable communities and tackling health inequalities around Great Britain. It is fantastic that I can give back a little to these wonderful projects by simply buying a ticket.” I asked my we to check all the numbers! For Nuneaton Rugby Club player, Allan Taylor, finding out heaposd scooped £, in last yearaposs New Year’s Day draw was a great way to kick of .  “You never think it is going to be you,” said father-of-three Allan, . “I couldn’t believe it was true! I asked my we and girls to all check my numbers. We wanted to make sure it was the real deal before we could properly celebrate! They were ecstatic about the news. It has allowed us to get that long weekend in Dublin that we have always wanted. I really fancy going on the Guinness factory tour and learning a little more about my favourite stout.” One of the reasons Allan plays is because it allows him to give something back. Playing The Health Lottery supports so many great causes. We are a family that has received some great support over the years from local causes. It is wonderful that we can give back to these grassroots projects simply by buying a Health Lottery ticket.” The size of the prize hasnapost sunk in yet! When Sue from Chesterfield got a phone call from The Health Lottery asking her to check her online Health Lottery account - something Sue hadn’t done in a while - what she saw changed her le. She had won £, in a second chance draw. “To be honest, I’ve been thinking about what I need,” said Sue, when asked what sheaposll spend the money on. I barely spend money on myself normally so this is a chance to fix up some things that need done. The garden. The house. Things like that. The size of the prize hasn’t sunk in yet so who knows what will be left. Maybe enough for a car  A holiday  It’s exciting to think about.” The former community worker says that playing The Health Lottery is a continuation of her work to support others. She said: “I’ve always been keen on helping people. I’ve been brought up that way. So I’d happily spend £ on a Health Lottery ticket because I know that it genuinely helps people. I’ve seen some of the good causes that are supported. Obviously I play the lottery for the prizes, as we all do, but the sense of supporting your community really sweetens the win.” It’s been a great moment to share In August , the News UK finance team syndicate scooped a fantastic £, after matching  balls, plus the bonus ball. Formed of eight players, the Peterborough-based team have been playing The Health Lottery for three years now – and were delighted to bag their first big win.  Syndicate leader Gary Smithdale said: “When I answered the call, the news came as a great surprise – I couldn’t wait to tell everyone! Some of us have worked together for over  years, so it’s been a great moment to share.” Their big win even inspired a new team name. “What about Sunshine  ” mused team member Margaret Lenton. “The sun’s shining on this lucky day, and there’s eight of us!”It is very important to support the local charities that benefit from Health Lottery salesKathy Brown, a Buckinghamshire Council Business Support Officer from Aylesbury, was delighted when she found out she had won £, in The Health Lottery’s draw online. Amazingly, this is the second time she has won a tidy sum by playing The Health Lottery, although her recent winnings dwarf the £ won previously. Big hearted Kathy says a big reason she plays is to support local causes and community projects: “In this day and age I think it is very important to support The Health Lottery and all the charities that are supported.”  While she plans on enjoying spending much of her winnings herself, she said she will make sure her daughters benefit too, selflessly spreading the joy to her family.

In an interview in  she attacked him for his high-stakes lestyle after their orce. But that was all forgotten about when Rangers-daft Mickey announced to Facebook pals that he’d married Sandra – who has added Carroll to her name. A friend said: “Mickey’s calmed down a lot and has been living quite a nice wee le and working hard. Him and Sandra buried the hatchet and got back together and it has all worked out well for them. “It happened very quickly in the last few months but they fell right back in love and are really happy together now. What’s in the past has been forgotten about.” Mickey ended up penniless and ­homeless after his hedonistic partying days on the beaches of Jamaica, Barbados and Puerto Banus. He was frequently pictured sporting Ibrox club-branded jewellery and sportswear, and was labelled as “Rangers-Daft Lotto Lout” and “King of Chavs” for racking up anti-social behaviour convictions and jail time.  Mickey was only  and working as a binman in Norfolk when he spent his last pound on his first-ever lottery ticket. He’d said: “It didn’t go wrong – it was the best  years of my le for £. I don’t look back with any regrets, that’s for sure. “I reckon I’m lucky to be alive. If I still had the money I’d probably be ft under.” In  it was revealed how he had a job delivering coal and logs in Moray for £-a-week after moving to Scotland for a fresh start. He rented a flat in Elgin where he worked in number of jobs including in a slaughterhouse and biscuit factory.  The pair, who orced in , have a teenage daughter, and had just become engaged when he hit the jackpot in November . Sandra, now , said in : “Mickey thought he was a big shot, better than everyone because he had money, and he surrounded himself with hangers-on. “I left because he was frittering away £million on drink and drug binges and was cheating on me with prostitutes.” Comment MORE ON LotteryProstitutionHomelessness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

German authorities identied Christian Brueckner as a prime suspect in Maddieaposs case last year and said they had concrete evidence the missing girl was dead. Investigators are now said to be  per cent convinced the convicted sex offender is the man responsible. But the -year-old has taunted German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who claims to have enough evidence to charge the rapist, saying he is bluffing.Sources close to Brueckner told The Sun Online : B and his legal team remain sure Wolters and his investigators don’t have a shred of evidence to convict him on or charge him over.  Their position has always been clear:there is evidence, show it. But the police never have. That’s why they are convinced these comments are a bluff designed to get B to crack behind bars and confess to someone. That will never happen. B believes Wolters is simply a celebrity cop looking to make headlines.” Brueckner is currently serving a seven-year sentence for raping an American tourist in Portugal in  and the prosecution team are taking time to gather as much evidence as possible before bringing allegations to court. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, Mr Wolters said: “It is now possible that we could charge. We have that evidence now. “But it’s not just about charging him – we want to charge him with the best body of evidence possible. “When we still have questions, it would be nonsense to charge rather than wait for the answers that could strengthen our position.  “That’s why we said we’ll investigate as long as there are leads or information for us to pursue. I’m not saying that what we have is insufficient now. But he’s in prison, so we don’t have this pressure on us. We have time on our hands.” Part of the evidence being looked into by police includes an alleged confession made Brueckner made to a friend.  They are also investigating phone data that shows he was at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared in . Madeleine vanished from her family’s holiday flat at the resort in Portugal days before her fourth birthday. Kate and Gerry from Rothley, Leicestershire, have said they “hang on to the hope, however small, that we will see Madeleine again”.  Last year, German cops told the McCanns last year that they had “evidence” Madeleine was no longer alive. However prosecutors now admit they have no proof she is dead. In the UK police are still treating her disappearance as a missing person case. A McCann family source told The Sun Online that Madeleineaposs parents have said they believe Brueckner will keep trying to evade justice and they fear they may never know who snatched their daughter.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Christian BMadeleine MccannPoliceCrimeMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Crook had hit speeds between mph and mph during sections of road that had a speed limit of mph.  She then crossed onto the wrong side of the road before turning onto oncoming traffic - where she passed the HGV. Chris Hopkins, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court of the detailed accounts of witnesses who saw Crook in the build-up to the crash in October . Mr Hopkins said one driver told police: Suddenly he became aware of the defendantaposs car... to his disbelief she was level with him but on the other side of the crash barrier... he watched in horror as the defendant crossed the two eastbound lanes and entered the exit slip on the M.  According to another witness, earlier on in her journey: He could see her hands on the steering wheel while she was looking forward and appeared to be driving in a determined manner. One of the drivers she approached on the M recalled: The defendant appeared to pick a lane and stick with it. There was no braking. The defendant drove straight and with purpose. The court heard the vehicle in front of Paula swerved to avoid Crook, leaving the much-loved former teacher no time to react.  Mr Hopkins said Crookaposs intentions remained unclear, but added: All of the evidence indicates this was a deliberate act and the only sensible conclusion that can be drawn is that the defendant was trying to harm herself. Paula and Crook both had to be cut out of their vehicles and taken to Aintree Hospital. Crook spent time in a critical condition. The mum-of-two told police she had no recollection of the incident and suggested she had taken a wrong turn and panicked. Mr Hopkins said: The fact that that explanation is maintained by the defendant is something which has caused great distress to family members of the victim. A letter written to Judge Garrett Byrne by Crook ended with her claiming she had no explanation for her actions. Highlighting the evidence that Crook made no attempt to avoid a crash, he concluded it was not a case of taking a wrong turn and then panicking, it was a deliberate course of conduct. The judge added that,it had been Crookaposs intention to harm herself, it was a profoundly selfish one because you were prepared to injure or kill others in achieving that goal. Crook admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to four years and eight months. She was disqualied from driving for three years after her release.

Tracy Williams went for a check-up when she started to slur her words and began struggling to stay upright. After checks, the -year-old received the devastating news that she has Motor Neurone Disease , Liverpool Echo reported. The doctors told the Formby, Merseyside, mum that she has between three and  years to live. MND is a rare condition that affects the brain and the nervous system. Thereaposs no cure for the disease and it can signicantly shorten le expectancy, but some people live with it for many years.  Tracyaposs best friend Nikki Stewart is now on a mission to help her walk down the aisle on her wedding day before her mobility gets any worse. Tracy said: At first it was my foot, it was like it was catching on the floor and then my walking gradually got worse. I got weakness in my legs on my left side and then it started in my arm. I went to the doctors and they sent me to the neurologist for brain scans and spinal scans and things. Tracy has a history of MS in her family and initially suspected that could be the cause of her symptoms, but doctors soon ruled it out.  After undergoing tests at the Walton Centre, she was diagnosed with MND on September . Tracy said: I was heartbroken because they told me I could have three to  years to live and that was the worst shock more than anything. They told me Iaposll end up in a wheelchair and my speech will go completely and Iaposll have trouble eating. Tracy, who has five children aged , , ,  and , is determined to keep on working in her job as an office manager at a school. She is aiming to get married at the start of next year to her partner of  years, Andy Ball, , and fulfil her dream of walking down the aisle. In order to help Tracy to achieve her dream and give her and Andy a special day to remember, friend Nikki has set up a Go Fund Me page. Sheaposs my best friend - we work together, Nikki said. I lost my husband to Covid in January and she was there for me. I know what my children went through and I canapost imagine what her boys will go through. Thataposs why I want to do something special for her really.

The elderly sister was walking in Hull on November ,  at roughly .pm when she was floored and had her bag snatched by Matthew Goodwillie, , and teenager Adam Fenton, now . The dazed victim could not remember how many people had been on the moped and only noticed that her handbag had been stolen when she was helped to her feet by a shocked bystander.A teenager riding on the back of the vehicle was identied at the time as Fenton, and officers arresting him also found a signicant amount of cannabis at his home address.Fenton then led officers to the moped driver, Goodwillie who would have avoided charges had it not been for the signicant assistance of Fenton.  For his part in the robbery and for possession with intent to supply Fenton was given a -month suspended sentence and a community order of  hours unpaid work.Goodwillie, of Hull, was identied as the leader in the abhorrent crime and received five years and  months imprisonmentfor his part in the robbery and for possession of a bladed weapon in September this year.CCTV, shown to Judge John Thackray, showed a moped passing the nun before turning around, mounting the pavement and knocking her to the ground.The contents of the handbag was mainly personal items including keys with addresses written on tags, a silver medal on a string and a bottle of holy water. All of these were ed when the bag was later found discarded. Fenton was identied as the rider of the moped seen on CCTV and upon his arrest,  bags of cannabis with a street value of around £ were found at his address alongside drugs paraphernalia. There was evidence on mobile phones also found at the address that Fenton was facing signicant pressure from people who claimed he owed them money, sent as messages on the day of the robbery.Prosecutor Ms Jessica Strange described the delays the case had faced due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Ms Strange told the court that after pleading guilty to both the charge of robbery and possession with intent to supply, Fenton had already indicated that he was willing to assist police in locating the driver of the moped. Goodwillie had a number of previous convictions ranging from drug offences to battery and criminal damage. Defence barrister Steven Garth told the court that Goodwillie had suffered a wretched upbringing and said he had been on medication for unconfirmed schizophrenia and paranoia for a number of years. Mr Garth also confirmed that Goodwillie had experienced problems with Class A drug addiction since the age of just . Describing the robbery, Mr Garth said: It was a wicked act on his part and a terrible ordeal for the elderly victim. Judge Thackray agreed, telling Goodwillie: Your carefully chosen victim was an -year-old lady walking on her own at night, among the most vulnerable people in our society. You drove into her on a moped and rammed her to the ground, such an action could have caused serious injurynot a fatality. I have not the first trouble in identying you as the lead in this enterprise being the older man at the time of the offence and exerting considerable influence on you co-defendant. Goodwillie was sentenced to  months imprisonment for his part in the robbery and a further eight months for possession of a bladed weapon in a public place which occurred in September this year, meaning a total sentence of five years and  months. Judge Thackray recognised that without Fentonaposs help, Goodwillie would have escaped justice and that the information had been given at great personal risk with Fenton confirming he had received indirect personal threats. When passing his sentence, Judge Thackray told Fenton: You should consider yourself extremely lucky. Fenton was given a -month suspended sentence for his part in the robbery with a community order of  hours unpaid work and  days on a rehabilitation course.

A meeting was held last January where Charles, Anne and Edward were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le, an insider has claimed. The source said: “Nine months ago Charles, Anne and Edward had a meeting, a summit, and agreed there was no way back for him.” It comes as the scandal hit Duke of York is also deemed to be a threat for the Royal Family by William who allegedly thinks he is “ungracious and ungrateful,” said a Sunday Times source. Andrew, , is facing a sex abuse lawsuit in the United States and stepped back from public le after a disastrous interview for him on the BBC’s Newsnight nearly two years ago.  The bad publicity that the saga has given the royals means that he will never be allowed back it is claimed by the Sunday Times insider. They said: “There is no way in the world he’s ever coming back, the family will never let it happen.” The source also claimed that William is annoyed about Andrew’s attitude since the scandal has emerged, saying it’s what “really gets” to him. They continued: “Any suggestion there isn’t gratitude for the institution, anything that could lead the public to think that senior members of the family aren’t grateful for their position,is really dangerous.”While Andrew’s image has been tarnished, it does appear that he feels he can put the scandal behind him especially with the way he took a leading role at the funeral of Prince Philip this year in speaking to the media. He talked to television crews outside All Saints Chapel, Windsor Lodge, two days after the Duke of Edinburgh died to express the feelings of the Royal Family. A friend of Charles told The Sunday Times that Andrew seized the opportunity “to be in front of a camera and was making it clear to the households that he was going to be in front of a camera ASAP.” But a Sunday Times source said that while Charles “loves” his brother he feels that the sex abuse writ served by his accuser Virginia Giuffre is causing “unwelcome reputational damage to the institution”. Adding: “a way back for the Duke is not possible, because the spectre of this accusation raises its head with hideous regularity”. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. Kensington Palace was contacted for comment.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Prince Charles is definitely recognised around the world as a deep thinker on these issues, and having a track record of having been interested in this for a long, long time. So itaposs not just the symbolism – they are people of substance on these issues.  Mr Ward added that he thought the aposstrong showingapos from the royal family was aposentirely helpfulapos as it showed the UK was serious about climate change. Gareth Redmond-King, of the UKaposs not-for-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the presence of the royal family at the event showed the UK was apospulling out all the diplomatic stopsapos. He added that Britain is doing everything it can to ensure countries leave the conference with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming to .C within reach. Prince Charles is a long-standing environmental campaigner and has been joined in recent years by his son William, who has established the Earthshot Prize - an award recognising innovations that repair the planet.  Winners of the award, a -year project with a total prize fund of £ million, will be announced later this month. The Glasgow conference has been billed as crucial to delivering the goals of the Paris Agreement which, when it was agreed in , recognised countries needed to signicantly increase action to cut greenhouse gases.

The smash wrote off her vehicle and caused her soft tissue injuries which required physiotherapy treatment. The boyaposs car then crashed into the front offside of a Volvo heavy goods vehicle.  David Earl, prosecuting, said: The impact wrenched the steering wheel from the lorry driveraposs hands as the steering jammed. The vehicle left the carriageway, went down a bank and tipped onto its side. The driver was trapped in his cab and had to be cut out by the fire service. The HGV was damaged beyond repair.. The prosecutor said: The lorry driveraposs injuries included three fractures to his spine, a broken right scapula and soft tissue damage to his shoulder and back.

On August , the day before Grace was meant to go back to school, she had an appointment at Leicester Royal Infirmary.

Vanessa said: She was looking forward to getting the bus to school with her friends and she was just starting to get more independence with her friends.

That alarm will go offsomeone’s not breathing. And during the Covid pandemic it felt like it was going off constantly. Being an ambulance dispatcher is already a stressful job, when every day you see and hear things that most people don’t see in their letimes. But during Covid, especially during the second and third waves, the call volume went through the roof. It was the worst thing I’ve seen in my le. Every call seemed to be either someone dying of Covid, or suffering with their mental health because of the pandemic. It was like that on repeat, and that takes its toll on you.Have you struggled with your mental health in lockdown  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story There were so many people who were dying, in their homes, at the supermarket. I’d sometimes spend two to four hours talking to a suicidal caller. A couple of people have even taken their own le while on the phone. I was shocked at how many calls I was taking from elderly people who were struggling. Normally they are the strong ones, the ones who always impressed me by just battling on, yet now they were having real problems with their mental health because they’d spent so much time on their own. I would think, ‘God, you remind me of my Nan, or my Grandad’. It was a really scary time.  When someone stops breathing we always send three resources - a manager, a paramedic and an ambulance - so there are enough people to save their le. But resources were started to get really stretched. I remember on one sht when I was dispatching during the second lockdown when so many people weren’t breathing that for the first time in my career I didn’t know what to do. It felt like all of our crews were already busy with other patients.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All. We’re calling for:Early Access Mental Health Hubs for under s to be rolled out across the country, with at least one for each trust. Waiting times to be cut so people actually start treatment with a professional within four weeks The Govt to fill in the gaps in care - an end of red tape which means many don’t fit the set criteria to get help plus , more mental health staffCompulsory Mental Health education lessons in schools, plus paid counsellors in schools and care homesWant to help  Write to your MP and ask them to support the current Early Day Motion  to debate mental health and the pandemic in parliament. In  my best friend, also an emergency dispatcher, took his own le. I took it badly, and my employers paid for therapy, which carried on into the pandemic and which helped me cope during the first wave. But those sessions were now over. When you’re spending so much time dealing with suicides and deaths, you become negative. I began to feel so low and unable to cope, like I was in a bottomless pit I couldn’t get out of. I started having anxiety attacks before going to work, and was vomiting before and after every sht. I worried constantlyI would have enough ambulances and crews, and about my staff too, who were terried. I felt like the worst person when I had to send them to a Covid patient as we weren’t quite sure what we were sending them to. Access the Mirror’s mental health resource hubIt got so bad that every time the emergency alarm went off I would jump, the noise was causing me so much anxiety. I was even hearing it in my head when I went home. After every sht I would call my friend and just start crying, even though I didn’t know exactly why I was crying. I started taking antidepressants but although they helped me sleep they just made me feel numb. I asked for more therapy sessions but I was declined because there were so many other staff on the waiting list for mental health support. I’m grateful for the therapy I did get though, the weekly phone calls with a psychologist made me a stronger person and I don’t know where I’d be without them.  It’s scary how many of my colleagues are dealing with mental health issues. They are some of the strongest people I’ve ever met, and many are messaging me to tell me they are struggling too. Mental health support in the emergency services has to be the best of the best, becauseyou can’t look after yourself how can you look after others  At the moment blue light staff generally receive six to  one-hour sessions of therapy, but in some cases that isn’t enough. I firmly believe we need more funding for mental health support at every level, but especially in the emergency services where we deal with le and death situations every day.How to get help: If you are struggling or you are worried about a loved one, contact Samaritans on .

The youngster, who celebrated her second birthday this week, has spent eight weeks in three dferent intensive care units so far this year. She will now have to undergo her th operation in just a matter of days. When Ella, from Cross Hands in Carmarthenshire, Wales, was born her oesophagus was not formed correctly. Even before her birth in October,  she had also been diagnosed with Dextracardia, which means her heart was on the right hand side of her chest.  Her parents, Leah Evans and Arwel Davies, knew early on that Ella would have to be a fighter. Leah said: “From month six of the pregnancy I had to live in a hospital in Bristol in case she was born early, andshe was I needed to be in the best place for her. Ella even had to be resuscitated at birth due to being born with a myriad of health conditions, including Scimitar Heart Syndrome, Right Lung Pulmonary Hypoplasia, and Tracheo-Oesophagael Fistula, the latter of which means she can’t swallow. “On day three she had quite a big operation, which took six hours, to try to fix her oesophagus, which was split,” said Leah. On top of that, part of her oesophagus was connected to her airways and she spent nine weeks in intensive care. Since that first operation she has had  further operations which basically keep her oesophagus open.” Despite being most parents’ worst nightmare, driving Ella to the hospital in Bristol has become a part of le for Leah and Arwel. However, things took an even more frightening turn during the summer. At first she only had a bit of a cough, but the situation soon involved a le-saving operation, this time in London. “Ella woke up with a cough and doctors thought she had bronchiolitis - but she just wasn’t breathing well and was being sick, Leah said.  “She ended up spending  days in the high dependency unit in Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen, but on day  she deteriorated and was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf, before being taken to see her usual specialist in Bristol. A hole had been discovered in her airway and she was placed on advanced le support after pneumonia spread to her lungs, which had both collapsed, and she had to be sedated and ventilated for two weeks. “The milk she had been drinking had been seeping into her lungs, which caused a huge chest infection and organ failure. She had a major operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London on July , which saved her le.” Since ing from London, Ella is able to breathe and feed and go about her day as best as she can. However, the puree and milk she depends on for nutrition begins to get stuck in her oesophagus after around three weeks, hence the need for the regular trips across the Severn Bridge for yet more operations. “It’s obviously quite stressful because we have to keep an eye on her all the time, to make sure she’s breathing and feeding OK,” said Leah. “The plan was for her to have a big operation towards the end of this year that would make things easier and take away the need for the other operations every three weeks, but what she went through in July has put a halt to that plan, at least for now. “Nothing is certain. Her surgeon said it is the most severe case he has seen in years. The hope is that as she gets bigger her oesophagus will get bigger, but we don’t know what the future holds really. Our main worry is thatshe continues to have more and more operations it might cause her to have dficulties with her breathing, like she had in July.” This year alone, Ella has spent eight weeks in three dferent intensive care units, as well as the trips back and forth to Bristol for operations that have now become routine. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter During their ious trips to dferent hospitals, Leah and Arwel have been provided with accommodation close by thanks to three charity houses - Ronald McDonald House in Cardf, Cots for Tots in Bristol, and The Sick Children’s Trust in London. All have made it possible for Ella to have her parents nearby as she has undergone ious operations and stayed in hospitals, sometimes for weeks on end. To say thank you to those charity houses, the couple’s colleagues are trying to raise money so that other families can receive similar support. More than £, has already been raised through a Go Fund Me page, and fundraisers will be completing a -mile bike ride on October  - the distance from Ella’s home in west Wales to Great Ormond Street, where her le was saved in July.All the money raised will be split between the three charities, who have all made desperate times just a little bit easier for Leah and Arwel over the past two years. If you wish to donate, you can do so here. She and partner Arwel previously raised money for the Wales Air Ambulance, which airlted Ella from Bristol to Swansea in . “On one occasion the charity house was full and I had to pay £ for a night in Bristol as it was the only room I could find at the last minute,” revealed Leah. “But, thankfully, that hotel stay was a one-off: we’d be bankrupt by nowwe had to pay for hotels all the time!” Ella herself is oblivious to the whirlwind going on around her, and even smiles as she enters the ward every three weeks ready for yet another operation. “She goes into the hospital smiling because she knows all the nurses!” said Leah. “That’s lovely of course but also sad because it reminds us how often she’s been there. The last time we went, in September, I was holding her hand as they gave her the general anaesthetic and she just looked up at me and said ‘ta-ta’ as she closed her eyes.

In the latest warning for nature, the UK has recorded its lowest ever number in an annual survey of the insects.And the future looks even bleaker after ­scientists warned the decline could accelerate due to more extreme weather linked to climate change.Butterfly Conservation, which counted butterflies and moths between July  and August , said the results marked the lowest numbers since the Big Butterfly Count started years ago and called for urgent action. As well as being a vital part of the food chain, butterflies are signicant indicators of the health of the environment. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The number of peacock butterflies fell by % compared with last year, while the common blue declined by %, speckled wood by % and small tortoiseshell by %. On average, nine butterflies or moths were spotted per -minute count by , volunteers, down from  in , and  in . A handful of species, including marbled white and ringlet, rose from low levels during last year’s count. Butterfly Conservation said heavy downpours in May, when England had the highest rainfall for that month since , hampered breeding and feeding.  “Butterflies don’t like rain at all, they’re coldblooded. Effectively they’re solar-powered,” the charity said. “With more climate ­change-related extreme weather likely, the impact on some of the UK’s most loved insects could be devastating.” The State of the UK’s Butterflies report, a scientic survey last published in , found three quarters of Britain’s ­butterflies had declined since . The large blue is an exception, with numbers growing since it was reintroduced in  via caterpillars from Sweden. Julie Williams, the charity’s chief ­executive, said: “The facts are clear.

Itaposs so important to give something back infor the trust placed in me. But no training could have prepared me for what I experienced during the Covid pandemic. Whether I was treating patients, or serving my constituents in Parliament, my view of le changed fundamentally.We all know the awful toll of statistics: , dead, , hospitalised, over two million estimated to be suffering from the devastating effects of long Covid. But less is known about a serious side-effect of the crisis - its impact on peopleaposs mental health. Inevitably, things have been made worse because of a decade of neglect from the Conservative Government. Waiting lists are soaring, hospital admissions for mental illnesses are up and patients continue to be sent miles away from home for treatment. Shamefully, the Tories have cut a quarter of all mental health beds in England since . Labour would begin to put things right: weaposd guarantee mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, setting a new NHS target, and ensuring that patients start receiving appropriate treatment – not simply an initial assessment of needs – within a month of being referred. Labour would recruit , new staff so that one million more people could access treatment every year by the end of our first term in office and ensure that mental health gets its fair share every time new funding is provided to the NHS.Tory ministers are not taking the action we need to end the mental health crisis. Only Labour will enact the real change needed to improve millions of lives. It breaks my heart, as a frontline medic, to have to tell patients that the services they rely on just are not there anymore, like the addiction support services so many desperately need. With liaison nurses working flat out, emergency departments around the country - often badly short-staffed - have to send home those struggling with addiction and seeking help.This World Mental Health Day the theme is ‘Mental Health in an Unequal World’ – very fitting after the pandemic has laid bare the inequalities we all face, including here in the UK. While the virus itself doesnapost discriminate, it hasnapost hit all of our communities equally. The inequalities are vast and stark. Many of the frontline staff who died from Covid- were Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic.As Doreen Lawrence ’s review showed, the causes of Covid’s disproportionate impact on these communities were systemic. I was told of many incidents, across multiple hospitals, which showed the impact of these structural inequalities on inidual Black hospital housekeeping staff, who were being sent to clean rooms, without protective masks and gowns, after patients had died from Covid.As I saw first-hand in intensive care, row after row of patients were from our Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Some of them had, in turn, been caring for our loved ones, stacking our supermarket shelves and keeping our public transport moving.It was the health inequalities that are all too prevalent in our society that permitted the virus to ravage our communities - to the eternal shame of Tory ministers. The knock-on impact on mental health is devastating and is all too visible on the frontline including, for instance, the rising numbers of eating disorders in young Asian women.Extra s must be taken to ensure mental health treatments are tailored for specic communities. When I was training in AE, for example, I learned that in some languages, there isn’t even a word for depression – instead terms such as ‘all-over body pain’ are used to describe a range of mental illnesses. Our communities are being failed - but the Tories donapost care. Only Labour can ensure that proper action is taken before itaposs too late.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All.

The Government is also letting down a generation of young people. Even before the pandemic, children were being denied desperately needed treatment – in  , % were turned away from mental health services despite a referral from a professional. During the pandemic, this figure has soared to % of our children. They are lost in the system - the hidden victims of the pandemic and a decade of Tory cuts. Their futures are uncertain and the effect on them and their families is appalling. In AE, it often feels that the age of those coming in self-harming or with eating disorders is getting younger and younger. When I first started  years ago, it was not uncommon to see teens, but now my colleagues and I are having to treat far too many young children, often pre-teen, with some as young as . Trust in the system has been entirely degraded over time. How I hate having to be the doctor who tells another teenager that Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services simply can’t come and see them, again.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror  All our children deserve proper mental health services so their illnesses can be caught, and treated, as early as possible. That’s why the next Labour Government is committed to providing specialist mental health support in every school, to support pupils and resolve problems before they escalate. Labour would put a full-time mental health professional in every secondary school and a part-time professional in every primary school. For all the children who would feel safer accessing mental health support outside of school, Labour is committed to having an open-access mental health hub for children and young people in every community, providing early intervention and drop-in services.  Throughout the pandemic, our health and care staff have been the glue that have held our country together. The impact that Covid has placed on them, coming after years of erosion of our public services, is taking its toll. Colleagues from across the country are telling me they are burned out, exhausted beyond measure and concerned that the pressure on services means they can’t always give their patients the very best of themselves. Labour announced our Care for Carers package last June, to ensure that all three million health and care staff could get the tailored support they need as a result of the extra pressures they face because of this virus. None of us NHS and care professionals were trained to face this much death. It’s been hugely, but predictably, disappointing then that the Government has persistently ignored our concerns and those of frontline staff across the country – no amount of clapping, however well-intentioned, will ease the burden - only properly tailored support will. Ministers must stop ignoring staff. Otherwise, they shouldn’t be surprised when more and more leave the professions they love so much. I’m proud to support the Mirror’s HeadStrong campaign – it seeks to make such huge progress in reducing the stigma around mental illness, encouraging more people to seek help. We now need a government which will ensure that proper support and treatment is available when people need it the most. This Conservative Government is failing the mental health needs of our country – only Labour has a truly transformative package to tackle one of the most urgent issues of our time.

She told the BBC: Weaposve actually been seeing a rise in the number of coughs and colds and viral infections. We are mixing in a way that we havenapost been mixing over the past  months.  During those first lockdowns, we saw numbers of other [non-Covid] infections fall. We think that that was primarily due to the restrictions on meeting up.

Phone devices and computer screens are to blame for the rising risk of short-sightedness among children and young adults, say scientists. Researchers have found high levels of looking at a phone or tablet is linked with around a  per cent higher risk of short-sightedness, also known as myopia. But when it is combined with excessive computer use, that risk rose to around  per cent. Researchers fear that this could mean that by , half the world or five billion people could be short-sighted. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The authors examined more than , studies investigating smart device exposure and myopia in children and young adults aged between three months old and  years old. In , the World Health Organisation recommended children under two should not have any screen time and children aged two to five should have no more than one hour a day of sedentary screen time. But in the same year, a CensusWide survey of , British families found children were spending an average of  hours a week staring at screens. Numerous studies have also suggested that number has vastly increased during the Covid- pandemic. Professor Bourne, Professor of Ophthalmology in the Vision and Eye Research Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, said: Around half the global population is expected to have myopia by , so it is a health concern that is escalating quickly. Our study is the most comprehensive yet on this issue and shows a potential link between screen time and myopia in young people. This research comes at a time when our children have been spending more time than ever looking at screens for long periods, due to school closures, and it is clear that urgent research is needed to further understand how exposure to digital devices can affect our eyes and vision.We also know that people underestimate their own screen time, so future studies should use objective measures to capture this information. The study was published in The Lancet Digital Health.

Aviva has trawled through its archives to unearth a “treasure trove” of claims ahead of its th anniversary next month. The company’s roots can be traced back to the Hand-in-Hand Fire and Le Insurance Company, founded in . Its first policy was taken out on January ,  and the first claim was paid on May  of that year, when houses in St Stephen’s Alley, Westminster, were “damnyed by fire”. Although the company was then an insurer against fire, the organisation evolved as people’s needs changed, to cover homes, personal possessions, motoring, travel, health and personal injuries, pensions and investments.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter And researchers found that injury claims appeared throughout the archives - particularly when health and safety rules were less comprehensive than they are today. In , a surgeon suffered a “poisoned hand” when unpacking a box of drugs. Another man injured his arm when his finger was caught in a woman’s corset in , as he was trying to save her from drowning. And, in the same year, £ was awarded to someone who lost a toenail while getting into bed. Aviva said that while many of its older claims are light on detail, they also include a vicar who was awarded £ after falling while playing leap-frog in . In another case, a London hotel keeper was awarded £ and  shillings in  after being hit in the eye with a cork after opening a bottle of champagne. Looking at th century claims, a window  of a Morris Minor van was broken in  after a circus passed by.  One of its elephants put its trunk through the window, discovered the driver’s lunch and ate it, finishing it off with a loaf of bread. Unfortunately, the elephant was a tight fit in the van. In another case, in , a policyholder and his family went away for a holiday, and for safety, his we placed her jewels in the stove. On their , the stove was lit by the husband - with disastrous results for the jewellery. Anna Stone, Aviva archivist said: “It’s been a joy to have another opportunity to look at some of our oldest and quirkiest claims. “Some of them never fail to raise a smile but, in each case, we’ve been there to help customers as they’ve faced the unexpected.  “Aviva’s origins can be traced back  years so, as we celebrate this landmark, I’ve enjoyed reminding myself of the likes of a driving red setter and a hungry elephant. “Although it has to be said, we’re still adding to our log of unusual claims even today.” Aviva has also been an insurer to some famous customers, including Sir Walter Scott, Agatha Christie, Percy Bysshe Shelley, former prime minister David Lloyd George, and royals Queen Victoria and George V.

Alexis LaRue, , went viral after posing with her seven-month-old twins, with viewers left stunned at their size. She was accused of overfeeding the girls - who are both lbs - and had to share a video of her weighing her babies to prove their size. Alexis, from Minneapolis–Saint Paul in Minnesota, USA, weighed lbsand ’ before she became pregnant, but at  weeks along sheaposd increased to lbs . She gave birth to her baby girls in March with Camila arriving at : am weighing lbs oz and Elena one minute later at lbs oz. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter hereNow, at nearly seven months old, the cute tots have already tripled their birth weight at almost lbs each. Alexis said: They just really seem to enjoy trying new foods. Whenever I am eating something, they always stare at me asthey’re waiting for me to give them some. Alexis was  when she found out she was pregnant with fiancé Leo Mejia, , and was overjoyed. My one goal in le was to be a mum so I was incredibly excited it was coming true, she added. I was only six weeks along when I had my first ultrasound and we saw two little sacs on the screen. Not having any twins in our families, I was completely shocked, but I was also so excited. The stay-at-home mum added: In the twin community, it’s pretty normal to expect babies around lbs or less. I had already bought preemie-sized clothes for the twins, as I thought they were going to be very small. However, with the combined weight of almost lbs, the girls went straight into newborn and have been growing very rapidly since. Camila and Elena are eating oz of baby formula every couple of hours, and have just started moving on to solids. Dad Leo is apos, so the fact the twins have shot to apos in just over half a year has come as a surprise to the family. They are both at the top of the percentiles for weight and height, said Alexis. I do find myself having to buy them new clothes quite frequently - they are very fast growers. At seven months, they can wear anything from  months to  months clothing.As soon as the twins were born, Alexis started making videos with them for her TikTok account, @themejiafamily_ when bored at home.But they never imagined the attention the videos would bring. The mum said: It’s funny because when I posted that video, I didn’t think much of it. I actually didn’t think my babies were that big until I started reading all of the comments. Comments from astonished viewers include those are eight-year-olds” and “ they were standing on top of each other they would be taller than you”. There also comes some accusations that Alexis edits her videos or uses a filter to make the girls look larger, but says this is not true. She said: I can say, the angle of some of the videos does slightly exaggerate their size. I actually posted a video not too long ago weighing and measuring the babies so people could get an idea of how big they actually are.I do also get a lot of accusations of overfeeding them, however, it is very dficult to overfeed a baby. Their paediatrician has not had any concerns about their sizes, they are simply very fast growers. Camila and Elena are hitting all their milestones alongside being the video-sharing appaposs most famous twins. Alexis said: If there is one thing I would like everyone to know, it is to remember that all babies are dferent. They all grow at a dferent pace, mine just happens to be growing very quickly. They are very healthy, happy, and full of personality. Always remember to be kind.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The US has pledged to defend Taiwan and its independence. Despite Chinaaposs efforts to reduce the noise of the Type  subs, a report by submarine experts Eric Genevelle and Richard W. Stirn said they were likely still too loud to approach US shores undetected. Zhou Chenming, an academic at the Yuan Wang military science and technology institute in Beijing, said the latest developments were not linked to rising tensions with the US. He told the South China Morning Post: Building to commissioning a submarine can take up to eight years, while electronic and many sophisticated components would have advanced by several generations within this period.  The Chinese navy would request shipbuilders to install the most advanced facilities into the next hull, while sub engineers need to think about how to put those components in the right places. All this may require changes to hull design involving dimension, sail, rudder, number of limber holes and other factors.It comes after China threatened to ‘strike any time’ on US troops in Taiwan amid fears the attack would spark a global war, according to reports. Mr Jinping has pledged reunication with the area while Beijing responded to revelations US forces are training troops in Taiwan. China and Taiwan are at loggerheads because it is feared the Communist giant may try to reclaim the island, prompting fears World War Three could break out.

Olivier Rousteing, creative director of fashion house Balmain, shared a photo of his entire body and head covered in bandages as well as burn marks on his face.The French designer posted the picture on his Instagram account on Saturday, a year exactly after the incident.He said he finally felt ready to share his experience. “I’ve been hiding this for too long and it’s time for you to know,” he wrote. “Exactly a year ago, the fireplace inside my house exploded.”  He said he woke the next day at Parisaposs Hôpital Saint Louis, and has since been recovering from his wounds. He added that he had tried to hide the story of his injuries “from as many people as possible” and had tried to keep the secret with his teams and friends “for too long”. “To be honest I am not really sure why I was so ashamed, maybe this obsession with perfection that fashion is known for and my own insecurities…,” he continued.  Instead, he tried to hide his scars “with face masks, turtlenecks, long sleeves and even multiple rings” in photoshoots and interviews. A year on, Mr Rousteing described himself as “healed, happy and healthy” and thanked the medical staff who had treated him despite dealing with an incredible number of Covid cases at that same time”.

A seller of the deadly drink Ildar Suyunshalinov said: “I bought the alcohol at the Orsk wholesale base. “I did not know it was lethal.” Police said it is a “miracle” that more of the bootleg booze was not sold causing additional deaths.  The ages of the dead were from  to , said reports. Some of the dead were found in vehicles trying to reach hospitals after buying the alcohol which had labels suggesting it was a Siberian-label vodka. A major criminal investigation is underway with two men aged  and , and a woman, , arrested. Later it was reported that two further men and one woman were held in connection with the poisoning.

The fatalities come less than a year after seven people in Russiaaposs Far East republic of Yakutia died in November after consuming diluted hand sanitiser.

People then attempted to revive the actor but were not able to do so. The orchestra also immediately stopped playing as the stage curtain was closed in less than a minute. The audience heard people scream Get a doctor! Call an ambulance, someone got hit by the backdrop! Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Another was heard shouting: Call the ambulance, there is blood. The audience was then asked to leave. It was reported they originally thought they had witnessed a stunt or a trick that was part of the show. The distressing video, shared by Telegram channel , shows actors on stage begging staff to lt the fallen prop. The theatre confirmed that he had died during a set change in the opera Sadko on Saturday.  In a statement issued on Saturday evening, the Bolshoi said: The performance was immediately stopped, the audience was asked to leave the hall. It stated that he was badly injured and died before an ambulance arrived at the theatre. Initial reports had suggested the late actor went the wrong way as the set descended, as others suggested he was caught off guard as the decor crushed him.  Performers have since come out to defend the late actor. Nikolai Tsiskardze, once a principal dancer at the theatre told the newspaper Komsomolkaya Pravda: Backstage is hell. Dancers damage their legs when sets and staircases fall over, he said. We must not blame Yevgeny or find a scapegoat. I have been screaming about the problems of the Bolshoi for  years. There is no order, no medicine, no ethics. We are all serfs! This is all very sad.  Moscow’s Investigative Committee has also confirmed that it has started an investigation into what happened. The nightmare occurred during a set change in Sadko, an opera by Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Mr Kulesh had been performing at the theatre for nearly two decades. Tragedy also struck the theatre in  when a senior violinist, Viktor Sedov, fell into the orchestra pit and died. He was a veteran in the orchestra and had been playing for it for over four decades. There was also a scandal in  when ballet soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko was jailed for six after he arranged an acid attack on the theatre’s artistic director Sergei Filinoutside his Moscow home that led to him suffering damage to his eyesight.

noteworthy planning applications submitted to Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils over the past week. Potential changes coming to the area include proposals to demolish a petrol station#s car wash to make way for electric vehicle charging points, keeping a landfill going for an extra  years and an arty addition to Aberdeen University.Aberdeen#s Chester Hotel was one of many venues that embraced outdoor dining as bosses adapted to the challenges posed by Covid last year.A marquee was put up outside the former Hamilton School next door, which the hotel bough amid expansion plans in .The m open-sided structure ensured there was plenty space for people to enjoy a visit while remaining distant.It has proven such a hit that owners Graham and Gillian Wood are now asking for permission to keep it there for an extra year.Their application details plans for the Chester Hotel marquee to remain in place until at least next September.Will this be welcome news for the scores of diners who converted to outdoor hospitality during the pandemic, and are in no rush to get back indoors More and more drivers are choosing to join the electric highway, with recent petrol shortages fuelling demand for more eco-friendly forms of transport.And in a sign of these changing times, the Essso garage on North Anderson Drive in Aberdeen has lodged a proposal to knock down its car-wash facility and replace it with five electric vehicle charging points.The station, just off the Haudagain roundabout, is currently surrounded by roadworks amid a major project to ease congestion at the notorious bottleneck.The Motor Trade website reported on a spike in the sales of electric vehicles amid the fuel crisis.Aberdeen-based Taylor Industrial Services wants to extend the lespan of the East Hatton landfill site near Balmedie #  claiming it will take another decade to fill the dump up.The firm was granted permission to use the spot in , and recycling habits have changed so much since then that there is more room left there than originally envisaged.There has also been less waste sent to the  hectare site as a result of offshore drilling since the oil and gas downturn.The company says about % of the site hasn#t been used, and is appealing for the end date to be extended beyond .Aberdeen University#s £ million science teaching hub is nearing completion, and should be open by the start of next year.To draw attention to the new addition to the campus, plans have been formed to erect four #totems# along Beford Road.Each will be designed by a local artist, with themes of biological science, chemistry, geology, and le science and medication.One of the most signicant applications lodged was for a £. million visitor centre at Dunnottar Castle, outside Stonehaven.Owners Dunecht Estates reckon it could nearly double the historic attraction’s annual worth to the local economy.It would be would be accompanied by  houses on the other side of the Coastal Tourist Route.You

back into use.Property owner Peter Dalgarno has now lodged plans to turn a disused s office on Don Terrace into a bungalow.Scroll along to see how the building could change # The building, on a quiet back street just off Great Northern Road, was previously used by the Byron Ltd engineering firm.The Polka design agency says the layout of the home won#t dfer too much from its previous use, with just some tweaks needed to provide #a comfortable living environment#.They say: #The current Covid- pandemic and decreasing slump in the oil and gas industry has seen a major downturn in the use of office space, and this building may be dficult to lease out in the future.#The owners of Savoch Quarry at Longside want to extend the site after venturing beyond the original #permitted area# while digging.As well as asking to expand, bosses want the go-ahead to continue excavating there until  rather than  as first agreed.Savoch Quarry and Recycling Ltd say the proposals provide for the extraction of a million tonnes of rock.The former Casepoint luggage store on Inverurie High Street became an understandable casualty of the pandemic, when there weren#t many suitcases being packed.It

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area. Irsquom sure everyone will welcome the new investment and will look pragmatically at the new proposals in light of the current economic backdrop.Premier InnA spokesperson told us: ldquoThe contract we agreed with our development partner has now expired and having re-appraised the proposed -bedroom hotel in the current economic climate, it is currently unviable for [owner] Whitbread.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

Kick off is pm.For more information follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 8 2021","story":"I love how the green leaves of the trees slowly change into a golden yellow colour before the tree disperses of them and they gently fall to the ground.The tree seeks a time of rest in winter and therefore needs to let go of all its decayed leaves so that it can bud in spring and flourish in summer.Watching this process reminds me of an important lesson that we can learn from the trees as we enter into the autumn period and look ahead to the winter months.Just as the trees don#t stubbornly hold onto their dead leaves, so must we seek not to hold stubbornly onto any unnecessary hurtful weight in our lives.Ephesians  v  –  reminds us that we need to get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.Are you perhaps holding onto something that is preventing a freshness to the season ahead Could it be that the decayed leaves are piling up in your heart and you need to discard of them for good If so, why not reach out to the Lord in prayer because He longs to hear from you.Ask Him to reveal any thoughts, circumstances, issues, or any other #decayed leaves# that you may be stubbornly clinging to, so that you can release them and watch the leaves fall and drt away this season."},{"url":null,"title":"three points for pupils u17s after incredible comeback","story":"Campbeltown Pupils s ed to Kintyre last Sunday with three points after a remarkable Glasgow and District Youth Football League match.Trailing - with  minutes to go, the Ardshiel Hotel-sponsored side clawed it back and won - with an -minute winner.Despite a bright start, the Pupils were behind - after nine minutes.Two minutes later, it could have been - but for the brave defending of Kyle Paterson as he made a last ditch tackle which resulted in the youngster leaving the park with a nasty head knock # and not ing.This was a huge blow to the Pupils and worse was to follow as Cambuslang Rangers made it - from yet another set piece.Having weathered the storm, the visitors found their way back in to the game and reduced the deficit to one when Calum Ellis raced through on the th minute to make the half time score -.A positive start in the second half was quickly dampened as the North Lanarkshire side made it -.Ryan Shields closed the score line again as he raced through and showed composure with a fine finish, only to see the home side increase the lead to -  seconds later.Worse was to follow as the Cambuslang side made it - with a fine -yard strike.With  minutes remaining, it looked like the under-s were facing their first defeat of the season.However, there is a fighting spirit and never say die attitude in the teenagers that will serve them well as they develop into the adult game.With a spirited team display by every single player, Calum Ellis scored to make it - before pulling another back with  minutes to go.The equaliser was to follow on the th minute from Ellis before he scored his fth of the day with a penalty box scramble to make it - to the Campbeltown side.#This was a truly remarkable comeback in a game that will be talked about for many a year,# said manager David Paterson.The s have no game this Sunday due to the school holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraiser-raises-700-walk-scott-foundation","story":"Iain Donaldson-Elder, , a former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil, participated in this yearrsquos recent Walk with Scott.Walkers covered  miles across East Lothian and Iain joined at Haddington as they made their way to the town rugby club after following the Longniddry to Haddington railway walk.Accompanied by Jim Liddle, from Leuchie House, a respite centre near North Berwick for people with MS and other long-term conditions, Iain ldquorolled his wheelchair for about three miles and was delighted to receive a certicate as a Scotter of the Year from Councillor Colin McGinn.Iain told the Courier: ldquoThe walk itself was wonderful, emotional and, although short, very rewarding as I got to meet people that I had only known through Facebook.

One of the first books I remember was a battered old hardback collection of legends about the British Isles that my grandmother would read to me by the fire on dark autumn nights. It set me up for a letime of fascination with mythologies from across the world. Once ancient Celtic and British tales had whetted my appetite, I was off to Greece to meet Zeus, then on to Rome to spend time with Romulus and from there my travels took to me to Egypt with Isis and Osiris, Sumer and the wild adventures of Gilgamesh, then onto the lands of the Norse with Loki at Ragnarok.Irsquove been travelling in space and time through mythology for decades now ndash discovering the lives and minds of ancient people in the Americas, Africa and the South Seas. So I gleefully paw my way through any new anthology when it appears ndash looking for something fresh, some tale or insight Irsquove yet to discover, all the while hoping that each new book that arrives will inspire others to fall in love with the foundation stories which shape the remarkable tale of human le.Jeffs is at her best when shersquos sting through the soil of ancient mythology for nuggets of truth, trying to uncover what fact may lie within a myth. Itrsquos a hard job, like uncovering the microscopic grain of grit which formed the pearl inside an oyster. The study of the truths which lie within myths is known as Euhemerism. The best example is the myth of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks discovered the skulls of mammoths lying buried deep under their fields. When these huge skulls were excavated, they appeared to have one giant eye in the middle of the forehead ndash itrsquos where the trunk wouldrsquove been. However, Ancient Greeks, unaware of long dead beasts called mammoths, assumed these were the skulls of a giant with one eye ndash and up grew stories of the Cyclops. Likewise, the legend of the Gryphon ndash that strange bird-monster of mythology ndash began in central Asia where the fossilised nests of dinosaurs were found by ancient peoples, together with eggs and the bones of creatures that seemed like giant, monstrous birds.Jeffs takes us back to the foundation of Britain when legend tells us that mysterious people from the east settled our islands. First comes Albina, the rebellious daughter of a king from the lands where Syria now sits. Not long after the Flood, shersquos cast out by her father and lands in Britain ndash gting us the name of ldquoAlbion for the entirety of the British Isles. Later, Brutus, a descendant of Troy searching for a home, arrives on these shores. He gives us the name ldquoBritain, corrupted from ldquoBrutus.We know that the people who first settled these islands did indeed come from somewhere to the east. Ancient DNA tells us that. So, is there some cultural memory echoing within these myths that Jeffs tells  Are these legends a remnant of ancient migration  Do they tell a story about the very mixed blood which runs through our mongrel veins The legends of the Scots have eastern echoes too. If you read the text of the  Declaration of Arbroath, yoursquoll see references made by the authors to those who founded Scotland coming from ldquoGreater Scythia via the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and living in Spain among the fiercest tribes for many years. That implies a journey from the Russian steppe via the Med, past Gibraltar to the western shores of Spain. Jeffs tells of Scota, the foreign queen who settled first in Ireland and gave her name to the tribe, the Scotti, whorsquod one day settle Scotland. In Scotarsquos myth she travels from the eastern Mediterranean to Spain, then on to Ireland. History shows that the Irish ldquoScotti tribe eventually came to dominate Scotland. Scota had a son called Hyber ndash he gives his name to Hiberniaand the Iberian peninsula.Studies of ancient DNA have linked northern Spain and Portugal to Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall ndash old Celtic lands. Our myths contain hints of something deep that wersquoll never understand ndash stories about migration from east to west, of a staging post in Spain, of settlement in these islands, thought to be the very end of the world in ancient times. It makes the mind wander. What brought these people all the way here  Might perhaps the survivors of a shattered civilisation ndash even Troy, which we know today did exist as a city and was destroyed in the Bronze Age ndash have made their way here more than , years ago to build a new le  Is that what these myths ndash layered by millennia of retelling ndash whisper For this strange frisson of partially glimpsed knowledge, Jeffsrsquos book is worth the cover price alone. And yet, as a work on British mythology this beautul book issomewhat lacking. Although itrsquos built chronologically, starting back in prehistory and working forward to the time of the Picts then William the Conqueror, the book is strangely compiled. Therersquos a looseness about the story selection, a slightness to the tellings.At times, the tales donrsquot hang together as a collection. The sense of a unying mythos is missing as yoursquod expect with a primer on Greek, Roman or Norse legends. Some stories start and end randomly. Therersquos also a feyness ndash almost diaphanous dreaminess ndash to the writing which seems misplaced. Feyness is for fairy tales ndash and myths arenrsquot fairy tales. Myths are rough beasts. Jeffs, who has the elegant hand of an artist as proved by her gorgeous linocut illustrations, should perhaps have been harsher, more direct in her tellings."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-bowie-stephen-flynn-christine-jardine-appear-brian-taylor-podcast","story":"With the Supreme Court ruling, the Conservative party conference and the NHS, host Brian Taylor and Alistair Grant of The Heralds political team have taken listeners through the latest in Scottishpolitics with the help of an expert political .This week, we have appearances from:Listeners to the podcast have access to an exclusive subscription discount code, entitling them to % off our incredible annual rate, heard only through the live stream and recorded episodes.There are a few ways you can listen to all the episodes of The Brian Taylor Podcast so far.Apple PodcastsThe podcast is available on Apple Podcasts -you have an iPhone, iPad, Macbook or another Apple product, download the Apple Podcasts app.Either click the button above or click this link to be directed straight to our podcast home and get the latest episode.Make sure you hit the subscribe button and be instantly notied whenever we publish a new episode.SpotyThis podcast is also available on Spoty.

Wersquove been exchanging the occasional gt for more than  years now. Not only did the book take twice as long to reach him as it did before Brexit, but he had to collect it from the sorting office and pay euro customs charges. The value of the item on the customs declaration form was pound. If this is how Brexit can affect a private inidual, what is it like for those who are trying to export to EU countries All this could have been avoided by the UK leaving the EU but remaining in the single market and customs union. It has now become equally obvious that lack of freedom of movement of people has landed the UK with its huge labour shortage. Expect more special work visas to be issued as the truth begins to bite in many sectors of the economy.Itrsquos the denials which I find bizarre. Anyone with half a brain can see that Brexit has been bad news for the UK. Wersquove treated our European allies like dirt, created major dficulties for UK export businesses, damaged the lives of UK citizens settled in EU countries , got into yet another mess with Northern Ireland, and shown Britain to be untrustworthy when it comes to signed agreements.Irsquom still waiting for some honest reservations to be uttered by those who voted Leave, evenpride prevents them from offering the actual apology that we Remainers deserve.Dave Stewart, Glasgow.HAVE FAITH IN FELLOW SCOTSROBERT IG Scottasks ldquowhat benefits would Scotland derive from the SNPrsquos dream of independence . It is a simple question requiring a voluminous answer and to simply the answer, I say look at similar-sized countries of Europe and where. Naturally SNP supporters wish to see Scotland become independent, but there are many voters from other parties who also support independence and will vote accordingly when the time comes.The Little Englander view of the UK is somewhat inward-looking as it is not only the UK which is multi-cultural but the wider world. Look beyond UK borders and blue passports and have faith in your fellow Scots to make a go of things.Independence would change everything and give the people some hope from the real mess created under successive Westminster governments over a long period of time. More of the same is our future right now and how much better to ldquotake back control and run ourselves with a government chosen from parties standing only in Scotland whether that be SNP, Conservative, Labour or from other newly-formed parties. In Scotlandrsquos past history lies our future.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BORDERS THAT REALLY HURTROBERT IG Scott would like the Scotland England border to be consigned to the history books with the UK retained in its present form for ever more. He fails to share his attitude to Brexit through which the voters south of that border in his beloved UK have imposed a border at the English Channel and another across the island of Ireland, casting us adrt from our fellow Europeans and endangering both the hard-won peace settlement in Ireland and the fellowship among the major European nations which the EU had brought about.The EU was as precious to me and millions of others as the UK is to Mr Scott.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.BENEFITS OF INDEPENDENCEROBERT IG Scott asks what benefits Scotland would derive from restoring its independence. Letrsquos start with the most obvious. It would give us a government that is directly accountable to the people of Scotland, meaning we would no longer suffer rule by a government we didnrsquot vote for, and havenrsquot, since .Second, it would give us control over our economy. We would be able to set our own interest rates and make tax, spending and investment decisions for the benefit of Scotland, not England. We could keep our money and not have to send half to Westminster. We could eliminate poverty, raise the miserly state pension, invest in health, education, social care and a greener economy, creating millions of good well-paid jobs.Third, it would give us control over our considerable natural resources ndash oil, renewables, forestry, fishing, and land. Had we managed our oil ourselves, we could have created a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, to secure the future of generations of Scots. We canrsquot allow Westminster to steal our renewables and water as climate change accelerates.Fourth, independence means we could make our own foreign policy, and not be ripped from the worldrsquos largest free trading bloc against our will. We could manage our defence at a much lower cost and remove weapons of mass destruction from our soil. We could sign international agreements like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child without being slapped down for exceeding our authority.The benefits of reclaiming our sovereignty are overwhelming. Lets get on with it.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.NO CLEAR INDY MANDATEFRASER Grantrefers to the May Scottish Parliament election results and how the fact that the SNP won  seats as against only  by the other parties and says that provides a clear mandate for Indyref.While these statistics are accurate, further examination shows that the  seats were won with . per cent of the total votes cast in the constituency vote. The SNP won .% of the total votes cast in the regional vote and of the combined votes cast in both elements of the election the SNP won .% of the total. While this shows strong support for the SNP it clearly does not demonstrate a clear mandate for Indyref.Simply repeating the claim \"we have a clear cast-iron mandate for Indyref\" does not make it become true.James Hamilton, Glasgow.PUT SEPARATION ON BALLOTSWHILE I sympathise with Jill Stephensons frustration with the distortion caused by leading referendum questionsI fear that her well-meaning intention to rebalance a second referendum question for it to say \"lsquoShould Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\" would have unforeseen repercussions.Indyref is often spoken about as a simple repeat of Indyref and most ordinary people who dont follow the exact minutiae of politics would assume the same and look at it in the context of their last vote on the same subject. For No to become Yes and Yes to become No would only confuse people. I can well imagine tens of thousands of people thinking that they were reaffirming support for the same thing as they did last time ndash or registering that theyve changed their mind from last time ndash only to realise afterwards that they were actually voting for the exact opposite of what they wanted.I agree with Ms Stephenson that the pro-nationalist phrasing of the  vote was unfair, but we have to play the hand weve been dealt ndash to change could actually skew results even further. If there is to be a second referendum, andit is to have a \"Yes No\" question, it will have to be the same one as last time.Ideally though the least ambiguous answers should be statements of what would actually happen. Accepting that \"Remain Leave\" has been contaminated by the Brexit debate and cannot be used, \"Union Separation\"would be more direct and less judgemental than \"Yes No\".Robert Frazer, Dundee.* FOLLOWING on from the contribution from Peter A RussellI propose the referendum ballot paper should consist of two boxes: one marked ldquoIndependence and the other marked ldquoDependence.The latter seems to be a good description of the state most supporters of the status quo consider Scotland to be in.This should overcome the ldquoYes bias issue to everyonersquos satisfaction.Cameron Crawford, Rothesay.VERILY A DING-DONGI ALWAYS enjoy the political ding-dong on your Letters Pages: the Tories criticising everything about Scotland, loathing the SNP, and now those dreadful Greens too, and the independence supporters hitting back with their forceful responses.The saddest letters are from Labour supporters. Normally older and male, these contributors seem to live in the past and cant accept that Labour are now irrelevant to younger Scots.

He offered us a lt to Ballachullish, we didnrsquot refuse. Each held their own bike, we sat on the lorry. What magnicent scenery all round.Maryrsquos travelogue notes that while the scenery around Glenfinnan was also impressive, the roads were less so. ldquoBeautul scenery, she wrote. ldquoBut the road becomes dreadful. Gosh stones, holes and no road in places.ldquoA lorry full of sand going past stopped and took all four of us, bikes  all.The kindness of strangers and camaraderie among fellow travellers is a common theme running through her diary. Having been dropped off, the trio went in search of food only to find a hillside house empty.ldquoWe drank water from the burn and ate dry bread. A passing motorist and three women passengers stopped and gave us lemonade.The sisters crossed from Mallaig to the Isle of Skye, taking in a glorious sunset that cast a multitude of colours on the still water of a loch and marvelling at miles of moor with nothing but sheep and heather.Their journey saw them travel from Kyle of Lochalsh south through Dalwhinnie to Dunkeld before swinging east for Coupar Angus, and then turning for home via Perth, Dunblane, Fintry and Bearsden.While it would have taken a physical toll, the sisters made do with basic meals, some provided by locals happy to share their own food with the unlikely adventurers.Other times they simply had to make do: as they headed to Invergarry and having climbed four miles uphill with their bikes, the trio dined on ldquobare bread, cheese and water. But it was good, wrote Mary.Their most pleasing times were spent staying in one of the many youth hostels that had sprung up in the previous five years.Mary, one of a rapidly growing number of Hostelling Scotland members at the time, wrote of encountering fellow travellers, swapping stories and freshening up ndash once bathing in a tub filled by kettles of boiling water, and on another occasion under a cold shower. ldquoGee, there were howls, she wrote.While the epic -day trail might have earned them a rest, the sisters arrived home anxious to get going again.ldquoThe end of a great holiday while we wait eagerly for the time to come again, Mary concluded.Having arrived home, the sisters were soon ready to head off again ndash the next day they packed their haversacks and set off for an -day cycle tour of Northern Ireland.A spokesperson for Hostelling Scotland said: ldquoSince , bike technology and bike apparel has evolved considerably but the roads have got incredibly busy and a great deal more dangerous for cyclists.ldquoHowever, the mentality of exploration and the thirst for adventure has always remained strong.ldquoCycling is an accessible form of sustainable tourism, and Youth Hostels are great, affordable bases for cycling adventures throughout Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-give-ted-talk-part-countdown-cop26-series","story":"The First Minister will set out Scotlands ambitions on climatechange on theinternational stage speaking about the role of smaller countries in climate action, aspart of the TEDCountdown to COP series.The Countdown Summit will bring together leaders in Edinburgh from October -, with speakers sharing their blueprint for a net zero future.Its the first-ever in-person TED climate conference, withpoliticians, business leaders, policy makers, scientists, Indigenous leaders, artists, philanthropists, and youth activists gathering in Scotlands capital for four days.Its not the first time Sturgeon has done a TED talk as she previously spoke for the  in July  on the subject, Why governments should prioritize well-being.The talk has accumulated nearly .m views.The following day, on October ,the First Minister will take on another major speechatthe Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjaviacutek, Iceland.She will talk to Scotlandrsquos links with Arctic nations and how all countries must work together to tackle the climate emergency.Other speakers will include the Prime Minister of Iceland, the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries.:Sturgeon challenged to rip up Heathrow Airport deal before COPThe First Minister said: \"We are now just three weeks away from what will be one of the most important global gatherings of the st century.\"COP is our best and possibly last chance to achieve what is required to deliver the goals of the Paris Agreement and safeguard our planet.ldquoThe world must move from promises to action, and mobilise the ambition, finance, resources and joint working needed to deliver on the Paris Agreement goals.

But pupils had to also develop their presentation skills to explain their design plans to their peers.The Spaceflight Programme, run by the UK Space Agency, has invested over £M to develop three spaceports in Cornwall, Shetland and Sutherland. The UK will soon have the ability to launch small satellites from horizontal and vertical launchers operating from spaceports located around the UK, including the SaxaVord UK Spaceport in Unst.The work done by Shetland pupils will be submitted for judging, with the winning designs announced in the coming weeks.Head Teacher at Whalsay School Garry Spence said: “Our pupils have worked really well together in their groups and they’ve been fully engaged with this competition. They’ve learned a lot about spaceports and we hope some of them have been inspired to consider work in the space industry, which realistically could soon be in Shetland.”..Shetland is on the cusp of a major boost with the UK government ready to approve the creation of an isles spaceport in Unst – aTwo inspection reports have been ed for isles schools, providing mixed results.#Nothing has changed# in the race to bring a spaceport to Unst.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have supported us through the process of applying for the Innovate UK Challenge Fund to address the current and future impacts of Covid-.

We continue to develop our core product ranges of hearses and limousines and have several new vehicles under development.”Speaking about the ongoing support received by the council, Patrick added:“Through our interaction with Council’s Business Client Manager, Barbara Orr we have received support through the Business Escalator and Business Escalator Plus Programmes to develop our export markets and growth development. The support through the programmes and assistance from Barbara has been truly worthwhile and I would recommend that businesses in our borough take advantage of the help available.“As we continue to move forward, we aim to make use of the assistance in the many dferent areas of running our business, to grow and create more jobs for the people of Ballymena.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “Quinn Hearse  Limousine is just one of many companies across Mid and East Antrim to have benefitted from support via Council’s Amply programmes, since the launch of our economic development strategy in .“As well as supporting our SMEs to navigate through the current challenges posed by COVID-, we are preparing for the new economic landscape as we navigate post lockdown, and have provided expert guidance to support Quinn Hearse  Limousine with its longer-term business development strategy.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Business Escalator and Escalator Plus Programmes are part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.To find out more make an enquiry today via midandeastantrim.gov.uk EscalatorPlus "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633709144535.jpg--covid_19___fri_8th_october_figures.jpg?1633709144000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211008newscovid 19 fri 8th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

One thing I don’t agree with is to put a woman in a position just to tick a box, but to put a woman in a position in her own right.“I feel you need to support women and ask them to step forward, and allow them to make their own decision, and that’s what we’ve done.“This year especially has definitely seen steep rise in interest of women joining the ranks of the party we have teachers, accountants, farmers, stay-at-home-mums and everyone in between of all ages which really is a breath of fresh air for the party.“We want to show the world the extraordinary, talented women we already have in politics, and celebrate those who have gone before us, to inspire the next generation of girls to step up and join us as a Union of People.”Laura Turnerhas only joined the party in the past year and is already progressing as a Lagan Valley candidate in the upcoming Assembly election.“I first took part in a cross-community initiative led by the Department of Foreign Affairs about six years ago and that was really what highlighted to me the lack of confident women in unionism, and I aspired to become one of those,” she said.“So over the past few years I have been active in promoting women’s voices at grassroots level, and I feel this new  will just help further cement that drive to be able to represent women in unionism.“If you take policy scrutiny, it would be flawed on principleit didn’t have a women’s perspective.”Laura said that Saturday was her very first time attending a UUP conference, and she decided to enter the world of politics for the very first time only earlier this year ago because the qualities of the party was something she could “fully align with”.“Since the beginning I have just felt valued, accepted and supported by the UUP,” she said.“I strongly believe more female representation is needed and in the party there is a real, authentic drive to encourage more women into politics.”Turner added that the reason for the increased emphasis on female politicians is “not just about gender equality, we all got here on our own merit, so it’s about representing the needs of the people with a women’s perspective”.“With Doug at the helm, we believe that we can now be heard and provide a voice for future generations, while also being proactive in delivering the solutions,” she said.Commenting on the recently released UUP election broadcast which features a same-sex couple, Laura simply stated “love is love”.“I’m all for progressive politics and forward-thinking ideals,” she said.“The video perfectly encapsulated what the union of people is all about, I think there is more to be said about how we treat each other, there needs to be mutual respect there.“The Ulster Unionist Party are definitely youth advocates, aiming towards a younger, fresher vision, they are our future generation and leaders after all so we must preserve and nurture these voices.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDoug BeattieUlster Unionist PartyMore On Doug Beattie PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionStatesmanlike leader Doug Beattie doesn’t miss a step with a speech on the move PremiumAmy CochraneOpinionIt’s the all-singing, all-dancing UUP, but is this what the ‘everyday’ person wants Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann issues fresh plea against ‘vaccine lies’ as four further deaths recorded PremiumGail WalkerOpinionDUP and UUP need to lose the misogyny and attract women to win the case for the Union PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionWhat’s in a name: call it Derry, or call it Londonderry… I call it stupidMost ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of children‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmer‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streetsPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’sTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandUTV’s Ruth Gorman elected chair of Northern Ireland Football Writers’ AssociationMore than  parks and open spaces across NI recognised with Green Flag awardRevealed: £m in funding to help welfare claimants was handed back after being left unspentStars from golden age of Northern Ireland wrestling reunite to recall their days in the ringPart-time model Zara Doherty: ‘It became a choice between heroin and my child.

Speaking during a recent meeting of Stormont#s Communities Committee, DfC official Cherrie Arnold provided a breakdown of this funding.This included funding we needed to close the loopholes in both social sector size criteriaand the benefit cap mitigation schemes, she said The total estimated for these benefit mitigations in   was £.m, included in that original requirement.This included £.m for closing the loopholes. There was also expenditure factored in for closing the social sector size criteria loophole, this was a lot smaller at £,.Obviously you will be aware then, we surrendered £m in this monitoring round.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen said: The failure, to date, of the Executive Office to allow welfare mitigation legislation to be introduced to the Executive has resulted in the Department for Communities handing back, in the October monitoring round, £m to the Department of Finance that had been agreed in April.This is money that was allocated to support iniduals and families adversely impacted by welfare reform mitigation loopholes.There is no greater example of failure than denying our most vulnerable money that they desperately need.I would also call on the Communities Minister to clary whether approval to introduce the legislation has been received at the recent Executive meeting.The Department for Communities has been contacted for comment..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDeirdre HargeyAndy AllenDepartment for CommunitiesDepartment of Finance More On Deirdre HargeyStormont department bids for £m to fund Universal Credit uplt… but cost will jump to over £mStormont to look at ways of keeping up welfare paymentsStop ‘cruel and unjustiable’ Universal Credit cut, minister is urged PremiumCost of living crisis ‘puts our most vulnerable people at risk’ PremiumNorthern Ireland pub rules: Publicans say changes ‘a long time coming’Most ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of children‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmer‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streetsPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’sTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandDan McFarland warns of threat posed to UlsterLions start to roarPictured: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’s amusement parkUTV’s Ruth Gorman elected chair of Northern Ireland Football Writers’ AssociationMore than  parks and open spaces across NI recognised with Green Flag awardStars from golden age of Northern Ireland wrestling reunite to recall their days in the ringLatestDan McFarland warns of threat posed to UlsterLions start to roarWe must lick our wounds and turn fire on Bulgaria, says Ian BaracloughStephen CraiganOpinionWe all want players to decide games not refereesTaliban says US will provide humanitarian aid to AfghanistanGlobal charity urges Premier League clubs to help ‘talented’ African players,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Andrew MilliganRalph HewittTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer Celtic manager Neil Lennon has claimed some of his players pulled out of fixtures when fit as Rangers halted the club’s -in-a-row quest last season.The Lurgan man resigned as manager of the Parkhead club in February after taking charge of Celtic for the second time in  when Brendan Rodgers left for Leicester City.He led the Old Firm outfit to two League titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup in that period.The former Celtic captain faced angry protests from fans who were furious the club had fallen so far behind Steven Gerrard’s Rangers in the title race — effectively ending their bid to win the league for an unprecedented th consecutive season.Lennonsaid some of his former players had “just got to the end of the road” after winning nine league titles in a row and four trebles.“You could see it pre-season, the body language, they weren’t with us,” he told The Scottish Sun. “You could smell it.Some players could have played but didn’t, Lennon added, although he stopped short of saying they were feigning injury.

I have always wanted to work abroad.”The former Bolton Wanderers manager also dismissed suggestions he is too fiery and said “all the best managers have an edge”.“People have a misconception of me being volatile, but I know how to win trophies,” Lennon added..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsCeltic FCRangers FCMore On Celtic FC PremiumStephen CraiganOpinionHearts or Hibernian really could steal Rangers or Celtic’s Champions League places this season by finishing in the top twoAnge Postecoglou hits out at ‘condescending’ element of Scottish media as scrutiny mounts over Celtic start PremiumJulian TaylorOpinionCeltic captain Callum McGregor can be an inspiration to all at Parkhead PremiumStephen CraiganOpinionAnge Postecoglou has to adapt his philosophy as Celtic’s greatest strength is also their biggest weaknessAnge Postecoglou: Celtic fans are behind me despite slow startMost ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of children‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmer‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streetsPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’sTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandMark Allen thrills Waterfront crowd with his first home maximumDan McFarland warns of threat posed to UlsterLions start to roarPictured: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’s amusement parkUTV’s Ruth Gorman elected chair of Northern Ireland Football Writers’ AssociationMore than  parks and open spaces across NI recognised with Green Flag awardLatestMark Allen thrills Waterfront crowd with his first home maximumPressure from Swiss crowd led to Jamal Lewis’ red card, says Craig CathcartPaul FergusonOpinionA miscarriage of justice kills off the Qatar dreamDan McFarland warns of threat posed to UlsterLions start to roarWe must lick our wounds and turn fire on Bulgaria, says Ian Baraclough,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Peter MorrisonAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFor the first time in almost three decades, figures from the golden age of Northern Irish wrestling met up for a reunion in Belfast at the weekend, providing a glimpse into a world where characters with names like the Lone Wolf and Ricky Valentine reigned supreme.Long retired wrestlers gathered at the Lansdowne Hotel to reminisce and share stories about the industry back in the s and s. The event was the work of Nick Campbell, who promotes wrestling shows here and has written a book on the history of the sport on these shores, entitled Falls, Brawls and Town Halls: The History of Professional Wrestling in Northern Ireland.Theroom in the hotel was like travelling back in time, decked out with old promotional wrestling posters from shows here and clippings telling stories from the ring.Speaking to the Belfast , Nick spoke about how the event and his book came to be.I actually put on local wrestling shows here and was very interested in what came before us. I had heard of course of Fit Finlay, the most famous wrestler from Northern Ireland, who fought in the s and s, so I looked at people who wrestled around the same time, he said.I got in touch with an old wrestler from Belfast called Eddie Hamill and some of the stories he told me were just incredible. Over time I met other wrestlers and the family of Fit Finlay, his father Dave and sister Wendy, and I just went from there. Wrestling back then and wrestling now are just dferent worlds. Speaking to wrestlers like Ricky Valentine, the Lone Wolf, and Noel Arnott — who is NI#s oldest living former pro wrestler at  — I knew I had to write the book.The book is half oral history and half drawn from research, old newspaper articles, posters and things. It took me the best part of two years and I#m really happy with the results.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFit Finlay, who is Dave’s son FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFit Finlay, who is Dave’s sonDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up So what is the dference between pro wrestling #back in the day#, compared to now  Nick pointed out that there were only a few TV channels in the s and s, so live entertainment was a huge draw.There were events in places like Enniskillen where there were , people in attendance, featuring legendary wrestlers like Giant Haystacks. Events in Portrush drew , to , fans and there were even bigger shows in the Ulster Hall and the King#s Hall, Nick said.Today the reality is everyone is fighting for the attention andyou want to make a living out of wrestling, you have to get out of Ireland really. The scene here now is grand, but it#s so dferent than what it was. It#s great to have everyone here, because the last time these people had a reunion was in , when I was two years old.The Belfastalso spoke to Wendy Finlay, who, in addition to being the sister of wrestling royalty, was one of the first ever female referees in the industry. Her father Dave was also a wrestler and promoter.She praised the event and Nick’s working bringing everyone together.When my dad took up the wrestling I always wanted to be with him, but he kept saying #it#s for men#, which I didn#t agree with. But I kept at him and he eventually let me join him. So my brother and I helped to build rings and were travelling to shows all the time. That led to coaching and then refereeing.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDave in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDave in I was always there supporting Fit and my dad. I have such fond memories of that time, lots of stories — some you wouldn#t tell! Wrestling now is so dferent than it was back then, it#s night and day really. My dad finds it hard to get his head around, but you have to move with the times.This event is fantastic, just seeing everyone again, especially for my dad too. What Nick has done is just amazing.Falls, Brawls and Town Halls: The History of Professional Wrestling in Northern Ireland is available to buy now from Amazon and bookstores. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of children‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmer‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streetsPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’sTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandMark Allen thrills Waterfront crowd with his first home maximumDan McFarland warns of threat posed to UlsterLions start to roarPictured: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’s amusement parkUTV’s Ruth Gorman elected chair of Northern Ireland Football Writers’ AssociationMore than  parks and open spaces across NI recognised with Green Flag awardLatestMark Allen thrills Waterfront crowd with his first home maximumPressure from Swiss crowd led to Jamal Lewis’ red card, says Craig CathcartPaul FergusonOpinionA miscarriage of justice kills off the Qatar dreamDan McFarland warns of threat posed to UlsterLions start to roarWe must lick our wounds and turn fire on Bulgaria, says Ian Baraclough,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Alan Currie Getty ImagesGillian HallidayTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNearly two decades on from Lisburn achieving city status, UUP Alderman Jim Dillon has recalled how, in the lead-up to the decision being announced and celebrated with the popping of champagne corks, an official visit was made to the area by then Labour Secretary of State Dr John Reid.At that point, Mr Dillon was mayor, and had been forewarned by a civil servant that Dr Reid, now Baron Reid of Cardowan, had a two-hour window and “not a minute more”.This was two months before the Secretary of State’s visit, and as Mr Dillon noted, it was important Mr Reid left with a good impression, saying: “The Secretary of State plays a big part in it. The day he came and the two hours were up, the secretary walked over to him and said, ‘We need to go now’. He said: ‘Have you another packet of fags  I’ll be here at least another hour yet’.“I came back to my secretary an hour and a quarter later and threw my hands up in the air, [saying], ‘We’re going to get this, we’re going to get this’.”When the secretary asked why he was so sure, he replied, “I just got the vibes today”.The decision was announced by then Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine in March  as part of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee celebrations, giving Lisburn a lord mayor title as well. Other places across the UK received the title.For Northern Ireland, it was a tale of two cities as Newry was also conferred with city status, with Carrickfergus and Ballymena in Co Antrim, Coleraine in Co Londonderry, and Craigavon in Co Armagh missing out.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up This year, the award is for the monarch’s Platinum milestone next year, and Ballymena is in the running for a third time, as well as Bangor.Those hoping to secure the title for their respective towns will, like Mr Dillon, be hoping for positive vibes this time round.Following the announcement  years ago, it was argued, somewhat cynically, that adding the word ‘city’ after Lisburn and Newry was simply an act of political expediency, with Lisburn pleasing unionists and Newry pleasing nationalists.Regardless, Mr Dillon insisted it was a good decision and extolled the benefits it has brought the area in the years since.“Some people will tell you that it has done a whole lot for Lisburn, and others will tell you that it’s done nothing. It’s as simple as that, but people who think it hasn’t [done anything] are not thinking people,” he said. “Cities have to start somewhere. [Modern] London started hundreds of years ago as a small town. It’s a multi-national city now. Lisburn is growing, and the problems we have are planning issues over the last while. We want to expand in dferent directions. Planning takes light years,it gets through at all.“I still think that getting city status was a good boost for Lisburn. It has allowed us to grow, despite all the dficulties. “People want to come and invest in us, simply because we are a city.”Has the award put paid to the perception some people have that Lisburn is merely a satellite of Belfast that will one day be subsumed by the capital The UUP alderman was adamant that would never happen.“In  years’ time, people will see what it has done for Lisburn. Lisburn is not a suburb of Belfast. Lisburn would never join up with Belfast. They are two very dferent places,” he stressed.“People can speculate, but it’s not going to happen. Lisburn is a very thriving place.”Former Newry and Armagh MLA Danny Kennedy was a councillor when he proposed the idea of Newry applying for city status.It was reported at the time that Sinn Fein opposed the move to become a city because of the award’s links with the Queen’s Golden Jubilee.Mr Kennedy remembers a more pragmatic response. “[While] it’s fair to say [the reaction] wasn’t exactly enthusiastic at the time, they had indicated that they wouldn’t object. It was initially a lukewarm reception from the SDLP but it became warmer,” he said, stressing that the combined unionist and SDLP support helped get the project off the ground.“What did help was the reaction and influence of the chamber of commerce. They [councillors] then quickly saw the benefits to the area.“People who were key influences in education and commerce, they in turn reached out to the wider community. “The application then took off and, crucially, avoided the political pitfall you would have thought would come with that.”In the wake of the announcement of city status, Sinn Fein’s Davy Hyland, at that point the council’s chairman, welcomed the decision, telling the BBC: “Royalism wouldn’t be a very strong aspect of le here. The main thing is the recognition that it is now a city.”The late Seamus Mallon, at that time the local SDLP MP, also praised the decision, saying it was a “great day” for the area that pointed towards a “bright future for the city of Newry”.“This is a great day for Newry and represents a strong recognition of the work which has taken place in the city in recent times,” Mr Mallon added.Jaded thinking, however, was a harder stumbling block to overcome, said Mr Kennedy.“Some people were cynical about that, saying that Newry was a town and would always be a town,” he explained.“People were cynical again when both Lisburn and Newry were awarded it, saying it was a political trade-off. People, to this day, still say that. I’ve no evidence for that.“There was genuine goodwill and they were able to assemble a group of businesspeople and sportspeople like [former Northern Ireland footballer] Pat Jennings to come on board. Figures who were recognised as leading in their fields.“It became the creature of the chamber, rather than the council. And that made it easier in some ways because it took the politics out of it.“If I got up every week and asked, ‘Any word from the Queen yet ’, that wasn’t going to work.”While he acknowledged that some people still do not see Newry as a city, he said the status had brought many benefits.“I think it’s worthwhile. You could stand on ceremony and say, ‘Now, hang on. They haven’t got two cathedrals, they haven’t got the population’,” he added.“It’s not on the level of New York and it’s not on the level of those great English cities like Liverpool and Manchester, but there is economic and cultural benefit to it.”A framed copy of the Queen’s certicate conferring the status hangs in Mr Kennedy’s home.“I’m proud of it. It’s not an exclusive achievement of myself, but I was happy to be involved,” he said.“Success has many fathers. I did propose it at council level, but I would concede that most of the spadework was done by the Newry chamber and others.”City status may be a thorny issue that falls along orange and green lines, but it can also reignite long-standing rivalries between towns. Ards and North Down Borough Council recently gave Bangor the green light to pursue city status, but it prompted consternation from councillors who represent other areas, including Newtownards.Alistair Cathcart, a DUP councillor for Bangor Central who proposed that the council support the application, insisted it was a “no-brainer”. “Why go for this now  Because the opportunity is now,” he said.“We simply don’t know when the next opportunity will arise. It’s been  years since the last opportunity. It could be another  or  years into the future for the next one.”Other representatives felt otherwise. Joe Boyle, an SDLP, councillor for the Ards Peninsula branded it “embarrassing,” while Angus Carson, a UUP councillor, denounced it as an April Fool’s joke, insisting Bangor was “going down the tubes”.DUP Alderman Stephen McIlveen, who represents Newtownards, insisted his issue with it went beyond the old rivalry between the two towns, saying it was more to do with what a city is in principle.“The process they have is that any town can apply for city status,” he said. “A lot of people will look at certain towns and think, ‘This does not fit my idea of what a city should be’.“The idea that you can have this process devalues what a city like Belfast or Londonderry might be. “A city should be an economic driver. The idea that somewhere like Ballymena, Bangor or the idea of Lisburn [as a city], a lot of people still cannot accept that because it doesn’t meet the perception of what a city is. Does that devalue what a city is ”Mr McIlveen stressed he would not support a similar proposal for his town. “I feel exactly the same way about Newtownards. I’m guessing thatyou spoke to a lot of people in Newtownards, they would feel the same way,” he explained.“The concern among the chamber in Newtownards is that Bangor,did get city status, it may adversely affect them. “While I’m a councillor for the whole borough, I am a representative for the whole Newtownards town and I have to advocate for them. “If they [Bangor] get it, great. It’s a tremendous honour to attain, but I’m not too sure that many people still consider [Bangor] worthy of being a city.”Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma agreed.  “I have lived in Bangor for over  years, I have raised my family in Bangor, I love living in Bangor, but I am from London, and Bangor is not a city,” she said.The idea of what defines a city is a concept that fascinates architect Mark Hackett, who operates a practice in Belfast and has written articles for Architectural Review magazine.He believes cities are made by citizens, rather than being made in top-down processes.“Just calling something a city doesn’t make it a city. It’s more emotional than that,” he said. “I’m talking about it more from an urban theory point of view. If you want to have a cohesive city, it needs to have a lot of things in it that people have a lot of pride in. “The ability for people to gather and express civic pride, or civic displeasure or dissent, is a very important thing. If you can’t do that, then it’s not a city or, indeed, a town.”What matters is not whether a place is a town or a city, he argued, but whether it is a “good town, a good city”, regardless of status: “It’s not about the aspiration of getting the title of city conferred from someone . It’s not important how other people decide what your status is. It’s how the residents are. Are they truly invested in their town or their city ”Alderman Audrey Wales MBE, who proposed Ballymena’s application at Mid and East Antrim council, believes the town meets the criteria and more.“Ballymena is a wonderful place. Our citizens are forward-thinking and hard-working, and it really does deserve to be a city,” she said.Itwins, it will be a case of third time lucky. As well as missing out in , Ballymena made an attempt in , when one UK town was to be granted city status to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.Although Ballymena was nominated on that occasion, it was later withdrawn.“Everyone is looking forward to it just as much as last time,” said Ms Wales.She also stressed there was no rivalry with nearby towns, with the application “fully supported by Larne and Carrickfergus”.As part of the process, applicants must demonstrate “distinct identity”, civic pride, heritage, history, tradition and association with royalty.Carrickfergus could have good reason to apply for city status, given its royal links. Along with its castle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Baron and Lady Carrickfergus titles were conferred on Prince William and his we Catherine by Her Majesty on their marriage in .While it was not nominated, Ms Wales believes the general feeling is thatBallymena were to be successful, it would have a positive effect on the wider area overall.It would also be somewhat poetic, given the town already welcomes visitors with a sign reading “Ballymena: the City of the Seven Towers” — a proclamation that reflects the spires that once defined its skyline.Ms Wales said: “We’re known as that, so it would be nice to get that status confirmed.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of children‘Google Me’ loyalist thug threatened to burn out farmer‘Mad Dog’ stooge who cut his ex’s throat back on the streetsPicture exclusive: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’sTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b--ff-acfe-ecebc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayTaoiseach in #solution mode# to address NI Protocol issuesPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandPictured: Le is a rollercoaster for Derry Girls stars as they film at Barry’s amusement parkUTV’s Ruth Gorman elected chair of Northern Ireland Football Writers’ AssociationMore than  parks and open spaces across NI recognised with Green Flag awardRevealed: £m in funding to help welfare claimants was handed back after being left unspentStars from golden age of Northern Ireland wrestling reunite to recall their days in the ringLatestGlobal charity urges Premier League clubs to help ‘talented’ African playersPatients facing ‘postcode lottery’ with huge GP disparities across EnglandFootball rumours: Juventus want Paul Pogba with Aaron Ramsey set to leaveUTV’s Ruth Gorman elected chair of Northern Ireland Football Writers’ AssociationRecord increases in firms’ costs driving price rises, bank report finds,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Included are staff who organised the retirement lunch.Reporter: Paddy Leonard Oct   addthis, Derry disablity centre Destined hosted a celebration event yesterday to wish one of its founding members well on his retirement. Colm Cusack, a founding member of Destined and until recently the services Secretary and a member on its Board of Directors. He was also the Centre Manager when the group was based in Great James Street and was responsible for everything from a tea bag to toilet roll. googletag.cmd.push He has been described as the face of Destined for visitors calling to the centre who would often receive a complimentary cup of tea. Colm headed up the older peoples group and organised many activities such as visits to the Bowling Alley, the Millennium Forum and Playhouse, restaurants and bars throughout the city. He was involved every year in the preparations for the St Patricks Day and Halloween parades. Colm was also instrumental in setting up the Friendship Club and supported the older members to undertake training to learn how to use mobile phones, how to text and email, and how to access the internet to reduce their levels of isolation.  Colm Cusack celebrates his retirement clients and staff at Destined. PHOTOS: Tom Heaney, nwpresspics  The new North West Learning Disability Centre was named the Cusack Centre in recognition of all the work that Colm has contributed to the learning disability community in the city. Speaking at the presentation, Destineds Dermot O’Hara said: “Colm has been a mainstay of the group since it started. He was the first person you met in the morning and always had a joke or laugh to share with everyone. “He will be missed in the coming future but we want him to know that he will always be welcome to call into Destined. I want to wish him well for the future and hope that he has a healthy and good retirement.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

This counted as P.E in the s. Long before the days of groups being brought out rock climbing or kayaking, the kids of the s were walking around the P.E hall trying to balance tiny beanbags on their heads. It never made it past the Olympic sport application, though, but we hold out hope. Teachers really had it handy back in the day! googletag.cmd.push The bin was a social hub... Getting continually chastised for talking in class was the bane of the existence of a s primary school pupil. We found a novel solution, however, as we all bought p pencil pairers and took full advantage of the rule that said pencils had to be paired at the bin and nowhere . The chats were had and many a firm friendship blossomed at the bin in the corner of the classroom. The school tour game was weak... In the s, school tours normally consisted of a trip to a local farm where the farmer was only delighted to welcome  screaming children to his place of work - NOT. We spent most of the day looking at cows and chickens, complaining about the smell, and the highlight of the day was bottle-feeding a baby goat. Those were the days, eh  What we would have given for a day trip to Tayto Park! The Don arrived... Whether it was by chance or design, for some reason on a random day during the s, artist Don Conroy from RTEs The Den turned up and drew an owl. We had to follow his instructions on a piece of copy paper and iniably ended up with a misshapen circle on top of an oval, after which we got distracted and went to the bin for another chat.     Mistakes were made... At one point or another, someone in the class made an absolute mess of the maths problems and proceeded to erase every screed of writing from his her page using a eraser. The smell of burning rubber wafted through the classroom asit was Mondello Park and poor Peters arm never recovered from the repetitive strain injury. What  could he do  Tipp-ex was strictly not allowed! Our books were routinely wallpapered... Covering school books was the order of the day because we all used the schools book lending scheme. You got the books that were used forty years earlier and in order to protect them, your poor mother had to spend the whole evening plastering them in wallpaper. Colours and styles did not matter to your beleaguered mother whatever wallpaper was left over went on, that was that! The telly was rolled in... REJOICE! At school in the s, the telly carried with it a God-like status. There was utter pandemonium when the teacher pushed it into class. The level of reaction could only have been equalledshe had pushed The Backstreet Boys in on a trolley. Absolute scenes! Iniably, the excitement dissipated when a farming or water safety video was produced, which was minus craic, but very important. Nevertheless, that momentary thrill of hearing its wheels squeaking down the hall and emerging through the door was the highlight of our primary school education. We had The News... In the very early years of primary school, we were required to write the news into our copies. The news was far from exciting and usually involved a classmates tooth falling out, trips to the zoo, or other random happenings in our non-eventful lives. In fairness, we were only five! Today is Wednesday...it is a rainy day. Accurate to this day! Ah, the memories! The Shatterproof Ruler Experiment... All of us, at one point or another, splashed out on the p shatterproof ruler from the school shop and conducted our own unofficial experiment to see could we actually shatter it. We proceeded to bend and contort the unsuspecting ruler furiously, our faces grimaced in anticipation of the impending snap. The experiment had mixed results. Some of us lost eyes due to the shrapnel, others were simply left with a bent-out-of-shape ruler in their pencil case with white strain marks down the middle. We had pencil toppers... These normally arrived free in cereal boxes and we upended the box of Corn Flakes in order to be able to go to school with a troll on top of our pencils – the absolute envy of the entire class. Trolls were popular but the toppers came in all shapes and sizes. Hey Arnolds head certainly made an appearance at one stage.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Ambition is important. Yes, that’s true. Without a level of ambition, in the modern world, we would probably be lost. We wouldn’t be sure where to go or what to do next and of course what we would like to accomplish. googletag.cmd.push The word ambition has a dferent meaning for everyone. For one person it may mean to be in good health. For another, it may mean to rise to the top of the corporate ladder. Or maybe you want to be the best parent you can be. But sometimes, ambition makes us blind and we lose sight of the reasons behind this initial ambition. Chasing something is an example of how we lose sight in the fog of ambition. Where it turns to: “I don’t have enough in le currently or presently”. Be it, more cars, more money, more houses etc. This is where ambition turns to the need for more and more. The want of “more” unfortunately will never satisfy any of us. It may have its fleeting moments of happiness where the ego becomes your shadow side - meaning that it is lurking somewhere in the background, having more control over your thoughts, feelings and actions than you may initially think. Ego is important. I would argue that it is detrimental to our happiness and fulfillment, in a physical and mental sense, when we are blinded by the ego and all it wants for us is more of something or maybe even someone.     Our ultimate mission is inidual to each and every one of us however our mission or purpose does share commonalities. We are inspired when we think of our mission. We are frightened of our mission as we are afraid of what we truly know we can accomplish once we put our minds to it. We get a sense of happiness at the thought of our mission being complete. Overall, there may be a procrastinating pull and a satisfactory push when we think of what our purpose is,we have not found it yet or taking action towards it. Society is not designed in a way for us to find our purpose and true calling. We have to go and find it ourselves. Efficiency has led to a personal deficiency where being proactive is admired and recognised more so than a person’s recognition for the need to rest. Let’s look at a question we often ask others: “Are you busy ” Questioning the “busyness” of someone  is a worthwhile example of how we are conditioned into framing conversations and boxing another human being’s value into whether they are “busy” or not. Yes, while it may be a good way to start conversation, I would question this very question as a measure of efficiency in our daily lives as existential as it may be. We have to question these things and examine where we can improve on our ways of interacting socially leading to meaningful friendships and relationships. I don’t mean that on an efficiency level but more on a deeper, human connection level Nobody has this le figured out. Many people are seen to be thought leaders in self-help, for example, but they don’t have it figured out either. Whilst the conceptualisation of certain ideas may provoke thought and conversation , nobody has it fully figured out and each one of us are on our own inidual path. I say this to support the idea that there seems to always be a drive toward efficiency in the modern world and this can now be seen in new thought leadership on self-help. We now have step by step guides, habits, graphs, routines etc. that tell us how to be more efficient - from people who certainly, although maybe experienced, do not have the answers you or I seek. Efficiency, in my eyes, is the curse to simplicity which I believe is one of the keys to living a happy, stress free le. When we strip back layers of the ego’s needs, what are we left with  I would assume that we are left with a very fragile, vulnerable and lost person which is why we need to have a certain level of ego in our lives. However, we can be mindful of what aspects of the ego we tend to build. So in an ego driven world that almost demands efficiency, leads to a spiritual and mental deficiency where we may forget to nurture certain aspects of ourselves. I would advocate a strategy that would be congruent to your overall daily set of values or importantly your sense of purpose or your mission. For example: “My mission is to be a great mother”. Firstly, define what “great mother” means to you. Does it mean fulfilling the basic food, shelter, emotional needs of your child or does it surpass that  Whatever your purpose, define what success means to you, not the world’s demand for efficiency. Overall, an Americanised, McDonalds culture of “getting stuff done” has filtered its way into most of the Western world. Whilst efficiency is welcome in certain aspects of our lives, be it our cars, coffee machines and checkouts - at what point do we press the stop button on a robotic like efficiency that we human beings have also now become accustomed to in our relationship with ourselves and others  It takes strength and often courage to get off the hamster wheel - be it your self-sabotaging belief systems, patterns of destructive behavior, your career, the role in your relationships - however, I would strongly advocate stepping back from the busy demands of le and re-evaluating what it is you really value.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Acting through their solicitor, the Montagu Estate have issued a statement expressing regret that Portstewart Town Hall had been subject to years of neglect during its time under the control of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. googletag.cmd.push The town hall sits on a number of sites provided by the Montagu Estate to the Portstewart townspeople, and the family have said much of the land had been abandoned by those responsible for it. Ever since John Cromie named Portstewart in  he and his successors, now the Montagu Estate, provided lands for specic amenities for the townspeople of Portstewart, they said. This seems to have been forgotten over the years. Our predecessors provided the Cromie Institute, land for the Warren Playing Fields, the Primary School, the Headland, the Crescent foreshore, the Harbour and other many other parcels of land some of which are now in dispute as they have been abandoned by those to whom they had been endowed. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all. Independent councillor for the area, Angela Mulholland, said the community had reached out to the Montagu estate to attempt to find a solution.     The people of Portstewart are devastated at the prospect of losing our town hall, she said. We fully appreciate and share the disappointment and frustration felt by the Montagu family regarding Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils stewardship of the town hall. We,too, feelthattheCouncilhave notservedasgoodcustodiansofPortstewarttownhall,or asgoodpublicservantsof thecommunityofPortstewart.

Wewanttorally thecommunitytoactively engageinrestoringourtown hallandtheotherareasthat have been left neglected for so long. When contacted, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said they intended to issue a statement on the town hall next week. After the Special Council meeting where they approved the hand over after seeking legal advice, Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. ”The ownership of Portstewart Town Hall has been under detailed consideration by Council for over two years,” he said. “In March , the Council made a decision which was not challenged using any of the normal channels, either call-in or rescinding motion. “That decision was to acknowledge the Montagu Estate’s Notice to Quit and the nub of the issue here is the ownership of the building. “While the council is progressing with the hand back of the building, the community is free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. “Preliminary work to establish the need for community space in Portstewart has already begun as proposed by council members.  Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.    County Derry community group ‘deeply disappointed’ by town hall handover  The group also expressed frustration that meetings were held in private.    Council to proceed with handover of County Derry town hall  The Mayor said the community were ‘free to negotiate’ with the owners over its use.

Drumboe left Whitehead in Co Antrim, where it has been restored, early on Saturday on its way to the Donegal Railway Heritage Museum in Donegal Town where it will go on display. googletag.cmd.push The -tonne engine, which travelled on a low-loader, passed through Derry, Strabane, Stranorlar, Ballybofey and Barnesmore Gap, before arriving in Donegal Town. It stopped at the Tinneys in Strabane, the former site of the railway station to which it made its last journey in December . The engine also stopped on Barnesmore Gap, the scene of many iconic photographs of the engine in its heyday. Following its arrivial in Donegal Town, Drumboe will be lted into position on a new presentation  at the museum. The Drumboe engine was one of half a dozen built for the Donegal railways in  and . It has become the iconic steam engine of the era of railways in Donegal.Two years in the making The project tothe engine into the county cost €, with funding from Leader on top of fundraising. Theof the engine has been more than two years in the making. As well as the restoration of the engine, the project has included the building of a new presentation  and canopy at the museum. The manager of the museum Nial McCaughan explained there is a lot of excitement about theof the engine.     “This is a big thing for the museum but also for the county,” he said. “This is the first Donegal steam engine to be back in the county.

So it has come full circle - it is coming back to Donegal Town and it is a great thing for us all.” He said there are plans that the engine, which has been restored “from a rusting hulk,” will be run again on tracks in Donegal. Most of the engine has been fully restored to an operational state so that when funding becomes available, it could go back into steam. “We would love to put Drumboe back in operation - that is that plan,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bundoran RNLI inshore leboat responded after a swimmer was caught in a rip current off the townrsquos main beach on SundayNational NewsWoman airlted to hospital after getting into dficulty off Donegal beach overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Some of the damage caused at the site.Local NewsEquipment set on fire at County Derry mental health charity overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

He is currently renovating a studio on his family land in Donegal, Ireland. He exhibits nationally and internationally, showing at the Dublin Castle, The London Art Fair and the Saatchi Gallery with Cynthia Corbett and the Young Masters Art Prize, the Victoria, and Albert Museum “What is Luxury” with Unknown Fields Division and Toby Smith. Other shows include “GLOBALE: Infosphere” ZKM Museum, Karlsruhe, Germany and Van Abbe-museum, Eindhoven. He was selected to represent Ireland in The Ceramic Context Biennale in Bornholm Art Museum in  He collaborated with Dublin architect Peter Carroll from A architects at The European Culture Centre in Venice May-Nov , participated in the Landmark series with Sky Arts representing Scotland, commissioned by Sky Arts to produce a piece of sculpture in  days. He also has a solo show in Dec-Jan at Stallan-Brand Gallery in Glasgow  Kevin completed a residency at The Irish Culture Centre in Paris in August . Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

A source close to the country star has said It becomes a big story for Garthhe gets the five nights at Croke Park he was denied before. Three nights won’t be enough. googletag.cmd.push He wants his full five shows at leasthe is ever toto Ireland. Hundreds of residents in the Croke Park area met beside the venue last week with stadium management and Aiken Promotions with concerns over the amount of concerts being planned. Residents are outraged that there could be seven potential concerts held next year and it could go to the High Court, but Dublin City Council could still refuse as they did back in . As it stands under restrictions, only three gigs can take place in Croke Park in a calendar year between January and February. As there has not been a live show in Croke Park since July , Aiken Promotions have been hoping that this would allow them room to negotiate for more gigs in . Garth Brooks May Move Gigs To Aviva If  Croker Nights Falls Through - https:t.co JfNXSWs pic qjsWujjA — Radio Nova  October ,     Pending this decision, insiders say that Brooks is willing to move some of his shows to the Aviva Stadium,hes request for five nights at Croker is denied. “But Garth could do three nights in Croke Park then another three concerts in the Aviva Stadium”,the source continued.     “He could do what Ed Sheeran did in  and add in even more concerts around the regions. This is also causing issues as Sheeran himself has booked two concerts in April . Research has shown that each Brooks gig could possibly generate €million to the local economy. Another study also showed that one concert ticket sold for a Brooks concert would provide € spent in the local area. “They remained steadfast before, and there’s no reason to think they’ll cave in to Garth this time”. “DCC are more into bicycles than heavy lorries so it doesn’t take much imagination to get their view on a fleet of heavy artics rolling in and out of Croke Park for an unprecedented numbers of concerts, added the source. The country singeris already pencilled in to perform in Croke Park for September ,  and  in .Applications have already been lodged to get two extra dates added to this.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage.

The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm. After leading out the EDAC team at the Road Relay Champs in style, he ed to Victoria Park in Belfast for the weekly parkrun.These events are not races but timed runs open to anyone who registers. Neil was taking part as a training exercise in his group coached by Mark Kirk.He lead the pack in with a super slick . for the k which was reported later as being the third quickest parkrun time recorded at any of the weekend parkruns throughout the UK.We donrsquot normally report on parkrun as it is impossible to keep on top of all the activity, but this one is worth a mention. Well done for putting EDAC on the map.We are always open to new senior members and have acquired quite a few recently who are glad that they have taken the plunge.We are an all rounder club with members chasing speed, distance and the challenges but we also have a main body who come to training to keep fit and enjoy the good company.If you are interested, please email Donal at membership@eastdownac for details..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie.jpg","title":"Francie builds boat with recycled material  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man is realising his dream of building a river boat by using recycled materials such as wood pallets and aluminium.Instead of costing around pound, for a new boat of the same size and specication, Francie Morgan aims to finish his ft boat on a budget of pound,.The  year-old intends to launch the four-berth boat from Carrybridge in Upper Lough Erne in Co Fermanagh next May, with the help and support of his family and many friends.But before that, he would love to enter it as a float in next yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.While the main structure is complete, Francie will be working over the winter and spring to fit out the inside.The father-of-seven began to build the boat last year during lockdown and scoured scrape-yards and recycled materials yards to get items which either cost him a fraction of their original price or where the owners were only too happy to get rid of them.ldquoTherersquos men who are only too happy to see me coming to take away some pallets. It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what

Primary School in Crossgar.Nine representatives from a primary school, a hospital and a church of the Embangweni Station sang Malawian songs and shared stories about their home with the pupils.With the aim of the visit to share cultures the visitors were offered Irish stew and watched the pupils perform Irish dancing.The school children were amazed to hear how their guests had never been on a

themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative

the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a

community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side.

The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13082558.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularAlmost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannPUP annual conference: Billy Hutchinson tells members that ‘shared island is a hood’‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’Thousands of chickens killed as NIFRS tackle large shed fire at Northern Ireland farmNorthern Ireland gospel preachers arrested by Gardai are to go on trial in Republic of Ireland after preaching against homosexualityMost PopularHenry McDonald: Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’Ben Lowry: Echoes of , as Boris Johnson fails to proclaim his unionism in his keynote speech to ToriesRoyal Military Police officer has recalled taking a rle from accused veteran Dennis Hutchings, but cannot confirm the weapon was his, a judge has heardTwitter spat between Simon Coveney and Lord Frost over NI ProtocolUlster Unionist Conference: Doug Beattie sets UUP sights on first minister job as he insists ‘we are back’                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...And yet on reading the actual column Toibin wrote it was evident that the author had not deviated at all from his long time pluralistic, scrupulously fair and nuanced take on Northern Ireland.He started out by referencing the Queen and her historic, ground-breaking visit to the Republic back in . The novelist recalled talking to British diplomats a few months before she would arrive in Dublin. He remembered urging them not to compel herto use one loaded word — ‘sorry’. Toibin reflected in his article that, “The word ‘sorry’ was debased. Everyone was always sorry. Very few people who said they were sorry really meant it. Nor should the Queen express remorse or apology. The Queen in Ireland should not say anything that she did not mean.”Staying focussed on the Queen’s visit Toibin continued: “On  May  the Queen spoke with great delicacy and tact in Dublin Castle. She did not apologise for anything. She merely said something that happens to be true: ‘With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done dferently or not at all’.”Courageously, Toibin also challenged the cosy consensus in the Irish media that Brexit had somehow completely changed the matrices of relationships between Irish and British people, which appeared to reach such a positive apex during the royal visit to Ireland.“None of this was ever going to change after Brexit. Irish soccer fans will still support English teams Irish people still have cousins in England and go to England looking for work Northern Irish people will still see Scotland as close to home. England still represents freedom for many Irish people,” Toibin wrote.Excoriating not only Sinn Fein but also those politicians in Ireland’s traditionally dominant parties, Toibin warned against them wrapping the Green Flag around their torsos in order to harvest support from a younger, more neo-nationalist population south of the border.“Their talk of a united Ireland ‘in my letime’ is mystical blather, but it has the power to unsettle a fragile political environment. Also, it will do nothing to keep Sinn Féin at bay. “It will do nothing either to solve the more pressing and immediate problem of sour relations at official level between Ireland and Britain after Brexit. It is another example of politicians saying something they don’t mean.”In his column Toibin too recollected his visits to Protestant churches where funerals of murder victims took place in the IRA killing fields of Fermanagh during the Troubles. He reminded readers about the deep wounds inflicted upon border unionist communities during those dark days. His moving testimony, a powerful echo of his superb book about walking those borderlands in the s, was a welcome balm to all the waspish, stinging anti-Brit rhetoric that has infected southern Irish public discourse over the last few years.The novelist even had the guts to raise awkward questions such as why people in Northern Ireland would give up an NHS that is free albeit flawed to one that in his words is a “dysal health system” down south.Colm Toibin’s column was a welcome, realistic, refreshing intervention amidst all the misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’ in the post-Brexit era. It demonstrates that there are still voices in the Republic who maintain a sensible, pragmatic, nuanced outlook about Northern Ireland and especially towards the people there that still prefer to be part of the UK.His column originally in  was headline-neutral: ‘Will the Brexit fall out lead to a United Ireland ’, the paper asked.Toibin was at the very least sceptical about that prospect at present although you would never have known thatyou took The  headline over the same text as an indication of what the author was actually trying to say. Which begs more questions about the state of The  these days and its apparent abandonment of pluralism in both the states of Ireland.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

While some of this has been the consequence of some political commentators not actually reading the invitation, others have been engaged in deliberately misleading the public.In particular, Fianna Fail TD Cathal Crowe’s statement on Clare Byrne’s RTE radio program on Thursday in tandem with statements from Sinn Fein TD’s were inaccurate.

It says and I quote: “The service will provide the opportunity for honest reflection on the past one hundred years, with the acknowledgment of failures and hurts, but also with a clear affirmation of our shared commitment to building a future marked by peace, reconciliation, and a commitment to the common good. The overriding theme will be that of ‘Hope’.”How can anyone claim that these words describe the event as a “commemoration”.It is therefore totally appropriate that we should participate in this ecumenical service.John Cushnahan, Ex Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP, Co Limerick——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...But it has been more pleasing to see a cooler reaction to his snub from much of the Irish establishment, including John Cushnahan, right, who has a distinguished political career on both sides of the border.It is particularly encouraging to learn the Simon Coveney will now attend the service. The Irish foreign minister has been at the heart of the greening of mainstream Dublin politics, and has taken a partisan nationalist approach to isive issues in NI such as the Irish language.While the Irish government, currently led by the thoughtful and admirable Micheál Martin, has defended Mr Higgins’ right not to attend, it is now clear that they actually think the president’s decision was regrettable.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Councillor Sam Nicholson.Businesses providing separatetoilets for male, female, disabled and baby changing receivea higher fee than those offering just one unisex toilet.The matter was originally tentativelydiscussed by the environmental services committee in November and December  before ing to the agenda in August  with an updated report on the matter presented to members of the committee on Tuesday, October .The community toilet scheme was initially considered as a way to deal with any potential shortfall in public toilet facilities in Portadown, however, the report notes the toilet facilities in Portadown ’s building on William Street are now operational and are under contract until April .With regards to a pilot for the scheme, the report suggests Lurgan and Portadown as two suitable areas.At present,Lurgan has four free to use facilities along with  pubs and caféswhile Portadown has eight free to use facilities along with  pubs and cafés.Members were also made aware that Derry City and Strabane Council launched its own Community Toilet Scheme in April  and have  participating businesses.Councillor Sam Nicholson asked businesses had previously expressed interest in the scheme but was advised businesses had never really been approached about the scheme by Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience.“It had been brought to committee on a number of occasions to seewe wanted to go to businesses,” said Mr Patience.“The only thing we have done is identy those locations so there is some detail for Portadown and Lurgan as possible sites for a trial.“We have not approached businesses yet. “Members had previously said they would be happy to hear more information about the scheme so this is us bringing that further information back.”Councillor Nicholson said it would be worth “asking the question” to businesses and proposed a workshop to discuss the potential objectives, scope and outcomes of any potential scheme.His proposal was seconded by Alderman Stephen Moutray who said it would be worth “exploring the merit” of this proposal.“This is potentially an opportunity to provide more facilities for people in our town centreswe go ahead with this,” he said.“As long as we are sure this has not already been discussed with businesses then I am happy to second the proposal that this is explored further in a workshop.”Read this:- Halloween back with a bangEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
