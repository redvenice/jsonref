It is lobbying the Government to introduce a one-off stamp duty-free move to encourage older homeowners to downsize in retirement.The premise is that slashing moving costs for pensioners will help free up larger homes for those further down the ladder and thus stimulate the housing market. It would also release capital to see them through retirement (and possibly slip a few thousand to desperate children and grandchildren struggling to get on the housing ladder).         Pilates teacher Jackie Brealey, 60, and her husband Mick, 61, a motorcycle instructor. ‘We put up with our old two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with a tiny garden for ten years, but craved space both indoors and outdoors for living and entertaining,’ says Jackie         The couple sold their home in Surrey, pictured, for £365,000 and moved to HampshireCertainly, there is support for the idea. After all, when adult children have flown the nest, many retirees are left rattling around houses with far more rooms than they need. Plus, larger homes and gardens become more tiresome to manage in older age.Yet, curiously, upsizing is a fast-growing trend. A recent report found that 46 per cent of homeowners aged 55 to 74 had spent extra money on their latest move. And 28 per cent of those had bought a bigger property with more bedrooms, despite many people in this age group living either alone or as a couple, found the study by the Cambridge Centre for Housing \u0026amp Planning Research and the National House Building Council (NHBC) .Dr Elle Boag, a senior lecturer in social psychology at Birmingham City University, says upsizing in later life can have a magical effect on both inidual wellbeing and harmony within a marriage.‘For many over-50s, this will be the first time in their lives that they’ve had the opportunity to buy the home they really want now their kids have grown up and they have more disposable income,’ she explains.‘My husband and I downsized from a large five-bed to a three-bed when the children left home, but I’m now upsizing again because I miss the space and luxuries such as en-suite bathrooms, a study each for my husband and me, a downstairs loo and the option to use a bedroom as a yoga room if I want to.’She adds: ‘By the time they hit 50, many people start to question: “Who am I saving all this money for?” If your children are self-sufficient and you want to buy a bigger house, why shouldn’t you? If you can afford to do it, upsizing is good for you, while downsizing can have a very negative impact on a relationship.‘If you’ve been in a large house and you decide to downsize once the children have left home then, suddenly, you’re going to be living in much closer proximity to your partner or spouse again, which can ruin relationships.’Debi Ireland agrees. Not that her children have expressed resentment. ‘We’ve served our time in much smaller properties during our respective marriages and latterly together for four years in Surrey, and have always put our children first,’ she reflects. ‘We were desperate to get away from the traffic and noise down there and move back up north, where we’re both from, to a period cottage or barn with glorious views and oceans of space indoors and out.‘We decided that as soon as David retired in 2017, we’d make the dream happen.’Having sold the mortgage-free house in Surrey for £660,000, they each added savings to top up the pot and paid cash for their barn.‘When David first showed me the brochure, I was worried the barn looked too isolated, mindful that, in older age, we need to be close to amenities and a community,’ says Debi. ‘But before the estate agent arrived to meet us, I’d peered through the windows and fallen in love with it.’Small wonder, given that it has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, a spacious living room with brick inglenook fireplace, a large farmhouse kitchen, a family room and even a studio for Debi’s photography. A farmer has promised to clear the lane of snow in the winter in return for his sheep grazing on four acres of Debi and David’s land. They pay a local man with a sit-on mower to tackle the other acre.‘A few of my friends questioned whether upsizing was right at our age. But we’ve worked hard all our lives, raised our children and now it’s time for us,’ says Debi.‘We both help our kids out as much as we can, because we recognise that it’s difficult for the younger generation to get on the housing ladder these days. We want them to have the best lives they can — but we also want the same for ourselves.’It’s a similar tale for Pilates teacher Jackie Brealey, 60, and her husband Mick, 61, a motorcycle instructor. ‘We put up with our old two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with a tiny garden for ten years, but craved space both indoors and outdoors for living and entertaining,’ says Jackie.She and Mick have four children between them, aged 42, 38, 30 and 25, plus four grandchildren and another on the way. Three of the children own property, though none as big as their parents’ home.Three years ago, the couple cashed in by selling their pricey, but tiny, mortgage-free property in Surrey for £365,000 and went house-hunting in Hampshire to get more for their money. Their lives and relationship have improved exponentially as a result.‘We fell in love with a detached Sixties house with spacious rooms, three large bedrooms, big windows and half an acre of garden and paid £440,000 for it, using savings and a chunk of my pension to remain mortgage-free,’ says Jackie.‘Almost immediately, we added a large extension costing £50,000 on the back of it, to create an open-plan living space.’And they don’t feel they have anything to apologise for: ‘All our money is in the property now and, one way or another, it will all end up going to the kids, so it’s hardly as if we’ve blown their inheritance by upsizing.‘We helped out one of the children with a deposit for a home and help all of them financially in other ways. We don’t feel guilty at all about upsizing now. The property is an investment for the future.‘Upsizing was a lifestyle choice for us. We love entertaining, but, if we invited even two friends over for dinner at our old house, it was a squeeze. Now, we throw parties all year round and have discovered that we both love gardening.‘Inside, even the third bedroom is so huge that it doubles as a Pilates studio if I teach from home, and we’ve earmarked it for conversion to a “granny annexe” if ever our elderly parents need to live with us.‘Friends and family were dubious about us upsizing and asked us: “What the hell are you going to do with that huge garden?” But we love it. We’re not overlooked here, and Mick and I often sit in the garden with a cup of tea in the evenings and watch bats and shooting stars.’Had it not been for them upsizing to a spacious four-bedroom home near Faversham, Kent, in October 2015, charity directors Margaret Lee-Roberts, 69, and her husband Trevor, 75, a retired project manager, wouldn’t know the joy of having three of their six grandchildren to sleep over every Thursday.They previously lived in a tiny three-bedroom home on the first and second floor above a ground-floor business premises.‘We raised our family in a large, four-bedroom Victorian house, but then downsized to our last home when we suddenly needed to live closer to my late father when he became ill. In hindsight, we bought in haste,’ says Margaret.

It’s absolute bliss to have so much space after all those years feeling cooped up.‘We even have one room full of toys for when our daughter’s three children come to stay on a Thursday while she works late as a psychology teacher.‘There’s a bus stop and a supermarket close by, so we can catch the bus into Canterbury if ever we reach the stage when we can’t drive.’She adds: ‘Pensioners are entitled to live as they choose, especially when they’ve worked hard to own their properties. Many, like us, have lots of visitors to stay. My generation don’t live very differently from younger generations.‘Why shouldn’t you enjoy space at home at our age if you can afford it? We tried downsizing and it didn’t work for us.‘This is our forever home — and we’re never leaving.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Booze parties holidays Brussels spends cash","story":"Share this article The UK pays around £9billion to the EU each year and the bloc is demanding £39billion as part of the Brexit orce bill agreed by Theresa May – even if there is No Deal.

Suffolk bang was said to have a meagre flavour and was so rock hard – “harder than the devil” – that it needed to be warmed up to become vaguely edible. This disappointing foodstuff was known as a “flotten” cheese because it was made from skimmed milk. But the cheesemakers of the county insisted that it wasn’t their fault their cheese, once highly regarded, had “grown into disrepute”. In 1690, they wrote a petition to parliament complaining that the cheesemongers of London had forced them to skim ever more cream off their milk to make butter, the result being that Suffolk’s cheeses had become “only fit for slaves”.As this story illustrates, cheese in Britain has always been up and down. At the moment, happily, it is up, argues Ned Palmer, a former jazz pianist turned cheesemonger, in this delightful and informative romp through centuries of British cheesemaking.Palmer suggests that the long history of cheese in Britain is not one of simple decline or progress but of cycles of excellence followed by periods of compromise and disappointment. The 15th century, for example, seems to have been a golden era for British cheese, when hard, Parmesan-like cheeses were sold in foreign markets on the back of the wool trade. An Italian expert wrote that Britain’s rich pastures made the country’s cheeses excellent and abundant. Some of those sold in late medieval England included nettle (equivalent to Cornish Yarg today), cream cheese, morning milk cheese (similar to single gloucester) and angelot cheese, a reblochon-style creation made from the very creamiest milk. Yet a few centuries later, with industrialisation, the abundance and ersity were waning. In November 1935, TS Eliot wrote a letter to the Times suggesting that good British cheese, from Stilton to “noble old cheshire”, was on the brink of extinction.Now, according to Palmer, we are once again in an era of miraculous resurgence for British cheese. In the UK, there are perhaps 700 varieties, “from soft cheeses like the fresh and delicate goat’s milk Perroche to full-on, funky washed-rinds like the aptly named Renegade Monk”. The fact that this is so is largely due to two generations of inventive British cheesemakers and sellers including the late Mary Holbrook, creator of the lovely Tymsboro, which Palmer describes as “a salty-peppery ash-covered pyramid” made from goat’s milk. Palmer’s sensuous descriptions made me ravenous for cheese, from buttery lancashires to nutty Lincolnshire Poacher, a relatively recent British invention that occasionally tastes of pineapple. “Nobody knows why,” he writes.The return of good British cheese is a surprise, given that for most of the 20th century, it looked as much of a dying commodity as shoes hand-stitched by cobblers. Palmer notes that in 1939 there were 333 British farms producing cheddar. By 1974, 300 of these farms had been lost and many of those that remained produced cheddars lacking the old character. The problems of British cheese were partly the problems of late 20th century food in general. Too much of it was mass-produced, globalised and dull. Factory cheese started being produced in the UK in the 1870s, but increasingly it could not compete with cheap imports from Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. By 1929, New Zealand cheddar was “fourpence a pound cheaper than its British farmhouse equivalent”. In the 1930s, most British dairies switched from cheese production to liquid milk, which, strangely, gave bigger profits than butter or cheese. In 1933 the Milk Marketing Board was founded, whose mission was to stabilise the milk price rather than to protect cheese.British cheese took a further hit during the second world war. Food historians sometimes note that in terms of pure nutrition, the British never ate as well on average as they did under wartime rationing, when the Ministry of Food ensured an adequate diet for all. True, but rationing was a disaster for cheese. Under the cheese ration, most civilians had an ounce per person (with an extra 3 oz if you were vegetarian). This favoured block cheeses that could be easily cut into tiny cubes, and militated against anything too creamy or crumbly. Government-approved cheeses during the war included cheddar, cheshire, dunlop, lancashire, leicester and derby, but in reality, whichever cheese you asked for, what you got was a chunk of nondescript mousetrap, and you were grateful for it. This legacy of mediocre cheese continued long after the war had ended. As Palmer writes: “By pruning cheese varieties and blurring the distinctions between them, the war not only wiped out some of our cheese but changed the very nature of those that survived.”For decades after the war, British cheese had a very low reputation compared with that of France or Italy. This only started to change during the period that Palmer calls “the great cheese renaissance of the 1980s”. In 1976, in a “rat-infested derelict bit of Covent Garden called Neal’s Yard”, entrepreneur Nicholas Saunders opened a warehouse selling wholefoods. After a few years, he added a cheese shop, which was managed by Randolph Hodgson. At first, Hodgson found he didn’t have much to sell, so he set off on a quest through Britain and Ireland, tracking down anyone who was still making farmhouse cheeses and encouraging others to start.Almost all of the great cheeses of modern Britain have some connection with Randolph Hodgson and Neal’s Yard Dairy. One of Palmer’s favourites is Gorwydd Caerphilly, whose grey rind ripens the cheese “from the outside in, breaking its firm dry texture down into something almost liquid and softening the bright citric acidity of the young cheese into a rich, cabbage creaminess”. This cheese – so much more pleasing than a factory Caerphilly – was the creation of Todd Trethowan in the 1990s. Trethowan was planning to start a degree in archaeology when he happened to pass Neal’s Yard Dairy and had what Palmer calls a “cheese epiphany”. This book – which would make a fine Christmas present, along with a wedge of Sparkenhoe red leicester – is full of such cheese epiphanies. A critic might argue that in paying so much attention to artisans, Palmer is glossing over the fact that the average cheese-eater in Britain is still eating dull block cheddars. But I was cheered by his passion. In this world of grief and ision, it is heartwarming to be reminded that not everything is getting worse. These days, they are even making good cheeses in Suffolk: the mushroomy baron bigod, made near Bungay. “Unlike the old Suffolk bang,” Palmer observes, “this is not a cheese you could sharpen knives on.”• A Cheesemonger’s History of the British Isles by Ned Palmer is published by Profile (RRP £16.99) To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

As temperatures continue to rise, smaller rural communities are becoming unsustainable, while the logistics of feeding and watering the growing city population has come to dominate the economic agenda. Steven is a PR spokesman for the corporation in charge of supplying an unnamed city with potable water. Previous attempts to augment the overstretched supply – an overground pipeline, an armoured freight train – have become the focus of terrorist activity, with raiding parties from the countryside violently advancing the demands of those who live beyond the urban centres. A new plan is hatched: an iceberg is to be towed from the Arctic and brought to an “ice dock” where its abundance of pure drinking water can be tapped and distributed. It is hoped that the iceberg will be largely immune from attacks by vigilantes and climate protestors. Moreover, meltwater from the berg – stillicide – can be utilised to irrigate agricultural land throughout the duration of its passage.The plan is controversial. Construction of the gigantic ice dock will necessitate bulldozing hundreds of homes, destroying established neighbourhoods and communities in the process. Meanwhile, unbeknown to the planners, a scientific discovery relating to the ecosystems in the path of the berg may bring the development of the dock to a standstill.The genesis of Stillicide was unusual. In an afterword, Jones explains how the idea for the book had been growing, though it was a commission from Radio 4 that finally brought the project to life. He was challenged to create a sequence of 12 short stories, each requiring exactly 15 minutes of air time, with the series to be broadcast in its entirety before print publication. “Being for radio,” he writes, “with listeners not having the chance to turn back a page, the world and its characters had to have an immediacy and be clear on first hearing.”Jones is famous for the economy of his texts – his short story “The Edge of the Shoal”, which won the BBC national short story award in 2017, was actually a ruthlessly abridged version of his short novel Cove – and it’s clear from the results that the strict parameters of the brief have acted more as stimulus than restriction. Reading Stillicide before listening to the audio version, I was surprised by how different the two experiences turned out to be. In its written form, Stillicide has a terse, minimalist quality that is at least partly down to how the text is presented on the page. Short paragraphs and generous line spacing encouraged me to read the novel as a series of prose poems. The radical distillation of language, the sense that every word has been inidually chosen, results in a blunt perfection that heightens this effect. Narrative exists, but it is secondary to form. On first encounter at least, the pleasures Stillicide offers appear to be more aesthetic than dramatic.Meanwhile, the men charged with towing the iceberg – “the calf” – are likened to whale-hunters, hard-handed heroes, yet the diminishing boundaries of their reality are brought shockingly home to us when we learn that the crew of this latter-day Pequod have never tasted fish. As Jones details the care the mariners lavish on their deteriorating hardware, we read his words as a warning of new mass extinctions:The pieces lay like artefacts, the crew’s care of them akin to the careful homage of archaeologists. They scraped away corrosion and the salt, with affection close to love.Treated the motors as things that were amongst the last of their kind.While mouthing corporate platitudes by day, executive Steven spends his evenings watching DVDs of old nature programmes, a tension he sees reflected in the ominous tap-tapping of a chaffinch’s beak against his office window, a troublesome, repetitive sound that threatens to disrupt an important press conference. The journalist pushing hardest for answers is Colin, who we learn is the husband of Ruth, the nurse who has been caring for Branner’s sick wife. “Colin must be hard to live with,” Steven observes, but as Ruth wonders if she is ready to abandon her marriage for still greater uncertainty, we are pressed in turn to ask ourselves if being hard to live with is the price that must be paid for asking difficult questions. The dense web of connections between characters and stories leaves no doubt that Stillicide is best described as a novel rather than a collection of shorter fictions. That these connections can be quantified not only in terms of character relationships but as a cumulative statement of theme lends further weight to this argument.In his book-length essay on literature and climate change The Great Derangement, the novelist Amitav Ghosh argues that for mainstream literary writers, the subject and details of climate catastrophe still appear too vast and too improbable to be used as subject matter by novelists accustomed to dealing with everyday reality. The result, he suggests, is that this most urgent of contemporary subject matter is being exiled to the borderlands of genre fiction, while literary fiction is in danger of becoming irrelevant. Unsurprisingly, he has been criticised for so summarily dismissing science fiction as an unworthy or less significant vehicle for the description, discussion and analysis of important subjects. The climate has been a central concern in sci-fi for more than five decades. Taking Ghosh’s argument on its own terms, though, I am sure he would agree that the tide is beginning to turn. If climate chaos was previously too big a subject for “serious” writers to wrestle with, it is now too big to ignore. Any writer who does not seek to address it in some way runs the risk of joining the dinosaurs in their oblivion.With recent novels from Megan Hunter, Jenni Fagan, Richard Powers, Ben Smith, John Lanchester and Ghosh himself working hard to imagine the effects of climate crisis at both the global and the personal level, Stillicide can be added to the growing roster of powerful and urgent meditations on the future. As a tract of written language, it is close to perfect. As a repository for ideas, it is imaginative and far reaching. As a story of and for our times, it is very human, and deadly serious.• Nina Allan’s The Dollmaker is published by Riverrun. Stillicide is published by Granta (£12).

It’s a hidden world full of danger, magic, excitement, night shifts and nights out. Out in the dark, landscapes that were familiar to us in daylight are transformed. The darkness smothers both the beautiful and the bad, and it reminds us of the things we can never know, and never conquer – although we try our best with coffee and blue screens.I was drawn to write about the landscape after dark because I love being outside beneath the night sky. When the rest of the world is asleep and you are alone in nature, there is nothing so peaceful and restorative as gazing up at the stars – and the thrill of being out in the dark keeps me on my toes. Looking up at the night sky has helped me to find a wider perspective on my place in the universe. Not only are my everyday problems diminished when I remember how small we all are, but I am filled with wonder at how lucky I am that the right atoms came together to form my mind and body.The night has captured our imaginations since the beginning of time. After all, half our lifetimes are spent in darkness, and when our instincts kick in and our more primitive senses are heightened, who knows what weird and wonderful stories will unearth themselves? As Byron wrote in his poem Manfred, at night we can learn “the language of another world”.Here are 10 of my favourite books featuring the night:1. An Astronomer’s Tale: A Bricklayer’s Guide to the Galaxy by Gary FildesEarlier this year, I visited Kielder Observatory in Northumberland and picked up this book written by the man who founded it. Not only is it a beautiful nature memoir about understanding the night sky, it’s also a wonderful reminder of how anyone, no matter where life has taken them, can follow their dreams and aspirations. Fildes left school at 16 and entered the building trade, but after years of harbouring a secret love for astronomy, he finally followed his passion and helped to bring thousands of other people closer to the stars.2. The Midnight Folk by John MasefieldA childhood classic filled with everything the young imagination might conjure up from the shadows: witches, wizards, talking animals, seafaring adventures and rides on flying broomsticks. Young Kay Harker sets out on a midnight quest to recover a long-lost treasure stolen from his great-grandfather, but soon finds himself up against dark and terrible forces and must rely on his friends, the “midnight folk”, to help him. Often frightening but always enchanting, this was always a favourite story of mine to read by lamplight.3. Acquainted with the Night: Excursions Through the World After Dark by Christopher DewdneyThe Canadian author takes his reader on a beautifully woven journey through our relationship with the night, from science and art to storytelling and anthropology, examining our love for sunsets, fireworks, astronomy, nightclubs, sleep and bedtime stories. His writing is engaging and poetic, speckled with comedic anecdotes and rich in detail. Part fact, part philosophy, this is the perfect read for sleepless nights.4. Tristessa by Jack KerouacThis noisy and humid novella-memoir takes place on the Mexican streets, as the protagonist travels through the night to visit the morphine-racked sex worker he believes he has fallen in love with. An uncomfortable tale, ebbing and flowing between the pain of its impoverished characters and the cyclical numbing of their addictions.5. The Night is Darkening Round Me by Emily BrontëA poem to share with friends on a dark and stormy night, this is one of the most evocative and menacing verses from my favourite Brontë sister. Its descriptions of the wild, untameable weather and the unexplained tension captured in the repeated phrase “I will not, cannot go” pull the reader right back into the shadowy corners of Wuthering Heights.6. The Taxidermist’s Daughter by Kate MosseMosse is the master of eerie historical thrillers and this 2014 novel, based around a remote stretch of the Sussex coast, does not disappoint. Opening as residents gather in a misty churchyard to celebrate St Mark’s Eve – a night when the ghosts of those fated to die in the coming year are said to appear –it plunges into a shadowy world of murder, secrets and amnesia. Delightfully disturbing, impossible to put down.7. Nightwalk by Chris YatesFor those drawn to nature writing, Nightwalk is a magical journey into the author’s intimate relationship with the outdoors. His love of walking and angling have given him a gift for deep observation, noticing every slight shift in his surroundings, every bird call and blossoming flower. Yates watches the countryside landscape change as night falls, inviting readers to slow down and take notice of the world.8. A Midsummer Night’s Dream by William Shakespeare“Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.” The original midnight adventure, Shakespeare’s most enchanting comedy follows four Athenian lovers as they are manipulated by a herd of forest fairies intent on causing mischief. While Samuel Pepys called it “the most insipid, ridiculous play” he ever saw, it remains one of Shakespeare’s best-known and most adored comedies.9. At Night: A Journey Round Britain from Dusk Till Dawn by Dixe WillsA travel guide with a difference, Wills approaches nightwalking from a more practical angle, exploring how familiar landscapes change during darkness. He meanders gently between geography and history, and offers his readers useful tips on walking safely in the dark, enjoying what our nocturnal landscapes have to offer.10. The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light by Paul BogardLight pollution may not get as much attention as the climate crisis and air pollution, but it is a growing environmental problem, researched meticulously by Bogard.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.We begin with a “surprise” for CCCubbon, who has become “quite addicted” to The House on the Strand by Daphne du Maurier:At first I was scoffing mentally at the notion that a drug could induce time travel to the 14th century but the story has drawn me in and I find myself addicted to the addiction of Richard who cannot resist returning again and again, getting irritated by his wife’s presence, caught between two worlds. It is noteworthy the way du Maurier tells of how the landscape changes over the centuries, how Richard searches to marry up the places of then and his time – and yes, there is a map.“Just finished Leonard and Hungry Paul by Ronan Hession,” says pinstripedflower, and “loved it”:It’s a rather gentle tale of two friends who haven’t quite fully embraced life, and how they get on without being ‘complete’. I have to say I probably most resonated with Hungry Paul’s takedown of his sister Grace on her need for ‘busyness’ and it made me think about my always being rushing around! Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice, uncomplicated but well-written novel.Kerr was a wonderful writer. She had such a clear voice when she wrote! The artist’s eye is there and she doesn’t lose the perspective of the young girl even as she writes as an older, more mature, more experienced woman.Tim O’Brien’s magnificent The Things They Carried has worked its dark magic on Larts:I thought it was frightening, awesome, touching, shocking. It’s a well-written book - is it fiction? Memoir? Well he keeps telling you that it’s often made up but then tells you that it’s true. None of that bothered me particularly. The whole thing struck me as authentic and honest. Wonderful, if difficult, read.Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez has been convincing for daveportivo:I thought it was a fascinating read and a powerful argument for collecting sex-disaggregated data. I knew much of it already, but the medical research chapter was particularly disturbing. I’d read about the effects of the “average human” in terms of pollution before (there are some tragic stories), but hadn’t really considered the implications of that concept (or a lack of rigorous, multi-phase testing on women) in terms of basic medicine and diagnosis ... But in many ways that proves her point, even when I was aware of a problem in the way we measured something, I didn’t think: “Hang on, I wonder if they are doing this in other areas”.JayZed has been making good progress through Proust’s In Search of Lost Time:I finished In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower last week (Penguin translation by James Grieve). I mentioned before that there were parts of Swann’s Way that I found a bit of a slog (and other parts that I loved). About half-way through volume two, however - on the way to Balbec - I suddenly got it. I understand now why people become immersed in and obsessed with Proust, and I’m looking forward to the rest of it.“James Meek’s To Calais, In Ordinary Time is easily my new novel of 2019,” writes allworthy:A group of archers are making for Calais when the Plague hits. It’s 1348. The novel is written in three styles or registers from people of different stations. It’s not quite as wide as The Canterbury Tales but you get a good mix and Meek deftly inserts strong women into the story. It’s real achievement is the language. The book is easy to read but contains many words, phrases and cadences which feel right for the period and which gives the book great energy and a realism. The characters are complex, even the minor ones. They are often wrestling with an upside down world that they struggle to understand. It’s not all doom and gloom either. Some of it is very funny but a moving, well-paced novel that never slacks. Really recommended.Finally, interwar has been reading The Red House Mystery by AA Milne:A thoroughly silly plot, characters all sound the same (except the comically rendered servants), dead guy lying there and everyone standing around coolly discussing the pros and cons of whether their country-house host did it. Yes, it’s just what the doctor ordered (or should have)! Puts the brain on hold for an hour or two, escaping far from Brexit.Sounds like a useful one!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Board member Sir Michael Snyder will serve as interim chairman until a replacement is found.It marks the latest change to Hill’s tenure as chairman after a turbulent period for the bank, which is still awaiting the outcome of an investigation by City regulators after it misclassified £900m worth of loans as less risky than they actually were. Bank originally announced in July that the 73-year-old would step down as chairman but stay on the board as a non-executive director and president. However, at the start of this month the plan had changed, with  adding that Hill would step down from the board entirely by the end of the year.The latest change comes as the bank tries to repair its reputation after a string of controversies, including the payment of £25m in fees to the architecture firm owned by Hill’s wife, Shirley.John Cronin, a financials analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said: “While we don’t know what is behind the early departure, we have heard the murmurs around regulatory discontent in the context of Hill remaining on the board. Of course, Hill may have simply just had enough, too.”Snyder said: “The board thanks Vernon for his vision, which inspired and created  Bank 10 years ago. He leaves a lasting legacy of creating fans through exceptional customer service and has revolutionised British banking.”Hill said he wished  Bank customers, shareholders and colleagues “every success for the next stage of the journey. As always, the best is yet to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e8606fb48181f319e4082c825ab7053afc2115/0_0_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6961c7cdda321fa2e86888eba535176a","title":"tell us south african cities after apartheid","story":"We would like to speak to people about their views and experiences of city life in the country since the demise of the brutal political regimeThis year marks 25 years since the end of apartheid in South Africa, a brutal political system that enforced the segregation of people of different races.From 1948 to 1994 the ision was formalised by law, ensuring the minority white population controlled wealth and power, while black people were oppressed and stripped of basic rights, such as the right to vote.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially.

And the British women we spoke to are indulging themselves, guilt-freeI’d be lying if I said I’d been looking forward to my 40s. Before the big birthday rolled around, I’d defined this decade as old. Boring. I was wrong. Speaking to other fortysomething women, I realised this is the time to forget about guilty pleasures. Here, we’re celebrating all out, straight-up pleasures. Some are everyday. Some are extravagant. They share one important theme: experiences over things equals enjoyment.‘I treated myself to a bike that’s turned me superhuman’Sarah Emslie, 41, osteopath, EdinburghI caught myself saying “I’m having a midlife crisis” to the guy in the bike shop and I kicked myself, because it’s nonsense. If I want to blow four figures on a super-fast aerodynamic time trial bike then I should celebrate. We don’t need to apologise for having fun. Racing head down, number on my back, I feel superhuman. I love how clear my head feels speeding downhill at 60km an hour. My favourite moments are when my wife, Laura, rides ahead of me, so I can take in the view of the mountains with her zooming down. I’m faster over the course than I was last year. It’s exhilarating to be 41 and still get better at your sport. I don’t feel my age. I don’t feel anything except that I’m me.‘I just enjoy being in a creative space’Helena Smith, 41, psychologist, KentThere are many hoops to jump through to get out of the house, especially because I’m a single mum, but my Tuesday life drawing class is worth it. I don’t give two monkeys about being good at sketching I just enjoy being in a creative space where I don’t think about work or bills or the stress of being a working mum because I’m so in the moment. Taking time out forces you into a different mindset. It’s been years since I did anything creative like this, because when you have babies it’s nearly impossible to do anything for yourself. During the two-hour class, time disappears completely. It’s my ultimate indulgence, because it’s purely for myself – nobody else’s benefit.‘Reading all morning is my ultimate indulgence’Minhe Currier, 41, stay-at-home mum, SurreyIf I don’t get time to myself I just don’t function. It’s not even an indulgence, it’s a sanity issue. As a married mother of a six-year-old, I automatically put myself last. But after the school drop-off, I open a book and read. In my 20s and 30s all I did was work. I was a broker in the city, starting work at 6.30am, leaving at 7pm and coming home without the emotional energy to read anything at all. Now I’m really into non-fiction because I’ve discovered life is much stranger than anything an author can make up. Recently I’ve read Harriet Harman’s autobiography, A Woman’s Work, which I think is good enough to rival Michelle Obama’s Becoming. Harman was a big childcare campaigner and reinforced the idea that parents are better people when they have their own lives. I couldn’t agree more.‘I get excited about an early night’Rhiannon Evans, 48, surveyor, CardiffI’m happier after a big sleep, and my skin looks happier, too. I get excited about an early night. I crave sleep and dream about my duvet during a rough day at work. I’m in bed by 10pm and I fall asleep quickly, often while I’m reading, but perimenopausal hormonal mayhem means I’m often awake for two or three hours in the middle of the night. It doesn’t help that my kids, aged 18 and 21, keep totally different hours to mine. At the weekend I might sleep until 10am, which is bliss.‘I never thought high street pasta could feel so extravagant’Zohreh Ghaffari, 48, radiographer, LondonIs it boring that my ultimate indulgence is eating pasta alle vongole until I can’t breathe? Add a nice glass of wine and finish up with chocolate and I’m a happy woman. In my 20s I ate out a lot without really thinking about it. Now going out for dinner is a mission: we need to book a babysitter and there are lots of stars that have to align workwise, because my husband and I both do shifts in different hospitals. But because we eat out so rarely, it feels special when we do. Sometimes we even have a random day off midweek together, so we treat ourselves and go for pasta on the high street while the kids are at school. That feels like a real indulgence.Beauty is ageless.

Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral.”Consequently, no official representative of the Irish state was present at the burial of one of the century’s most significant cultural figures, and probably the most celebrated Irishman in history.Joyce’s relationship with his country was famously vexed. He left for good in his early 20s, driven out – “exiled”, as he himself liked to put it – by its spiritual impoverishment, its relentless oppression of those who tried to live and think beyond its parochial norms. Ulysses was never officially banned in Ireland for the simple reason that no bookseller was reckless enough to attempt getting it through customs. And yet for all the world-encircling magnitude of his genius, the universality of his themes, it was Ireland, and specifically Dublin, that remained the inexhaustible subject of his work. When he was asked toward the end of his life whether he would ever consider returning to the place, he answered: “Have I ever left it?”This question of return has lately been raised again, in the form of two Dublin city councillors, Dermot Lacey and Paddy McCartan, proposing a motion to seek the repatriation of his remains in time for the centenary of Ulysses’s publication in 2022. There is no evidence that Joyce himself ever expressed a desire to be buried in the country of his birth, but the councillors cited an apparent effort by his widow Nora in the late 1940s to have his remains returned to Dublin. “The benefit of this,” said Lacey, “is that you’re honouring someone’s last wishes.” But of course the honouring of Nora’s wishes – evidence for which, as the Joyce scholar Sam Slote pointed out in the , is not all that compelling – was hardly the true motivation for digging up her husband’s earthly remains and sticking them on the next Ryanair flight out of Zurich. “I’m not going to be cynical about bones,” Lacey said, before immediately going on to be quite cynical about bones: “I think it’s something Joycean lovers would appreciate. I don’t want to calculate something like this in shillings and pence but I don’t think it would do any harm. I think it would do some good.”There is a distasteful irony to this whole idea. Joyce could neither live nor work in the Ireland of his time – a suffocating theocracy that foreclosed every possibility of freedom: intellectual, sexual and existential. “Do you know what Ireland is?” as Stephen Dedalus puts it in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. “Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.” A century after the publication of Ulysses, capitalism – which has since supplanted Catholicism as Ireland’s officially professed faith – has come to see the value of Joyce and his work, and he has taken his place in the pantheon of Irish brands, as a sort of Arthur Guinness of literary modernism. The old sow wants the bones of her farrow back, because there is still some meat to gnaw on.Not that it seems particularly likely to happen. As Fritz Senn, director of the Zurich James Joyce Foundation, has pointed out, in the absence of any compelling evidence that this is what Joyce would have wanted, there is little incentive for the Swiss to give up his body: “I think there would certainly be some resistance because, after all, Joyce is one of the major tourist attractions that people come to see. Many people go to his grave so there would be an issue.” It’s also worth remembering that any plan to remove the body from the family plot would first have to be approved by the writer’s grandson, Stephen Joyce, a literary executor so legendarily unaccommodating that he once informed a performance artist that he’d infringed on copyright by merely memorising passages of Finnegans Wake.If Dublin city council were to somehow pass the resolution, and then somehow convince the Irish government to seek the repatriation of Joyce’s body, and if the Irish government in turn were to somehow convince the Swiss authorities to relinquish it from their soil, what would happen? What would happen, we can be confident, is that Joyce’s body would become one more tourist trap in a city that is essentially a gigantic tax loophole filled with tourists in expensive raingear and homeless bodies in sleeping bags. What would happen is that it would become one more way for Dublin to present itself as a literary mecca, while in reality transitioning into a cultural wasteland where creative spaces are closing down to make way for more hotels, where artists can’t afford to live due to a brutal and unregulated rental market – one presided over by a ruling party, Fine Gael, many of whose parliamentary members are also landlords.What would happen is that Joyce’s bones would bring more tourists to a city that, were he alive today, he would still have to leave because he couldn’t afford to live in it. And what would furthermore happen, I may as well warn you now, is that I would personally dig up those bones in the dead of night, haul them into eternity along Sandymount strand, and heave them into the snot-green, scrotum-tightening sea.The fact, in any case, is that to remove those bones from Zurich and put them in the ground beneath Dublin would be in some fundamental sense a meaningless gesture. Joyce’s presence in this city is already radically overdetermined, overbearing in its intimacy and immanence. If you care about his actual work, as opposed to the subsidiary revenue streams it might represent, Dublin is entirely inseparable from Joyce. I am writing this, for instance, in the National Library, where one of the chapters of Ulysses is set, and although I work here almost every day, it’s impossible for me to walk through the front entrance, where Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom passed each other without acknowledgment on the afternoon of 16 June 1904, and not experience a small ectoplasmic frisson.The same is true of countless places I, as a Dubliner, encounter every day, such as the large Georgian house on the quays I walk by with my son on the way to school, a house that is abandoned and crumbling like so many other buildings in a city in the throes of a housing crisis, and which happens to be where the short story The Dead is set.Even in his absence, there is no getting away from Joyce. The whole city of Dublin is haunted by his words. Let Zurich keep his bones.• Mark O’Connell is a writer based in Dublin and author of To Be a Machine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e526ca987fe0b8417d563e7b52d82a4f998731/4_0_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5b4e90864f04179dc5df3a6b75d97d4","title":"netflix most watched tv shows films figures","story":"The streaming giant has unveiled the most watched shows and films of the past year, suggesting what its future might look likeOne of the many disruptive qualities of so-called industry disruptor Netflix has been a lack of transparency over viewing figures. Unlike their competitors (the main networks and cable channels), they have never been held to the same standard, never judged by ratings, choosing to keep themselves separate, much to the rest of the industry’s frustration. But over time, a shift has taken place.Slowly but surely, the streaming goliath has started to share viewing data, usually as a brag and only when it shows them in a positive light, but with each shred of information we have started to see the bigger picture. Just last week, we were handed their most revealing dump to date, the 10 most popular original films and shows over the last 12 months, complete with figures for each. While we’re still starved of the bottom end of the list, and disappointingly yet tellingly, any box office data for their theatrical releases, we can start to see what is and isn’t working for the platform.If one were to examine the top 10 theatrically released films over the last year, the upper end, if not the entire list, would be dominated by franchises, sequels and ones that don’t necessarily rely on the names involved. But on Netflix, an underdeveloped alternative to the multiplex, the biggest films more closely resemble the box office hits of the late 80s and early 90s when star appeal was prioritised over spectacle, a period that saw Rain Man, Fatal Attraction, Ghost and Three Men and a Baby win big.The top three most-watched Netflix originals of the last 12 months are Bird Box (80 million viewers), Murder Mystery (73 million) and Triple Frontier (52 million), all broad, crowd-pleasing films sold almost exclusively on stars Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler and Ben Affleck, all of whom are actors who broke out in the 90s boasting fanbases that have mostly stayed loyal ever since. The mixture of recognisable casts, substantial budgets and experienced directors meant that they all looked like actual theatrical releases, too, making their drops feel like mini-events to viewers who might not have been anticipating their release.Inevitably, and ironically, the films that seemed to stand against the ongoing production line of predictable sequels being churned out by the wider industry are all now being envisioned as franchise-starters by those behind them. Murder Mystery 2 has been given the official green light, a follow-up to the Bird Box novel was announced earlier this year, leading many to speculate about an adaptation, while Triple Frontier director JC Chandor has expressed muted interest in a quadruple. Next year also sees sequels to the previous year’s hits The Kissing Booth and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.By far, the platform’s biggest TV drop of the year is Stranger Things 3 (64 million viewers), an inevitable result given the frenzy surrounding the series since it began in 2016, but while it’s easy to equate its success to that of a big-screen sequel, especially given both its genre and how it’s been marketed, what’s most interesting is that it’s one of only two shows on the list that isn’t a first season. There’s no sign of Netflix staples like Orange is the New Black, Glow, Bojack Horseman, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, House of Cards, Black Mirror, The Crown, 13 Reasons Why and Mindhunter, and instead viewers have flocked to new shows like The Umbrella Academy (45 million viewers), You (40 million) and Sex Education (32 million), all also notably aimed at a younger audience.It’s a sign that either original shows tend to lose viewers with each season or that Netflix has been algorithmically tweaking its output to fall more closely in line with its most impassioned younger viewers. With all new shows on the list coming back for a second season, it will be interesting to see what next year’s results highlight.Importantly, the lists provided don’t include content acquired by Netflix from elsewhere which would inevitably mean that much-loved sitcoms like Friends and The Office would make an appearance. The success of both (Netflix extended the Friends deal for one final year for $100m before it was snapped up by HBO Max starting 2020) led many to believe that the practice of bingeing was mostly employed by those seeking lighter, snappier fare. But the appearance of two tough, issues-led dramas on Netflix’s TV list suggest that this might not always be the case.In a short amount of time, Unbelievable (32 million viewers) and When They See Us (25 million) have shown there’s a big audience for fact-based shows dealing with difficult, timely topics. Unbelievable, a combination of a dogged crime procedural and a docudrama, focused on rape and how it can be mishandled by authorities while When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s Emmy-winning Central Park Five miniseries, dealt with race and how it too often leads to false imprisonment, and both were eagerly consumed by viewers and critics. Expect a major awards push for both in time for the Golden Globes as well as further green lights for equally tough-minded dramas.Genres that have long been cast aside by Hollywood have been carefully and cleverly resuscitated by Netflix for a while now with notable successes, such as 2018’s “Summer of Love” which saw a string of smash-hit romcoms, including Set It Up, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before and The Kissing Booth (all of which Netflix has been happy to brag about). In comparison, before Crazy Rich Asians last year, the industry hadn’t seen a $100m romcom hit since 2011’s Just Go With It.The latest top 10 is filled with similar examples with teen movieromcom crossovers The Perfect Date (48 million viewers) and Tall Girl (41 million), psycho-thriller Secret Obsession (40 million), romcom Always Be My Maybe (32 million) and chick flick Otherhood (29 million) all scoring well. Apart from Otherhood, the films mentioned aren’t really star-led but their appeal is more about a tried-and-tested-and-forgotten-about formula being brought back to life. The success of “cheerfully trashy” thriller Secret Obsession, from longtime Hallmark and Lifetime channel director Peter Sullivan, is perhaps the most concerning given its rote plot and flat TV movie direction. It’s a cheap quickie that would usually be chucked on to cable but its large viewership on Netflix will lead to more of the same, a grubby inevitability and looking ahead at their schedule, there are similarly low-rent options in the coming months.The list of most-watched films, from Bird Box down to Fyre (20 million viewers) sees a gap of 60 million viewers, meaning that while some films hit big, there’s a great many that lag far, far behind. This doesn’t make them flops per se but it does mean that genuine phenomena are hard to find. The list also shows that while Netflix has put a great deal of funding into both their awards push and their splashy partnerships with respected auteurs, audiences are less invested in the outcome than they are.The most conspicuous absence is Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, the platform’s most critically acclaimed and awarded film to date. Netflix might have been proud to flaunt its reviews, nominations and eventual wins but they have yet to release any solid data about either its streaming viewership or its limited run at the box office. There’s also no love for the Coen brothers and their anthology western The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Dan Gilroy’s Sundance-premiering art world horror Velvet Buzzsaw, the long-awaited Orson Welles drama The Other Side of the Wind, Paul Greengrass’s grim docudrama 22 July or Steven Soderbergh’s High Flying Bird. Of course, these films would have been unlikely to make the top 10 most-watched films at the cinema, too, but the film list offers a picture of a far less demanding viewer than the TV list and show’s a great discrepancy in the films that Netflix chooses to promote over what viewers choose to watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face.

We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

The islands had previously been seen on satellite images but the expedition was the first to see them.It also said it had also confirmed the existence of an island that had been previously mapped as a peninsula of Hall Island, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, west of Novaya Zemlya.Moiseyev said names for the new islands were “upcoming”.“Of course each island will receive a name but first you have to lay out the case for it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/825208b1496562ef1386bd1ad9ddefac471eaa6f/559_242_4369_2622/master/4369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07bc2509950f1b4f55ff79cefb7cd653","title":"specieswatch polecat returns to england","story":"Gamekeepers nearly wiped out species but it has spread back from its last refuge in WalesThe chances of spotting a polecat (Mustela putorius) – except the ones that have been run over – is pretty slim, the ranger said cheerily, but that is how we know they are back.And back they are – resident in vast swaths of England, returning to places where they were exterminated. Overzealous gamekeepers had nearly wiped out the polecat by 1915, but it has spread back from its last refuge in the west of Wales across England as far as East Anglia.Most of them are purebred, but in some places they have interbred with their domesticated relative, the ferret Mustela putorius furo. The Furo, meaning thief in Latin, is essentially the same creature but tamed roughly 2,500 years ago to hunt rabbits. If escapees mate with polecats the resultant offspring, although slightly lighter in colour, go native and generally thrive.Polecats, with distinctive black and white furry “bandit” faces, generally eat rabbits and are small enough to live and breed in disused rabbit burrows. In autumn they move closer to humans in farms and outbuildings and eat rats, which are more plentiful, so this is the best time of year to see one.In spring they will eat frogs, eggs and birds, which is why gamekeepers killed them, but now they are protected.

Now the Allerton Oak in Liverpool has been voted England’s tree of the year and Britain’s representative for a European-wide competition.The Liverpool tree’s hefty boughs are propped up with metal poles and the oak carries many centuries’ worth of stories.Since Allerton lacked a courthouse in medieval times, it is believed to have been the meeting place for the local court. A large crack down its side was supposedly created by the Lottie Sleigh, a ship carrying 11 tonnes of gunpowder which exploded while moored in the Mersey nearby in 1864.During the second world war, leaves from the tree were sent with letters to local soldiers on the frontline to remind them of home.Scotland and Northern Ireland have also chosen their tree of the year in the competition, with the Woodland Trust deciding that the Allerton Oak will now represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year contest, which begins in February 2020.The Scottish winner is an elm that survived Dutch elm disease but stood forgotten beside Glen Affric until discovered by Forest and Land Scotland and Trees for Life staff. This survivor of an ancient forest is now surrounded by new, younger trees as part of a project to restore native woodland to the Highlands.In Northern Ireland, voters chose a sessile oak tree at the entrance to Rostrevor Oakwood, County Down, one of Ireland’s last remaining ancient woodlands. The tree became known as the “invisible tree” because it was omitted from a survey supporting the construction of an apartment block within a few metres of its roots and branches. After support around the world, the tree was reprieved.Adam Cormack, head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust, said: “The Allerton Oak is a spectacular example of a city tree. Trees are an important part of the urban landscape helping to make our towns and cities better places to live. We are keen to increase understanding of their value and promote their protection. We are currently working with partners to help increase tree cover in the city and make Liverpool a greener place to live.”The winning tree will be awarded £1,000 – supported by players of People’s Postcode Lottery – to help protect it.Liverpool city council and Mersey Forest are investing £80,000 in a new propping mechanism for the Allerton Oak, with built-in flexibility to adapt as the tree continues to grow.“We are determined to make sure it stays healthy for as long as possible,” said Cllr Laura Robertson-Collins, cabinet member for environment and sustainability at Liverpool county council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31720bb43d94ffd7049e98263ebba040e15e1cd/0_0_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82b8eec9d955ef155fce8802db9231f8","title":"pumpkin waste uk halloween lanterns","story":"More than 8m squashes likely to be binned after annual lantern carving, study showsBritons are expected to generate record levels of food waste over Halloween this year.More than 8m pumpkins – equivalent to more than 18,000 tonnes of edible pumpkin flesh – will be heading for the bin because the majority of consumers will not eat it.Meanwhile, the UK’s first commercially brewed beer made from pumpkin flesh that would otherwise go to waste will go on sale at the end of November.Toast Ale, the social enterprise that three years ago launched a beer made from surplus bread, will brew the Belgian-style pumpkin dubbel using squashes collected by volunteers from local farms.Tessa Tricks, the head of food programmes at Hubbub, said: “It’s all too easy for people to forget that Halloween pumpkins are still food.

You might spot it on celebrities, on the cover of a magazine or on the bus. And then, suddenly it registers on the radar of wider culture. In the case of the headband, that was last week in parliament when Carrie Symonds, the partner of the prime minister, sat watching proceedings wearing a large, flocked, navy headband.As the Daily Mail wrote the next day – in a feature asking: ‘Are you posh enough for a powerband?’ – there is something decidedly upper-crust about this item. Other fans include: the sisters with names worthy of Waugh Lady Alice and Violet Manners Princess Beatrice, who wore one to a garden party, and Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s ex, who wore one to Beatrice’s wedding.I do struggle to think of my mum – more inclined to the artistic school of dressing – doing the same. It’s fair to say that I am not posh enough for the powerband. I have never knowingly been to a garden party. I haven’t even watched The Crown. I certainly don’t dress like a Sloane Ranger – I’m more likely to be found in a band T-shirt or hoody, and I am rarely out of trainers. I am, however, always interested in finding out how the other half live (or, at least, do their hair). So I try the headband out.I wear a straw version to dinner at my sister’s house (this passes largely without comment, although my boyfriend says it looks “a bit Handmaid’s Tale”) and to hang out with friends on Saturday. One of them says it looks like I have borrowed sunglasses from Star Trek’s Geordi La Forge and pushed them up to my forehead, which is novel. Commuting home on a drizzly Monday, I wear a green one, decorated with punk studs. Standing in a packed carriage, I think a woman nudges her friend and laughs at my headband. I don’t blame her.My takeaways? The reactions are fine – but it takes a while to get used to having a huge great thing on your head. To use an entirely non-posh word, it just feels a bit extra, like wearing a crown when you’re doing the weekly shop. Going to work in a striped number with pearls, I end up tying my hair back and matching my clothes to the headband. Off comes my usual sweatshirt and gold hoops, replaced with an old Chloé blouse with wide sleeves and some diamante cross earrings. Pretty posh. For me, anyway.As well as Princess Beatrice and friends, powerbands can be traced to the catwalk. For springsummer 2019, every model at Prada wore padded designs, from pink satin to black and beaded. Brands including Erdem, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and Simone Rocha have had them, too. The more ornate ones have also been linked to the Renaissance being so hot right now – a portrait of Anne Boleyn from circa 1533 has the then-queen wearing a very 2019 pearl headband. Accessorize is selling a simple, black style called the Boleyn for £9.Headbands have history before 1533. Fashion historian Tony Glenville says they can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans, and from medieval times, head-dresses – similar to Boleyn’s – were used by women to tie long hair back. Until the 20th century, women did not commonly cut their hair, he says.The alice band we know today originates in John Tenniel’s illustrations for 1871’s Through the Looking Glass, in which Alice wears a ribbon to tie her hair back. Glenville says this image means the headband has always been seen as a “simple and youthful style” and in the 1920s they were worn, across the forehead, by the Bright Young Things. You could argue the Sloanes, attending parties such as the Rose Ball in their headbands and puffball dresses, were picking up on the history of those hedonistic rich kids. “The original idea is about simplicity and practicality,” says Glenville. “The ribbon holding long, luxuriant hair back.”While there have been other headband moments since the 1980s (see Blair Waldorf in Gossip Girl), York says the trend is properly back now because – in common with most fashion revivals – enough time has passed between revivals, and we’re able to see the charm of those 80s references. This is certainly true for Emma Elwick-Bates, contributing editor of American Vogue, and headband aficionado. “To me, the style recalls young Diana and Fergie, at ease and joyful,” she says. “And my perennial fashion favourite - Princess Caroline.”Whether it is through sheer laziness or a way to be more Teigen, I’m starting to think the headband could be reclaimed beyond those who appear in Debrett’s. I’m going to give it a try this party season. If you see me on the tube, try not to laugh.

Now, a new documentary charts the movement’s charismatic leaders, conflicts and futureIn 1968, Aksel Lampmann was a teenager growing up in Soviet Estonia. That summer, he went to an international camp, where he met students from Czechoslovakia and began listening to the Beatles. He didn’t understand the lyrics (“No one spoke English back then”), but loved the sound. “We had no clue what they were singing about. What a strange vibration!”He learned guitar and grew his hair. By 1969, Lampmann had become a full-blown Soviet hippy. The iron curtain made a road trip to the US impossible, so he hitchhiked from his home in the Baltics to Crimea. “Our lives were more colourful, more alive,” he says. “Other people didn’t have the same encounters or emotions.”Lampmann is one of the stars of Soviet Hippies, a film by the Estonian writer and director Terje Toomistu about a lost period in Soviet history. The documentary explores a subculture that was inspired by the west yet distinctly homegrown – existing in a society shaped by communism and watched over by the KGB.“In the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair or wearing strange clothes,” Toomistu explains. The USSR, by contrast, wanted complete control of its citizens’ lives: how people worked, dressed, or even danced. Anyone who rejected the Homo sovieticus model could be in “big trouble”, including having their hair forcibly cut.The Soviet hippy movement emerged in Moscow and Leningrad around 1966 and 1967, in the early years of Leonid Brezhnev’s rule. The first red hippies were the sons or daughters of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura – well-behaved kids from elite families. They had access to music from the capitalist world and to jeans. By the early 70s, the movement had grown sufficiently big and unruly to alarm the authorities – though it probably only ever numbered a few thousand, Toomistu says. The secret police began tailing the long-haired to school. In June 1971, the hippies were given permission to demonstrate against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in Moscow.This was a trap. The KGB rounded up and arrested demonstrators, with the goal of wiping out hippy culture. Some demonstrators were sent to psychiatric facilities and injected with insulin others dispatched to the army and camps near the Chinese border. The film re-creates this grim clampdown and uses surveillance photos found in KGB archives in Lithuania.According to Lampmann, harassment by the police and KGB was common. “One of my close friends ended up in prison,” he says. Hippies were persecuted under criminal rather than political law. They could find themselves sharing a cell with gangsters and murderers. To avoid arrest, Lampmann always kept his documents in perfect order.By the late 70s, the hippies had developed a counterculture, with Russian slang and a music scene. There was what Toomistu calls “analogue Facebook” – notebooks listing names and numbers of contacts across the USSR, used by travellers seeking somewhere to crash for the night. This network is gloriously animated in the film, which features psychedelic drawings and cartoons.The underground subculture connected people from different social backgrounds, the writer Vladimir Wiedemann says. It included hippies, dissidents, mystics, religious activists and human-rights campaigners. Some embraced spiritualism, others yoga and veganism. All rejected the Soviet regime and thus played a role in its eventual demise.Wiedemann was exposed to rock’n’roll culture via Finnish TV and Radio Luxembourg, which he could pick up from his home in Estonia. “The iron curtain wasn’t that strong,” he says. Now based in London, Wiedemann wrote a book on hippies, Forbidden Union, which is currently running as a play, How Estonian Hippies Brought Down the Soviet Union!, on the Moscow stage...The film features interviews with Wiedemann and other survivors from the “hairy underground”, as Toomistu puts it. Most are men, still espousing hippy ideas and with beards and hair still flowing but grey. There are fewer Soviet female hippies, Toomistu says many left the scene to have children. The movement’s charismatic leaders are largely dead, often from drink and drugs.These were widely available under Marxism. Forbidden from travelling physically beyond the eastern bloc, Soviet hippies instead became “psychonauts”, Toomistu says. They consumed weed from central Asia and the Caucasus, opium and poppy tea. Some drank Sopals, a Soviet cleaning detergent containing ether.Toomistu grew up in post-Soviet Estonia. She was interested in the hippy scene as a teenager, and was a fan of Jim Morrison. She spent half a year in Russia as a student, and wrote a thesis about memory culture. The idea for the film came together after her own road trip in South America, she says. She is currently completing an anthropology PhD. There is little archive material on communist-era hippies, whom the Soviet press ignored, Toomistu says, erasing them from history. She retrieved a box of video footage of festivals and gatherings from a hippy who had to leave Russia in a hurry. In 2017, several of her subjects went to a hippy reunion held every year at Moscow’s Tsaritsyno Park, to mark the 1971 demo busted by the KGB.The reunion is poignant. Russia’s war in Ukraine and its 2014 annexation of Crimea ided opinion. Some hippies support Vladimir Putin and his idea of a great spiritual Russia. Others take a more traditional pacifist view that all war is bad. The film ends with Putin’s police breaking up the party. It is a metaphor for state-hippy relations, now and then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcff8ee96e2a6e3c18ce3e50529bd80c91438471/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=234448294487b4f439944451f58d7b87","title":"chelsea champions league kante barkley ajax","story":"Frank Lampard believes Chelsea are a long way from matching the long-term success of Ajax’s academy and has said that he is not getting carried away with his young side’s performances this season.Ajax have a proud tradition of producing homegrown talents and the Dutch champions came within a whisker of reaching last season’s Champions League final, only to lose to Tottenham  in the last four. However Erik ten Hag’s side have bounced back after selling Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt in the summer and sit top of Group H before hosting Chelsea on Wednesday evening.Lampard has given youth a chance since taking over at Stamford Bridge, with Tammy Abraham, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Reece James, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori all catching the eye, but he feels Chelsea’s academy is not yet at the same level as Ajax’s.“We’ve got a long way to go to claim the similarities,” Chelsea’s manager said. “We shouldn’t get carried away with ourselves. It’s great we have a good feeling at the club, in terms of the young players that have come through. I think it’s long-deserved recognition for the academy itself and those players. But we are at a place that is steeped in history of creating great teams with groups of young players over the years. We have a long way to go to do that. But in the short term I’m certainly happy.”This promises to be a tough test for Chelsea, who are second in the group after earning three points from their first two games. Ross Barkley, Andreas Christensen, N’Golo Kanté and Antonio Rüdiger are out against the group leaders, who opened their European campaign with thumping wins over Valencia and Lille. But Lampard wants his young side to push themselves.“I aim to give them confidence because I believe in them,” he said. “What Ajax did last year was incredible. With us, I think you see my belief in them because even though everyone says we had a transfer ban and it’s the only option I have, that’s not true.“The young players have shown it. But we mustn’t get carried away with thinking that’s the end of the story. It’s a nice story until now but success in the longer term is what we have to work for. I keep saying it is just the beginning of the road but I feel like by having belief in them, they can feel that back. I also need to be strong in driving them to get better all the time.”Like Ajax, Chelsea have installed former players in important positions in recent years. Petr Cech was appointed as the club’s technical and performance adviser in the summer, Ashley Cole is coaching the under-15s and Carlo Cudicini, Tore André Flo, Claude Makelele and Paulo Ferreira hold influential roles. “With ex-players, you would hope there is a feeling for the club, a feeling from the fans who like to see players who care about their careers at the club,” Lampard said. “You can try and continue with an idea or an ethos, which is where teams like Ajax and Bayern Munich get it so right because it doesn’t change on short-term results. It tends to stay for the longer term.“Also with ex-players, it is a great thing for the club but they should be there on merit. I should be manager of this club on merit because I want to work hard, be successful and help improve the club. So should everybody. Petr Cech has a work ethic to be the best he can be every day.”Tomori revealed that Gareth Southgate and the Football Association have offered England’s players counselling following last week’s racist abuse in Bulgaria. “Obviously it was a difficult experience,” the centre-back said. “What we wanted to do was just play our football, to win the game. That’s what we did. When stuff like that happens you have to try and block it out even though it is so blatant.Tomori added that English football must also tackle its racism problem after the alleged abuse at Haringey Borough’s FA Cup tie against Yeovil Town last Saturday. “Racism, wherever it is, is not a laughing matter and is something that needs to be kicked out of the game,” he said. “It’s a gradual process. It’s not going to stop overnight and we just have to keep on drumming it into people that it’s not acceptable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba0ecd9426e3240097aa15d6165265ca5e7fc58/0_156_3851_2311/master/3851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d33a48669bfcf12cdb32a0bce113d37","title":"manchester city atalanta champions league match report","story":"On a night of firsts for Manchester City’s English contingent, they could savour one more than the other. Raheem Sterling’s maiden Champions League hat-trick rendered the first red card of Phil Foden’s career a footnote.If that was attributable to the folly of youth, Sterling epitomises Pep Guardiola’s perpetual quest for exponential improvement and this was another milestone in his development. His treble was all the more notable as it came in 11 minutes, and he had also set up both of Sergio Agüero’s five-minute double. On the night, as in his time at City, it was quite a turnaround Sterling instigated. Having trailed, City overwhelmed Atalanta to take a five-point lead at the summit of Group C. The knockout stages beckon.“I am so satisfied with the result,” said Guardiola. Whenever he praises an opponent’s attacking gameplan while previewing a match, it can be the prelude to a thrashing. So it proved. “I really admire them for their bravery,” the City manager said, but bravery backfired for the Italian side.Serie A’s top scorers had a goal disallowed, with Remo Freuler denied, could easily have added others and were enterprising and entertaining. But City capitalised as Atalanta attempted to man-mark across the pitch. They had no inidual capable of halting Sterling. They remain pointless.“Raheem was brilliant,” Guardiola added. “He is an incredible player for us.” It was high praise, but his perfectionism is rubbing off on his players. “Perfect night,” said Sterling. “But I should have had four.” He rued the moment when Foden released him and he rolled a shot past the far post.Three sufficed to make him only the eighth Englishman to score a Champions League hat-trick. All of the other seven are strikers by trade and Sterling’s treble came from the left flank, each showing his capacity to cut infield. His first goal, and City’s third, stemmed from a powerful surge from Kevin De Bruyne, followed by a sharp turn that left Rafael Toloi on his backside. The Belgian found Foden whose selflessness was apparent as he squared the ball to Sterling, in a better position, to lift his shot into the roof of the net.A precise low finish followed after Ilkay Gündogan, with similar accuracy, provided a defence-splitting pass while he ensured he departed with the match ball by ghosting in to apply the finishing touch to Riyad Mahrez’s cross. “All the credit is for him,” added Guardiola, deflecting the praise for the transformation of a man who had never scored more than 12 goals in a season before they linked up and who now has 16 for this campaign already. “I think he has the desire to be better. He helps us a lot.”He aided, abetted and assisted Agüero. It was the Argentinian’s destiny to be eclipsed by Sterling but, if City were relieved when he escaped unhurt from a car crash last week, he inflicted some damage on Atalanta, who led for six minutes before, in a mirror image of Sterling’s first goal, Agüero applied a deft touch to the winger’s chipped cross. His second came from the penalty spot after Andrea Masiello felled Sterling.The Ukrainian was fouled for Foden’s first yellow card. His second seemed inevitable when he tugged back Marten de Roon, although Guardiola, who gave the teenager a consolatory pat on the back on his way off, confronted the fourth official. “He told me not to talk too much because he wanted to show me the yellow card,” said the City manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d167b396e8b017339157556900d01e9552a29546/0_176_4751_2850/master/4751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c1d9a0305ca72f714a615f5defc43f","title":"womens football prize money world cup","story":"The announcement that viewing figures for the Women’s World Cup hit 1.12 billion is hugely impressive and raises vital questions about how we measure the success of the women’s game versus the men’s.If you put to one side the massive exception of the USA women’s national team generating more income than their male counterparts yet being paid less (which hints at this being more ideological than financial), then the argument against equal World Cup prize money and funding is that, generally, the men’s game generates more income that the women’s. Except this is never quantified. Because sponsorship rights and broadcast rights (which make up the majority of money generated) for both the men’s and women’s premier competitions are bundled and sold together, it is impossible.The assumption is that these big-money deals are sold overwhelmingly on the basis of the men’s World Cup. But this can only ever be an assumption when rights are bundled together. (Uefa, meanwhile, has unbundled the rights for its women’s competitions – the European Championship and Champions League.)So, in the absence of unbundled rights, why do we not use that figure to determine the women’s share? Why do we instead get another token “doubling” of the prize pot or investments when the numbers are so low?The announcement that the women’s prize pot will double again to $60m for the 2023 tournament makes for an impressive headline in isolation, evidence that Fifa does indeed care, until you read that the men’s is increasing by $10m more than that, to $440m, in time for the Qatar World Cup. When Megan Rapinoe was asked ahead of before the USA’s semi-final against England whether she felt, as a campaigner, they were making a material difference given the mid-tournament raft of Fifa announcements – among them a further doubling of the prize fund and a $500m investment in women’s football (since upped to $1bn) – she was dismissive.“Double it now and use that number to double it or quadruple it for the next time,” she said. “I think that is what I mean when we talk about whether we feel respected. If you really care about game in the same way, why are you letting the gap grow? We’re not asking for $450m for lots of different reasons – the men’s game is far more advanced financially than the women’s game.”While there was undoubtedly a huge amount of respect for Rapinoe, this also prompted the view that she was simply being radical for the sake of it, that laying into Fifa as big money was being poured in was misjudged or misplaced.Except in the above context, her comments are transformed. If anything, they are relatively conservative and very considered. “You don’t get to have an incredible business running it on a budget of a dollar more than last year,” she said. “You have to bet on the future of the women’s game and it has proved World Cup after World Cup, year after year that we are worthy of investment and the quality on field is there and we need the business step to be in line with the steps we are making in performing on the field.”• The Manchester City defender Aoife Mannion will “shortly undergo surgery” after rupturing her cruciate ligament in the Champions League draw with Atlético Madrid.

Last year’s inaugural winner, Ada Hegerberg, is also on the list of nominees having scored a 16-minute hat-trick in the Champions League final.• The first ever Lisbon derby between Benfica and Sporting was played at the Estádio do Sport Lisbon on 19 October with more than 12,000 in attendance. Benfica took the lead through the Brazilian forward Nycole Raysla before two from her compatriot Darlene put the result beyond doubt.• NWSL Shield winners North Carolina Courage ensured a place in the Championship play-off final for the third consecutive season with a 4-1 defeat of Reign FC in extra time. A Heather O’Reilly penalty in the 88th minute looked to have given NCC victory before an injury-time strike from Ifeoma Onumonu sent the game to extra time. A goal from Debinha, a Lauren Barnes own goal and one from the former Chelsea player Crystal Dunn sealed the win for NCC.

At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Now, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/572328c93d566ce8b4dac540ecba402ae3a4e1f0/0_172_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f2a98f721594f97c76fc4c0a680513b","title":"men are like muffins my leadership tips to help guys win in the workplace","story":"It is a wonderful time to be an ambitious woman. The corporate world really is your oyster as long as you lean in and learn the rules of interacting with men in the workplace. These rules can, admittedly, be a little intricate to navigate – particularly when you are burdened with a smaller and more pancake-like brain than a man – but some forward-thinking companies are giving their female employees a helping hand.Take EY, for example, a multinational accountancy firm which describes its purpose as “building a better working world”. According to a report by HuffPo, EY offered a women’s leadership training last year, called Power-Presence-Purpose, which offered up empowering pearls of wisdom like this:– Women’s brains absorb information in the same way pancakes absorb syrup, making it hard for them to focus. Meanwhile, male brains are like waffles information collects neatly in each little waffle square.– Women should not directly confront men in meetings or talk to a man face-to-face, because men find it threatening.– Women should ensure they have a “good haircut, manicured nails, well-cut attire that complements your body type”.– While women should “signal fitness and wellness” they shouldn’t flaunt their body. “Sexuality scrambles the mind (for men and women).”– Women should phrase their thoughts and ideas as questions.– Women often ramble, so should make sure to speak briefly.The training presentation, I regret to inform you, did not take that last piece of advice to heart and consists of 55 pages of this nonsense.After HuffPo first broke the story, EY defended the program and dug up a few alumni who said they had found it extremely helpful. It seems that EY has changed tack, however. The company now says it has cancelled the training, which was delivered by a (woman-run) firm called Marsha Clark \u0026amp Associates. “There is no question that elements of the program included offensive content that is inconsistent with our core beliefs,” EY said in a statement on Monday.I think there two key takeaways to be had from this sorry corporate saga. The first is that sexism is alive and well. The second is that you can apparently stick any old BS into a powerpoint deck, give it an alliterative name, and sell it to a multinational accountancy firm for a healthy profit.Bearing that in mind I would like to seize this moment with my manicured nails and present a free sample of my new corporate training program:– Men are like muffins: nobody really wants more than one in a meeting. If there are multiple men in a meeting you should appoint one person the Token Speaking Man and ensure he keeps his contribution as succinct and clear as possible.– Men are like cinna-buns: they can have a very overpowering scent. Keep your cologne professional so as not to distract the ladies.– Men are like croissants: they can be very flaky. Keep your thoughts on track by writing them down in neat little lists.– Men’s brains are like bagels: missing a core component. They are just not cut out for leadership in the same way women are. Nevertheless, with enough training they can occasionally make an important contribution.– Men are like bialys: depressed in the middle. Make an effort to smile more and help brighten up the workplace.Like I said, this is just a free sample. I’ve got 55 more pages of this.EY, I am waiting for your call. I cannot wait to put our pancake and waffle brains together and build a batter for a better working world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/552c5fcf186be7a30f474985a67f99f71c022609/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d192e08d9a3455fe0b021fb1634a2f","title":"life goals how three women made their money work","story":"Putting money aside can be difficult. But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

For this reason I took out a Domestic \u0026amp General £5.99 a month “peace of mind” care plan when I bought the machine in 2016, which allows me a replacement like for like should anything go wrong. Four weeks ago my machine stopped working. D\u0026ampG said it would be three days before they could send a technician. When the technician arrived, he had to order a spare part and promised to call when it was in. Having heard nothing for five days, I called D\u0026ampG. It said that the replacement time frame was 28 days, which was not flagged up when the key facts of the policy were explained. After six more days of chasing, there was still no news and no updates. It was only when I called two weeks after the technician’s visit that I was told the machine had been written off and would be replaced. I stressed that the noise level was a critical issue and was assured the replacement would be equivalent to my old one. However, the new machine was 10 times louder than my old one. The sound pierces my son’s ears and his reaction is devastating but D\u0026ampG explained that decibels were not a key specification. I have had to pay £48 for a third party to collect the machine and will have to shop for a new one. I have paid in excess of £220 into the care plan and spent three weeks using launderettes and friends’ machines. Had I not had a care plan, I would have had a new machine immediately and probably for not much more money.As you’ve discovered, extended warranties are rarely worth the money. The manufacturer’s warranty should cover appliances for the first couple of years – often more – and the Consumer Rights Act allows up to six years to complain about a fault, although you have to prove it’s a manufacturing defect if it’s more than six months after purchase.If appliances last longer than that you could end up paying more in the monthly premiums than the cost of a new machine. And if you have to wait up to 28 days for a repair or a replacement, it may be quicker to sort a problem yourself.Your experience is dismaying on several counts – the long wait, the waste of a machine that had been deemed reparable and the indifference when the replacement did not meet your needs.Predictably, D\u0026ampG softened when the Observer put your case. It removed the unsatisfactory machine for free, gave you a cash sum to buy a replacement and added an extra sum in goodwill. “We are sorry the customer had a bad experience with us,” it says. “Delivering quality customer service is our priority, so any complaint is disappointing and we work hard to resolve these incidents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/280a1b745cf150da700650603c7fb81becef9d40/0_341_5118_3071/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e983b3ac7da80fef13544b66f0d5a17","title":"sao paulo underground music scene brazil","story":"Brazil has long had countercultural music, but Jair Bolsonaro’s repressive presidency has made this community more determined than ever‘When he got stabbed I just thought, we’re fucked. If he is alive, there is nothing we can do.” Brazilian journalist Amauri Gonzo is recalling the moment that he knew Jair Bolsonaro would be elected his country’s president. The stabbing of the far-right candidate seemed to confirm the picture of Brazil that Bolsonaro had been painting to voters: lawless, unsafe, and in need of a leader unafraid to meet violence with violence. Just two months later, in protest at five years dogged by economic crisis, corruption scandals and political turmoil, Brazil chose the openly racist, misogynistic, homophobic and anti-environmentalist former paratrooper as its leader. The underground musical community, which had come out in force against the extreme right candidate, was stunned. “It all went quiet,” says Gonzo, “like, ‘Oh, what do we do now?’”Brazilian music might bring to mind the warm breeze of bossa nova, or a sound humid with the sweat of carnival, but a group of loosely connected São Paulo artists are making much harsher music to reflect, and resist, the Bolsonaro era, underlining values of community and artistic freedom.It’s worth mentioning first that the country’s long history of resistance through music runs directly parallel to its past as a colony, a slave state and as a military dictatorship. The 1964–85 dictatorship, for which Bolsonaro has openly professed his admiration, inspired Brazil’s most famous moment of artistic resistance: the Tropicália movement. Encompassing poetry, art and music, it subversively critiqued the regime. The movement was already effectively over when in 1969 its musical leaders, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, were arrested as part of a crackdown and sent into a three-year exile in London. Less well known, but perhaps just as influential, are the hardcore and post-punk movements that swirled up in the early 80s as the dictatorship teetered and fell. In recent years, Brazil’s vibrant and vast hip-hop community has found a new voice on issues of race and police brutality.Brazil’s history of cultural resistance dates back beyond the past century, as Mariano, percussionist in the cacophonous São Paulo trio Deafkids, explains. Samba, he says, was initially a way for his African ancestors to access the heritage from which they had been violently cut off. For him, the roots of Brazil’s current trauma date back just as far, to conquest, genocide and slavery. “The way we deal with what identity is and what culture is, is really fragmented. This becomes more explicit in moments of polarisation, like right now.”Deafkids’ 2019 LP, Metaprogramação, is a hallucinatory blur of noise that addresses “the politics of who we are, in terms of what composes us”, says Mariano. But they prefer to avoid the kind of political anachronisms associated with punk. “We are not interested in cultivating nihilism … in cultivating crisis,” he says, explaining that Deafkids’ philosophy is not rooted in opposition. “We are more interested in trying to think of other ways to say yes, of other things and other practices to embrace and other ideas to spread.”What this means in practice, he says, is bringing back communality to music. He has in mind everything from cumbia and classical Indian music to the radical techno of Underground Resistance, music that has been “shunned as music which is not deep because it is related to the body”. Deafkids, he says, want to engage with the body from the neck down, to make music that is “more transcendental in a less rational way”.The body itself is at the centre of post-punk group Rakta’s work. “Being a woman and occupying a space in the Brazilian music scene is a social and political act in and of itself,” says member Carla Boregas. Her bandmate Paula Rebellato says that, in Brazil, a woman is murdered every two hours. For them, Bolsonaro, who opposes gender equality and once taunted a female congresswoman that she was “unworthy of rape”, is an open manifestation of Brazil’s history of misogyny. “It has never been easy to live in Brazil,” Carla adds poignantly, but now, because of Bolsanaro and others like him, people no longer bother to hide their misogyny, racism, homophobia “and a host of other prejudices”.Inspired by the attitude and the activism of the Brazilian hardcore scene of the late 80s and 90s, Rakta refract their experiences of growing up in Latin America’s largest city through droning psychedelia. Boregas says that lyrics by 90s hardcore group Invasores de Cerebros (“São Paulo dangerous city … São Paulo violent city”) spoke directly to her experiences growing up in a working-class neighbourhood bordered by favelas. Their São Paulo is a city of enormous disparities, a “chaotic and vibrating” place where you can experience the “complete raw and hard duality of being a human in a capitalist society”, she says.Similarly to Deafkids, with whom they toured this spring, unity is at the heart of their music, present in the “strong, intimidating, powerful and mysterious” energy that comes from the female “egregore” (collective mind) of the group. Through their performances, which they describe as “temporary zones of reality that we co-create” with the audience, Rakta want to create islands of sound in a sea of oppression, where “people end up finding a little comfort, and feel hosted and integrated”, says Boregas. The band may not be able to heal literal wounds, but they still have the artistic freedom with which they can ease some of the anxiety and distress that comes with daily life in Brazil under Bolsonaro.The idea of community as a small breach in an oppressive reality is also at the centre of São Paulo’s underground club culture. Around 2010, a new kind of party began to appear: self-organised, self-financed and inclusive. Often held in the street or in occupied buildings, they represent what Amauri Gonzo calls the proud Brazilian countercultural tradition of the street as both a party and a political venue.“Everything was born out of a necessity to fill a blank spot in the culture of our city,” says Amanda Mussi, a techno DJ and promoter. But successive mayoral administrations, seeking to clean up the downtown area, have made this harder, applying increasingly arcane and demanding safety regulations that these promoters say are not even met by São Paulo’s more upmarket, commercial clubs. Beyond that, there’s endemic systemic corruption. “It’s not just one permit,” says Mussi. “It’s a permit of a permit of a permit. You have to pay several charges and taxes, but this all goes to someone’s pocket – it’s not real.” The agenda of the mayor’s office is clear for these collectives and activists: a revitalised downtown is simply too potentially profitable to be left in the hands of community organisers. Now that the inner city has life again, it won’t be long before the cycle of gentrification reaches its next step, with property developers moving in to create manicured, homogenised neighbourhoods.That image is perhaps best represented by Teto Preto, the electronic act fronted by Diaz and sinewy performance artist Loïc Koutana, who merge playfulness with activism: the video to their signature track Gasolina features Koutana writhing and weaving along a line of police in riot gear, a call to ignite the fuel in the hearts and minds of their fellow Brazilians. Both Teto Preto and Mamba Negra are a re-vindication of the spirit of Brazil’s week-long Carnaval street parties: joyously anarchic and riotously flamboyant. But it’s about more than just dancing. Diaz says the aim was not only to create a safe space where women and LGBTQ people could party, but also where they can become protagonists who are recognised for their work. “We pay our taxes, we want to be respected, we want the right to work and the means to do it,” she says. The ambition behind that statement burns especially brightly in a place where homophobia was criminalised only in May this year, a move swiftly denounced as “completely wrong” by Bolsonaro.That Mamba Negra and the Bolsonaro presidency were both born out of the smoke and anger of the 2013 protests demonstrates the ision at the heart of Brazil. Out of that moment, each saw an opportunity: one side detected the potential for a Brazil that celebrates the country’s ersity, and the other side saw the opportunity to use the chaos to drag the country back to its colonial isions. That they still haven’t escaped that colonial legacy is an issue that haunts these artists and their peers. But, equally, what keeps them from succumbing to the inevitability of that outcome is also written into Brazil’s history: their faith in the unbreakable bonds of autonomous communities. No leader, no government and no dictatorship has ever been able to fully suppress a culture that grows irrepressibly between the cracks.A couple of weeks after we speak, Mariano emails me to try to explain what kind of music inspires Deafkids to keep writing. His description could serve as a manifesto for Brazil’s artists today: “Music which carries ‘the heat’, a pulsating will to live, even when at its saddest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12031bb0ac340bb6b15ad0e26d500370dcd128dc/0_301_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b652da5e87f12ff265af6c0750b503","title":"how did a town in west virginia become the opioid capital of the us","story":"Chris McGreal reports on the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county, West Virginia, the opioid capital of America.

I commend her for her work in representing that area and the obvious friendship that exists between her and all the people she represents she is a great MP”.Seven of the group subsequently published a statement saying that, while they had reservations about the deal, they believed it was right to allow it to continue to be debated, to “give us a proper chance to get a Labour Brexit”.Only five Labour MPs then supported the government’s programme motion, which would have resulted in the deal being rushed through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday.Labour frontbenchers discussed the timing of a potential election at a testy shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with Corbyn loyalists Laura Pidcock and Dan Carden calling for the party to back an early poll.Carden told colleagues the “referendum first” approach espoused by some of his colleagues was a fantasy, which wouldn’t win a majority in parliament and which the government would anyway refuse to implement.The deputy leader, Tom Watson, has argued publicly that it would be better for Labour to settle the issue of Brexit in a referendum and then contest a general election on a wider set of issues.At the shadow cabinet meeting, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, clashed with colleagues over Labour’s stance on a second referendum.According to those present, Corbyn opened the meeting by reminding shadow cabinet members not to stray from Labour’s agreed policies in media appearances.Starmer then suggested existing Labour policy meant the party must support any amendment to the government’s withdrawal agreement bill calling for a referendum on Johnson’s Brexit deal, and then campaign for remain.But in a debate that became fractious at times, according to two people present, Starmer faced a backlash from colleagues including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett.One witness said Lavery accused Starmer of “ramming this policy down my throat for 18 months”.In the shadow cabinet discussions about whether Labour would campaign for remain against Johnson’s deal, Lavery and Trickett pointed to the motion passed at last month’s Labour conference in Brighton, which said: “The party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government.”Party members backed the motion after Corbyn made clear he wanted the decision about its referendum stance to be taken after a Labour government came to power.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, also expressed concerns about supporting a compromise similar to the Kyle-Wilson amendment.The Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson previously suggested they could support Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement if it was subjected to a confirmatory referendum. But Corbyn said he would “caution” MPs against being willing to accept that quid pro quo.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.Abbott said last month: “I don’t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it’s got a referendum attached. That’s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.“Either it’s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market – or it’s not. The referendum is not an end in itself. Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don’t support it.”Starmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said publicly they would like to campaign for remain.But Trickett said earlier this month that he did not support the idea of a referendum that would pitch Johnson’s deal against remain.“A referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave – and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c680473cce3aa9af98c8915d22a249fd57208c/220_256_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d4056bdc177c2d837b54b68103a1aae","title":"tories hire facebook propaganda pair to run online election campaign","story":"Sean Topham and Ben Guerin have worked on campaigns for Australia’s rightwing coalition and Glencore mining firmTwo political campaigners hired by the Conservatives to run their digital campaign at the next general election previously helped run an enormous Facebook propaganda network.Sean Topham and Ben Guerin have been employed to improve the party’s online operations, following a disastrous 2017 election when the Tories were outgunned by Labour in internet campaigning.This summer, it was revealed how Sir Lynton Crosby’s CTF Partners used Facebook to run a large-scale professional disinformation network on behalf of paying clients including major polluters, the Saudi Arabian government, anti-cycling groups and various foreign political campaigns.Documents seen by the  show that Topham and Guerin, while working as contractors for CTF Partners, had oversight of dozens of these pages which sidestepped Facebook’s rules on transparent political campaigning, reaching tens of millions of people on behalf of paying clients while appearing to be grassroots independent news sources. All parties have previously pointed out that they operated entirely within the law.The new Conservative digital campaigners, both New Zealanders in their 20s, also flew around the world to promote the interests of clients such as Glencore, one of the world’s biggest miners, while concerns – which they strongly denied - were raised about some of their behaviour in the office.The pair’s arrival comes after their success helping Australia’s rightwing coalition unexpectedly win the country’s general election, where they were praised by local media for their understanding of how to fight online campaigns. Purposefully low-quality memes based around popular shows such as Game of Thrones were used in a bid to drive interactions – good or bad – at any cost, on the basis that this would boost the reach of future Facebook posts.“We’d make them really basic and deliberately lame because they’d get shares and lift our reach that made our reach for the harder political messages higher,” an anonymous inidual told the Sydney Morning Herald, dubbing the strategy “boomer memes” as the content appealed to older audiences.In recent days, the Conservatives have begun purposefully posting badly-designed social media material, at one point urging MPs to back a Brexit deal using the often-derided Comic Sans font. The Tories’ political opponents lined up to mock the image, inadvertently sending it viral and ensuring it was seen by a wider audience.The hiring of the two New Zealanders comes as transparency campaigners warned that the UK was still not prepared to regulate online campaigning during the next general election, despite lengthy investigations into the use of Facebook advertising during the 2016 EU referendum.All political parties expect the social network to be a major battleground during the next general election, with one senior No 10 source saying “this will be Carole’s worst nightmare” – a reference to the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who has worked to expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Major parties are expected to dedicate a substantial proportion of their election spending to advertising on Facebook and its sister service Instagram. Iniduals involved in those preparations said they expected the focus to be on using the social network, which on Monday announced a new range of transparency tools for political advertising, as a cost-effective broadcast advertising medium to promote simple messages to voters.Sources suggested there would be less focus on microtargeting of small groups of iniduals, not least because restrictions introduced since the last election on incorporating third party data from the likes of Experian has made this much harder. Instead, campaigns expect to use Facebook’s in-house targeting tools to automatically find audiences which are more receptive to their messages.Topham and Guerin, who cut their teeth in Auckland politics, spent several years working as consultants for longtime Tory strategist Crosby’s CTF Partners lobbying company but are now focused on their own business.The duo are reunited with Isaac Levido, another former protege of Crosby, who worked on the successful Australian campaign and is now in charge of preparations for the Conservatives’ general election campaign.Allies and opponents privately describe Levido as a ruthlessly focused and effective campaigner. However, questions remain over whether he worked with CTF Partners when the business was supporting the party of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, who was subsequently charged in relation to his alleged role in the 1MDB corruption scandal. Razak denies the claims.Levido declined to comment when contacted by the  as to whether he worked on the Malaysian contract but did clarify that he had never worked with Cambridge Analytica.In a separate development, Crosby’s CTF Partners is being investigated for a potential breach of rules by the lobbying regulator relating to staff who did voluntary work for prime minister Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign – claims they strongly deny.Crosby is a long-term ally of Johnson but is reported to have become increasingly detached from day-to-day operations during a power struggle with senior Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings. As a result, he is unlikely to take part in the next election campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa87b7aee770842986ccb2f35278c810b1f2abde/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dacb13f567f3660182b982fea9c58ca","title":"yeah but no but how the papers covered mps refusal to rush through brexit deal","story":"MPs blamed for letting Boris Johnson nudge his deal forward but blocking his self-imposed deadline With the complexity of a Brexit delayed but not denied to cover, Wednesday’s papers worked hard to make sense of Boris Johnson’s latest setback, with Parliament bearing the brunt of the criticism.The Daily  leads with “Brexit is in purgatory” after MPs thwarted Johnson’s “do or die” pledge to leave the EU at the end of October.

The Matt cartoon riffs off the Guy Fawkes gunpowder plot. says MPs blocked Johnson’s timetable for a deal even after he threatened to pull the bill and call for a general election. Johnson will now press EU leaders to avoid a lengthy delay, it says. If you can pull yourself away from the image of Wolf for the “Gladiators: 20 years on” feature, the headline is “Parliament puts brakes on Johnson’s race for Brexit.”The Sun deploys Little Britain’s Vicky Pollard to interpret the two votes on the deal and the timetable, going with the headline: “Yeah but no but …” Nine former Tories voted against the proposed three-day schedule, it says.The Mirror refers to the PM’s Halloween deadline for a straightforward headline: “PM’s Brexit horror”, and says in its intro he doesn’t stand a “ghost of a chance” of leaving the EU on his timetable. It too mentions high that Johnson had threatened to pull the withdrawal bill entirely but instead opted to pause it.The Daily Mail again criticises MPs for scuppering a quick deal, with the headline: “Trust this lot to turn triumph into disaster!” It claims Johnson’s win on the second reading of the bill as a “huge boost” but says the next step is now in the hands of the EU. The Express follows a similar tack after an “evening of high farce in Westminster”, saying MPs have spoiled a historic deal with “yet more dithering”.The i says a Halloween Brexit is in tatters, and points out that MPs have technically supported a Brexit bill for the first time. It also quotes a “No 10 source” as saying an election is the “only way to move on”.The Times gives its splash to a potential breakthrough drug that can slow Alzheimer’s symptoms, with an arms-crossed Johnson in the picture slot. In a slightly muted treatment, it describes the PM as “frustrated” that MPs supported the “landmark” deal but thwarted his deadline.

In mice used to model the disease, the therapy appears to boost the activity of the brain’s immune cells, making them clear the aberrant proteins that build up in Alzheimer’s.Li-Huei Tsai, a neuroscientist who is leading the trial at MIT, told the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago on Tuesday that the therapy improved the survival and health of the animals’ neurons, boosted their connectivity, and dilated blood vessels, all of which may benefit patients. “We would like to see if our approach slows Alzheimer’s disease,” Tsai told the .The patients enrolled on the trial will have cognitive tests every three months to assess their brain function and regular scans to measure their brain activity and the connectivity of neurons across the organ.Tsai told the conference that the light and sound sessions had boosted the amplitude and synchrony of 40Hz brain waves in the trial patients, but that it would take a year to gather data on whether the sessions helped to keep the disease at bay. The researchers call the exposure “gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli”, or Genus.A further 40 patients are to be recruited for a second trial that will examine directly whether the light and sound waves reduce levels of amyloid protein plaques and tau protein tangles – the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease – in the patients’ brains and cerebrospinal fluid.The unusual approach to combating Alzheimer’s draws on the ability of light and sound waves to affect electrical activity in the brain. In a series of papers published since 2016, Tsai and her colleagues have shown that light and sound waves oscillating at 40Hz strengthen waves of the same “gamma” frequency in the brain.In mice, at least, this appears to have multiple effects on cells in the brain, including ramping up the activity of the organ’s immune cells, making them more effective at clearing protein plaques and tangles.“We hope our findings in mice will translate to helping people with Alzheimer’s disease, though it’s certainly too soon to tell and many things that have worked in mice have not worked in people,” Tsai said.James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Brain rhythms and their role in conditions like dementia are still mysterious, but this work begins to outline their impact on different types of brain cells and the mechanisms involved.“It’s very early days, but we look forward to seeing how this area of research develops.”In a separate development, a US company that declared its experimental Alzheimer’s therapy a failure in March has revived the drug after a fresh analysis found that it helped some patients. Biogen said it will ask the US drug regulators to approve aducanumab after it identified a statistically significant slowing in the decline of cognitive ability and basic activities of daily living in a subset of patients on high doses of the drug.Pickett said: “This is hugely exciting news. After the trial being stopped earlier this year because it appeared not to work, further analysis suggests that it does benefit people with dementia in the earliest stages.”“We’re waiting for further data but this could be the first new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease in over 15 years, and as such, has the potential to be a transformative discovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/236b8381a4c81156f1e849f55c27f6991f3d0df3/0_179_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713a632b27c3ed6617e2de8e9855935f","title":"anorexia rate children on the rise study suggests","story":"Rate of eating disorder in preteen children appears to have doubled in past decadeCases of anorexia are on the rise among preteen children in the UK and Ireland, research suggests, with rates having as much as doubled in 10 years.The study, which looked at cases of anorexia diagnosed by psychiatrists in hospitals or specialist clinics, estimates that 3.2 per 100,000 children aged between eight and 12 met criteria for anorexia for the first time in 2015, compared with 1.5 to 2.1 per 100,000 in 2006. Trends for older children could not be examined due to lack to comparable historical data.The research follows reports of a doubling in hospital admissions for eating disorders in the past six years, with the surge driven by an uptick in cases among teenage girls and women in their early 20s. Sarah Byford, a professor of health economics at King’s College London and co-author of the new study, said those potentially vulnerable to developing an eating disorder may be being exposed to risk factors at an earlier age, including pressure to diet or do well at school.Tom Quinn, of the eating disorder charity Beat, also urged further research into the trend, and said health service providers should ensure they were making the most of the available resources.“Since 2016, substantial extra funding has been made available to the NHS in England for investment in specialist eating disorder services for under 18s, but not all commissioners and providers have prioritised these services sufficiently,” he said.To conduct the study, published in the journal BMJ Open, Byford and colleagues asked all child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists based in hospitals, universities or community settings in the UK and Ireland to report the number of anorexia cases they had seen every month from February to September 2015.If a clinician reported a case, they were subsequently asked to fill in a questionnaire to allow the team to gather details of the patient and their diagnosis.Over the eight-month period, 305 cases were reported that met requirements for the study, with the vast majority in girls and people of white ethnicity. To calculate the rate of new cases of anorexia, the team took into account that only half of clinicians responded and others did not complete the questionnaire.The results suggest that among children aged eight to 17 years old, there are 13.7 new cases of anorexia per 100,000 people per year. Among girls the estimate was higher, at 25.7 per 100,000, with the age of diagnosis peaking at 15 years old.The team then focused on eight- to 12-year-olds, finding a marked increase in cases in recent years.Byford said that both the latest figures and earlier estimates probably underestimated the true incidence of anorexia, pointing out that many do not seek help, while older teenagers may go to adult services. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has said that fewer than a quarter of people with eating disorders in the UK receive treatment.Dr Agnes Ayton, chair of the eating disorders faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said “This study shows what psychiatrists have been seeing every day, which is a worrying rise in the number of young people suffering from the most deadly mental illness. The causes are complex, and much more research needs to be done in order to better support those affected. Anecdotally, reasons could include increasing pressures on children in schools, and advertisements encouraging unrealistic ideas of body image.”Quinn also said the figures were probably underestimates, and urged further research into earlier interventions. “Full recovery from an eating disorder is possible and the sooner someone gets the treatment they need, the more likely they are to make a full and sustained recovery,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd109afc67868ae63642c28dafe558a04c2a80f/0_199_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=928b0744f2d8b8afcafe17959a6e94f4","title":"houston astros washington nationals world series game 1 baseball","story":"As one of the finest pitchers in Major League Baseball lost for the first time since 22 May, the fallout lingered from a distasteful off-field episodeYou can play indoors and still be under a cloud.On the field, the Washington Nationals conjured a surprise victory in the first game of the World Series as the aura of invincibility around the Houston Astros’ Gerrit Cole was punctured by the power of Juan Soto, the 20-year-old slugger. But as one of the finest pitchers in Major League Baseball lost for the first time since 22 May, the fallout lingered from a distasteful off-field episode.Sports Illustrated’s Stephanie Apstein reported that after the American League Championship Series-clinching win over the New York Yankees last Saturday that sent the Astros to the World Series, “assistant general manager Brandon Taubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, ‘Thank God we got Osuna! I’m so fucking glad we got Osuna!’ The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.”While a member of the Toronto Blue Jays last year, Roberto Osuna, the Houston closer, allegedly assaulted the mother of his child. Charges were dropped after the woman decided not to testify, but MLB suspended Osuna for 75 games. The Astros, Apstein wrote, saw the opportunity to acquire an asset on the cheap, and in trading for the pitcher without giving up much of value, “used assault as a market inefficiency”.This was spin in the old-fashioned them-against-us genre, a closing of ranks in the clubhouse - but also a very modern and familiar attempt at media manipulation. Gaslighting instead of apologising when accused of misconduct, especially by a woman, deny, smear and yell fake news, because truth is fungible now and victory belongs to the brazen.For all the brilliance and appeal of star players such as Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa, Alex Bregman, and the genial manager, AJ Hinch, the incident has made some wonder if the Astros are auditioning for the role of baseball’s Evil Empire now that the Yankees have endured a decade without reaching the World Series.The episode has left Houston open to accusations that they care little about domestic violence or the truth that this club, painstakingly built for success using cutting-edge data analytics and bold big-money trades, has a culture that marries toxic locker-room banter with boorish arrogance redolent of Silicon Valley’s tech bro excesses.Tuesday’s game, at least, was great fun. Minute Maid Park is among the best of baseball’s boxes drawbacks include those carbuncles at the corners, the Chick-fil-A “fowl poles”, and decisions to keep the roof closed even on days such as Tuesday, when the weather is perfect. But that rarely-retracted roof helps keep the deafening crowd noise pinging around the ballpark. So the sound of silence in the rocking orange madhouse was especially striking when Ryan Zimmerman, the first baseman who has been with the Nationals since they emigrated from Montreal in 2005, launched a 413ft home run off Cole in the second inning.Though the Nationals had a week of rest after their 4-0 National League Championship Series stroll past the St Louis Cardinals, the Astros – winners of the World Series for the first time in 2017 – entered the series as heavy favourites, with Cole’s imperiousness a big factor. He had allowed a solitary run in his past three postseason starts, all wins.Yet on the biggest stage, he stumbled. Though the Astros raced into a 2-0 lead courtesy of Yuli Gurriel’s two-run double off Max Scherzer in the first inning, their lead was erased by the fourth through Zimmerman and then an even bigger solo blast from Soto, up to the train tracks above left field.After overcoming adversity against the Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers in previous rounds to give the capital city its first Fall Classic since 1933, there is a zany quality to these Nationals, a subversive streak that complements their obvious talent. When Adam Eaton drove in a run in the fifth and Soto added a deep two-run double, Washington held a 5-2 lead, reduced in the seventh through a solo Springer home run. Springer, a postseason home run machine, drove in another run in the eighth with a double that almost cleared the right field fence as the Nationals’ bullpen wobbled, but did just enough for a 5-4 win.Houston host Washington again on Wednesday in the best-of-seven series as the Astros try to – as their slogan goes – Take It Back. All things considered, it’s a sentiment that should apply to more than their quest for the World Series trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e37d6f885a54995f331741fb1d4607d0701a3b/0_223_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb38c47f252ef4a28bd2323dd5e5c8bd","title":"paralympic gold medalist marieke vervoort ends her life in belgium","story":"Paralympian Marieke Vervoort said when the day arrived, she had signed the euthanasia papers and was prepared to end her life. That day came on Tuesday in her native Belgium, her death confirmed in a statement from the city of Diest.Vervoort, 40, won gold and silver medals in 2012 at the London Paralympics in wheelchair racing, and two more medals three years ago in Rio de Janeiro.In an interview at the Paralympics in Rio, Vervoort described living with unbroken pain from an incurable, degenerative spinal disease. She talked of sleeping only 10 minutes some nights, described severe pain that caused others to pass out just watching her, and detailed how sport kept her alive.“It’s too hard for my body,” Vervoort said in the 2016 interview. “Each training I’m suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard – to push literally all my fear and everything away.”Vervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. Like training hard, she said it gave her control and put “my own life in my hands”.“I’m really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it’s enough for me, I have those papers,” she said. “If I didn’t have those papers, I think I’d have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.”Vervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.A loyal Labrador named Zenn began staying with her, pawing her when a seizure was about to occur. Zenn also pulled her socks out of the sock drawer, she said, and helped carry groceries home when Vervoort bought too much. “When I’m going to have an epileptic attack, she warns me one hour before,” Vervoort said. “I don’t know how she feels it.”Vervoort said she kept pushing back the day of her death, knowing it could come anytime — as it can for anyone. She said she can be pain-free one minute, and nearly pass out a few minutes later. “You have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments,” she said. “Everybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.”Vervoort called herself a “crazy lady”. She talked of flying in an F-16 fighter jet, riding in a rally car, and she was curating a museum of her life going back to at least 14 when she was diagnosed with her rare illness. She had spikey hair and wanted to be remembered as the lady who was “always laughing, always smiling”.“I feel different about death now than years ago,” Vervoort said. “For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it’s something peaceful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d42efa614782f256cb06636ae65a75d1dc2c82/0_0_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553a649df7a007921a5325f7923d7592","title":"talking horses bha british horseracing authority intelligence manager nicola mcdermott","story":"Nicola McDermott, who has served as intelligence manager at the British Horseracing Authority for just over a year, is to leave her post next month, the  has learned. It is believed she is taking on a similar role in another sport and racing’s ruling body praised her “excellent” contribution during her short spell at High Holborn.Her departure comes at a time when morale is said by some insiders to be low among those charged with protecting the integrity of horse racing, following years of upheaval in personnel and policy. However, the BHA insists that a series of high-profile departures are not linked and serve, if anything, to show that its staff are attractive recruits for other employers.“Nicola has made an excellent contribution to the BHA and brought significant expertise to the role,” a spokesman said. “We will miss her greatly, but wish her all the best in the fantastic new opportunity that has arisen for her.“The BHA has a proven track record of recruiting first-class staff domestically and from racing regulators across the world and utilising the skills of experienced law enforcement professionals to keep our sport clean and fair. That’s why our integrity department is held in such high regard and other sports and regulators sometimes make offers that can’t be refused when they want to hire our staff.”But recent years have brought turmoil to racing’s regulator. Adam Brickell quit as director of integrity in late 2016 when the crisis over the Jim Best rehearing was at its height. Jamie Stier left his post as chief regulatory officer the following year. Brant Dunshea eventually inherited Stier’s role last year, with Tim Naylor reporting to him as integrity director since November.Chris Watts arrived at the BHA in 2017 after years of anti-corruption work in cricket to take up a newly created role as head of integrity assurance, though he is now referred to simply as head of integrity. Part of his brief is to kill off the BHA’s reputation for being slow to process disciplinary cases and the appointment of McDermott was supposed to be a useful step in that direction. Watts said at the time that her role would be “to look at intervention opportunities for prevention and disruption” of rule-breaking activity.It took the BHA two years to appoint a new head of stewarding, a role that was finally filled last month. There is no word yet on a new head of raceday operations, a post which fell vacant in July when Emma Marley left for reasons that were not explained.The theme of staff turnover at the BHA was addressed last week by the trainer Ralph Beckett, who told Thoroughbred Racing Commentary: “In this country, our regulator is failing, and that’s probably because those in charge are executives and they move on after a few years. Whatever we felt about the Jockey Club as a regulator, they had the best interests of the sport at heart because they all owned or bred horses, and we need people in charge again who have vested interests who will ensure the sport thrives.”Responding to Beckett’s point, the BHA spokesman said: “The BHA blends specialist expertise from other fields with a core of staff with many years of experience in racing, as jockeys, in trainers’ yards, as owners and as dedicated racegoers. They’re passionate about the sport and proud of what they do to give racing a sustainable and healthy future.”It’s mostly two-year-olds at Newmarket today but I do like the look of Lady Bowthorpe (4.10) in the one race for older animals. She suffered interference close home when narrowly beaten on her handicap debut behind Magical Rhythms.That looks like good form to me and her action suggested that today’s softer surface would be a real help. William Jarvis’s filly is a half sister to Speak In Colours, who has run well in two soft-ground Group Ones this month, and is available at 9-2.In the opener, Ralph Beckett may continue his storming run with the newcomer Calatrava (1.20), a fairly well-related filly available at 4-1. Her main market rival is Mostly, a Gosden  Dettori production, but that one’s excellent pedigree suggests next summer rather than this autumn.Elegant Erin (5.20) gets to run off a 2lb lower mark than when sixth in a much better race here last month and this softer ground will help. She appeals at 6-1, having been bigger last night.The in-form 7lb claimer Luca Morgan, who has won on all three of his rides in the past fortnight, could get a double at Fontwell, thanks to Reallyaradical (3.15) at 11-4 and Love The Leader (4.20) at 10-11."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46a0918dbb2f80796f894499e92b8449a8922ac2/0_305_6540_3924/master/6540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8f4ac5c3d30f2ef3cd1a0ee1a75200","title":"little baby jesus review arinze kene orange tree theatre","story":"Orange Tree theatre, LondonStandup, storytelling and poetry combine in this brilliant show about an inner-city trio on the verge of adulthoodHere is a play that will be racing through you, making you laugh and think, long after you’ve left the theatre. It is by Arinzé Kene, who penned the smash hit Misty, a searing one-man show that burned with the heat of a live gig. This earlier play is about three inner-city teenagers on the verge of adulthood, each a little scared about who they might become. Like Misty, it is a genre-defying theatrical hybrid – a thrilling combination of performance poetry, standup comedy and good old-fashioned storytelling.The energy levels in Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu’s live-wire production are something else. Before the show begins, the actors chat cheekily with the audience. As the stories unfurl, that easy interaction remains. The actors make eyes at the audience, tease us, even sit on us. With the performers perched on a barely raised tarmac platform – their playground for the night – there’s only the flimsiest of fourth walls. Everything they feel, we feel, too.Fynn-Aiduenu won this year’s JMK award for young directors, and he is clearly a talent with great bravado and heart. He takes Kene’s script as an invitation to play and runs – no, sprints – with it. Any moment that can be animated is, and with gusto. A fight in the playground becomes a Jurassic scrap singing in the shower transforms into a three-way dance-off and a mere walk through the street turns into a performance. It’s brilliant fun and a reminder of just how exposed and overblown everything feels when we are young.The actors work in synchronicity yet with such a sense of freedom. Khai Shaw is our clown for the night, the disruptor of classes who only wants to be heard. Anyebe Godwin has an incredible stillness as mature-beyond-his-years Kehinde, and Rachel Nwokoro is captivating as the hard-as-nails-but-soft-as-butter Joanne. As the religious references roll in, and the huge halo light above Tara Usher’s set tilts suggestively, these teenagers’ lives take on a spiritual glow and grow bigger, infused with meaning and grandeur. It is an extraordinary act of generosity from Kene – and an act of faith."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d2681c5d61b3574063f4c1bf91f2855f033e872/0_118_3374_2025/master/3374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974b368bd065b2b6e77ba825991e4c6","title":"libra facebook zuckerberg delay congress","story":"Mark Zuckerberg will tell Congress on Wednesday he is willing to delay the launch of Facebook’s cryptocurrency venture Libra amid growing pushback from legislators and waning support from companies that initially backed the project.“I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now,” the Facebook CEO wrote in his prepared statement, released ahead of Wednesday’s hearing in Congress over the launch of the digital coin.In the statement, Zuckerberg also argued that Libra would improve millions of people’s access to the banking system and that its development would extend America’s financial leadership.But he said Facebook would not be a part of launching the payments system unless all US regulators approve it, and that the company supports delaying Libra’s launch until US regulatory concerns are addressed.Facebook announced the launch of the payments system in June 2019 and initially set to roll it out publicly in 2020. Though Libra was developed by Facebook, the company said the digital asset would be based in Switzerland and controlled by the Libra Association, a not-for-profit made up of a collective of international companies.The plan received swift blowback from legislators in and outside of the United States and in recent weeks, eight of Libra’s original 28 members have withdrawn from the Libra Association, including payment giants like Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and Visa. Despite these roadblocks, the company is pushing forward with the project.Several companies signed on to the Libra charter in the Libra Association’s first meeting on Tuesday of last week securing their places as initial members of the Libra council. These members include Lyft, Uber, PayU, Spotify and the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase.“The association is eager to pursue its mission of building a better payment network, broadening access to essential financial services, and lowering costs for billions of people who need it the most,” Libra said in a statement following the meeting.As Facebook continues its push, politicians in a number of countries have resisted. The UK and the US have called for hearings to provide more information on the currency and France and Germany issued strong statements in September saying Libra would not be allowed to operate there.Faced with aggressive opposition in North America and Europe, Facebook could still first turn to other emerging markets to establish Libra before launching it elsewhere, said Florian Glatz, a blockchain expert and co-founder of the German firm Fundament. But once it becomes more established, some of the firms that have dropped out may rejoin the venture.Libra is facing resistance not only from government entities but from within the blockchain community itself. Thirty different blockchain companies and not-for-profit organizations have announced plans to create their own alternative to the Libra blockchain that is free from the company’s rule.In his testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Zuckerberg will stress the argument that projects like Libra will strengthen the leadership position of the US.“While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn’t waiting,” he said. “China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America’s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9814d4f9dd5943e526aa600aafe92b59adea6f/0_0_4469_2682/master/4469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3b994b09719d52536da5dacd7974f5","title":"apple watch series 5 review the king of smartwatches","story":"Always-on screen completes the package kicking competitors to the curb and becoming a top reason to buy an iPhoneWhen Apple launched its smartwatch in 2015 to a lukewarm reception, some critics claimed it would never take off like the iPod or iPhone. But sales of the Apple Watch quickly eclipsed every other smartwatch and with wearable technology sales soaring it is expected this year to outsell all of the Swiss watchmakers combined.The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at £399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm’s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so.If you are unfamiliar with Apple’s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn’t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch.The Series 5 builds on last year’s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time.It’s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist.Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up – and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle. The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap – if you haven’t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must – the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I’ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer.It’s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don’t. It’s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you’ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool.The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I’ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month.Apple still leads the way on haptics – the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the original in 2015, and they’re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later.One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I’m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress.It’s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people.Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there’s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called “complications”. But I’ve found there’s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can’t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks.I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they’re just bit too small. I’m being picky here, but that’s the thing about something you wear – if it’s not quite how you want it you’re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over.Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time. Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple’s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance.Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis.Most Apple Watch apps aren’t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can’t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app. Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card.Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions. “Hey, Siri” works fine, but activates fairly often when I don’t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn’t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It’s the same on an iPhone, more or less.There’s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it’s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities.Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep.The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing.The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off.For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It’s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There’s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that’s your jam.Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you’re not doing anything.You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat looks irregular.Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple’s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven’t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps.Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you’re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly.The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G.Since its second generation the Apple Watch has been the best smartwatch for the iPhone. But for the Series 5 that’s changed. It’s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place.The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as a bit of a let down in 2015 has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts.After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that’s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger.I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn’t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers.Then there’s the price. At £399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from £199, but doesn’t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under £300 the Series 5 has Apple’s typical premium – but it’s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone.Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it.Pros: excellent haptics, always-on screen, ECG, great health tracking, great activity tracking, solid running watch, 50m water resistance, all-day battery life, offline music, loads of watch faces, quick-swap straps, comfortable, Apple PayCons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no sleep tracking, too popular This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

How has this implicitly racist idea made it to our screens in 2019? I often think, when something new is delivered to our screens, of all the forces that have had to combine over the weeks, months, sometimes years to get it there. From the first stirrings in a dramatist’s mind or the first steps of a documentary maker nosing out a story, and on through the eternally mysterious journey of creation, their ideas are gradually forming until arriving, finally, at the last stage of fruition – the bureaucratic hoops through which all must jump. Commissioners to entice and enthuse, lawyers to please, notes to take in, paperwork to fill out, the long chain of decisionmakers to be appeased, satisfied and made comfortable, until finally the show is given a slot and aired to the masses.This, at least, is what I presume happens. But then programmes such as The British Tribe Next Door turn up and suddenly all certainties are gone, exploded into nothingness by a series – not even a one-off – that sends a suburban British family to live next door to a group of indigenous people in the Namibian desert to see what cultural hijinks ensue. And it is happening here, on Channel 4, in essence a public service broadcaster, and now, in the year of our Lord 2019.It is … exactly as it sounds. The suburban family are the Moffatts, the County Durhamites from Gogglebox, who are perfectly pleasant, inoffensive people distinguished mainly by their eldest daughter, Scarlett, who has both a sense of humour and the rare and charming ability to put her thoughts into TV-friendly words as she is having them. They are taken to Namibia – younger daughter Ava-Grace barely lifting her head from her phone no matter how many breathtaking herds of wildlife pass their jeep – to live for a month with the semi-nomadic Himba people in Otjeme. You might not have expected the programme makers to take the gimmickry this far, by building an exact replica of the Moffatt house there, but other than that there is nothing you would not have suspected.The Himba women who visit the house are staggered, and possibly appalled, by the 20,000 Moffattian possessions it contains (“Why do you need so many things for one person?” one asks, gazing round Scarlett’s cushion-covered, shoe-stuffed bedroom), fascinated and seemingly envious of the dishwasher and washing machine and baffled by the amount of housework that matriarch Betty still finds to do. The men reckon termites will take the lot in a few months.There are some truly fascinating moments that reveal (to the uninitiated in the ways of semi-nomadic tribes in the Namibian desert, among whom I count myself) unsuspected depths to the cultural chasm. The first women to visit the house are perturbed by the idea of having a second floor and then absolutely flummoxed by stairs – “Are we climbing? Will we fall?” – and intrigued by the hall mirror. “I thought there was someone on the other side. It’s like water on the wall.”But it is not enough to justify a series. And even less so a series that – despite what I’m generously going to assume were best efforts in the other direction – fails to avoid putting the tribe in the service of providing teachable moments to the Moffatts – and Scarlett in particular. The reaction in the mirror becomes the story of Scarlett’s insecurities about her body, as does the tribespeople’s desire that she wear their traditional dress.None of this is the Moffatts’ fault. Scarlett’s unfiltered responses serve her well (“I don’t want to offend them,” she says on her way back to the house after a failed attempt to explain why she is not happy about wearing the topless dress, “or make them think I don’t appreciate what they’ve done, because I do …”) but the makers have put them in what seems to me to be an implicitly racist format, working within a tradition that has historically not treated indigenous people well or respectfully, even if there is nothing overtly racist about this specific instance. At the very best, you could say it is a massively flawed premise executed as well as you could hope. At worst, you could say very, very differently. But apparently nobody, at any point in that long, long line of folk responsible between concept and fruition, did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/887edc6bc3e6e0f3a29d8a34ed7d49f9c56b1e45/0_0_5701_3421/master/5701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2e05f6186b24264799b0d6ed1446619","title":"germany berlin cabinet agree five year rent freeze","story":"Proposal to counter rising housing costs still requires approval by state parliamentBerlin’s state cabinet has agreed on a rent freeze for five years to counter rising housing costs in the German capital.The city’s leftwing coalition government wants to freeze the rent for apartments built before 2014, according to a report by the German news agency dpa.Only a minority of Berliners own their homes or apartments and rent has been rising sharply in recent years, forcing many to move outside the city.The city had been a low-rent mecca for many years, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened the gates to the economically depressed former communist east of the city.

Most of all, it cements Moscow’s new role as prime powerbroker in the Middle East as US influence in the region wanes.Turkish troops in areas of north-east Syria seized since the start of the 9 October offensive will remain in situ, and Russian troops and the Syrian army will control the rest of the frontier, effectively fulfilling the goal of Turkey’s Operation Peace Spring at Russia’s discretion: the dilution of Kurdish control over the 270-mile (440km) border corridor.Russian military police and Syrian border guards controlled by the president, Bashar al-Assad, will from Wednesday at noon facilitate the removal of Kurdish fighters and weaponry to the depth of 18 miles from their positions on the border, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said after their respective presidents announced the agreement to reporters.The Kurdish YPG element of the multi-ethnic SDF has 150 hours to withdraw, a joint statement said, and then Turkish and Russian soldiers will begin joint patrols of the entire border area to a depth of 10km with the exception of the de-facto Kurdish capital, Qamishli. The deal appears to also include the contested strategically key town of Manbij as well as the important Kurdish town Kobane. It made no mention of the long-term presence of troops loyal to Assad, now also present in the proposed border zone.The deal also left unclear the fate of the military councils the SDF have set up in towns that were under its control, and what happens to the YPG’s partners inside the SDF including local self-defence forces.No comment on the deal from the SDF or Kurdish political leaders was immediately forthcoming. The umbrella force’s commander-in-chief, Mazloum Kobane, confirmed earlier on Tuesday that his fighters had withdrawn from the border strip between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, the two towns bearing the brunt of the Turkish attack, hours before the poorly observed US-brokered ceasefire ended.The chain of events triggered by Donald Trump’s 6 October announcement that US troops would leave Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria has left Moscow the most powerful player in Syria’s complex war, now in its ninth year.Turkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the SDF, and soldiers belonging to Assad are now all present in the border zone, with Russia the only negotiating force between them.Trump has been widely criticised for his decision to pull back the remaining 1,000 US special forces from the region, which in effect greenlit the Turkish attack on the SDF, the US’s ground partner in the five-year-campaign to defeat Isis. Ankara, however, has long maintained the main Kurdish unit in the SDF is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).As a result of the Turkish offensive, Syria’s Kurdish officials struck a deal with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements in the border area.The US defense secretary, Mark Esper, said that the US troops withdrawn from northern Syria will “temporarily” go to Iraq before returning to the US. Earlier in the day the Iraqi joint operations command said that the retreating US troops did not have permission to remain in the country.Esper told CNN that Trump had yet to approve a plan to keep some troops in eastern Syria to protect oil fields from Isis. He also downplayed the extent to which the retreat had led to Isis jail-breaks from SDF-run detention facilities.Esper said: “Of the 11,000 or so detainees that were in prisons in north-east Syria, we’ve only had reports of a little bit more than a hundred that have escaped... So right now we have not seen this big prison break that we all expected.”Ankara will be pleased that Moscow has persuaded Damascus to cede it control over more territory in the north-east, breaking up Kurdish control. In return, Moscow appears to have extracted commitments from the Turkish delegation that Turkey will respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, raising questions over the future of nearby rebel-held Idlib province, where Turkey maintains observation posts.Assad himself has repeatedly vowed to reunite his entire country under Damascus’s rule. In a symbolic visit to southern Idlib on Tuesday – territory the regime now occupies for the first time in years – he called Erdoğan “a thief” and said he was ready to support any popular resistance against Turkey’s invasion.“We are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later,” he told troops, adding that Kurdish fighters would be granted an amnesty if they returned to the fold of the Syrian government.At least 120 civilians in Syria and 20 in Turkey have died as a result of the almost two-week old assault, with 176,000 Syrians displaced by the violence, the UN said on Tuesday. Intermittent fighting has continued despite a US-brokered ceasefire announced by Mike Pence, the American vice-president, on a visit to Ankara last Thursday.Last week’s US-Turkish agreement did not specify the zone’s size, where Turkey also plans to repatriate up to 2 million of its 3.6 million Syrian refugee population - a policy dubbed demographic engineering by critics.Previous agreements between Washington and Ankara over a safe zone along the Syria-Turkish border floundered time and again over erging definitions of the area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36f311b050937f3f67298334e91d016698fc863/0_460_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede765455753c9447cc23842c947c946","title":"what a day to be gay in northern ireland joy for couples at historic change","story":"As the law changed at midnight, same-sex couples celebrated the culmination of a rollercoaster campaignAmanda Milnes proposed to her partner Christina Conlon in January when same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was illegal. It was an act of love and hope.On Tuesday, 10 months after Milnes went on bended knee and offered a ring, the Belfast couple celebrated a historic change to the law.“What a day to be gay in Northern Ireland,” said Milnes, 29. “What a day to see history happen. It’s just a phenomenal feeling knowing that I will marry Christina, the love of my life, and celebrate until our feet can’t hold us up any longer.”Same-sex couples across Northern Ireland erupted in jubilation at the stroke of midnight on Monday when a law extending marriage equality took effect.It was the culmination of a rollercoaster campaign to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other social conservatives.“We stayed up till 12 and counted down the seconds like it was New Year’s Eve,” said Milnes, a bank worker. “Today we can just take a deep breath and say it’s actually legal, we’ve the same rights as everybody else.”She proposed to Conlon, 30, during a ski holiday, unsure if same-sex marriage would become legal. “Now we can start planning the wedding. We have our guest list sorted. We can go shopping for wedding dresses knowing we’re not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law.”England and Wales enshrined marriage equality in 2013, followed by the Republic of Ireland in 2015. Opinion polls showed a big majority favoured same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the DUP blocked change at the Stormont assembly.Then in 2017, a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed the assembly, creating a vacuum. MPs at Westminster stepped in by passing an amendment in July by a backbench Labour MP, Conor McGinn, extending marriage equality to Northern Ireland.Monday was the last chance for opponents of change to restore Stormont and avert the legislation. The DUP and others attempted a recall to block the extension of abortion rights – a far more contentious change – but the effort failed, allowing liberalisation of both marriage equality and abortion rights.Julian Smith, Northern Ireland’s secretary of state, said the first gay marriage was expected the week of Valentine’s day 2020.“You don’t grow up saying ‘I can’t wait to have a civil partnership’,” said Cara McCann, director of Here NI, a charity that advocates for lesbian and bisexual women. “You grow up saying ‘I want to be married’. They’re different things.”She and her partner Amanda McGurk, 39, had a civil partnership ceremony in Belfast in February. They plan to convert that into a marriage once guidelines are published, said McGurk. “It’s validation for us.”Overt homophobia has ebbed in Northern Ireland. Pride parades have grown in popularity, drawing corporate sponsors, clerics, families, politicians and police. The murder in April of Lyra McKee, a writer and LGBTQ activist who was planning to marry her partner, Sara Canning, channelled grief into demands for change.Anthony Flynn, 28, and his partner Cory Quinn, 25, celebrated the legislation with a bottle of prosecco.“I was incredibly cynical and sceptical of it passing right up until the last moment because we’ve been pushed back so many times in the past,” said Flynn, a software developer and Green party councillor. “Today shows that progress can be made.”After six years together marriage is on the cards, said Flynn. “I’m threatening to pop the question. Both of us come from a traditional family life where marriage is a building block in growing up. I’d be a traditionalist – I want to marry the person I love and build a family around that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c2aed00bdb51f8261a48e1c9dfab64ca5c4b15/263_460_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97c9576f36363035c1dc65460b05a695","title":"chinese cafe featuring dogs dyed to look like pandas facing backlash","story":"‘I suggest dyeing cafe owner black and white,’ says one critic over stunt in Chengdu A cafe in China featuring chow chow dogs painted as panda cubs has prompted widespread criticism over the treatment of the pets.The Cute Pet Games cafe opened last month in Chengdu in the south-west Sichuan province, home to a large proportion of the endangered bear species, featuring six fluffy chow chows dyed white and black.A video of the dogs roaming around the cafe has gone viral on Chinese social media. In the video, posted by Chengdu Economic Daily, the owner of the cafe said it was also offering a dyeing service for 1,500 yuan (£165) to patrons who wished to give their pets a similar makeover.Internet users criticised the cafe’s treatment of the dogs, which were purchased already dyed, according to the owner. “In the name of loving animals, these pet cafes just want to make money,” one said. Another said: “I suggest dyeing the dog owners black and white.”Some pointed to comments by vets that dyeing a dog can damage its skin. “Dogs are dogs. Dyeing them doesn’t turn them into pandas, and they are living beings. You … hurt them just for the sake of what you think looks good.”Others, calling the animals “panda dogs”, defended the cafe owner’s right to change the pets’ appearance. “It’s your dog. You get to decide. Very cute,” one said.Following the online response, the cafe said on its Weibo page that it would not continue to offer the dyeing service. “Chengdu is the home of pandas. We wanted to do something different, to differentiate us from other regular dog cafes and pet shops,” the owner of the cafe, surnamed Huang, told local media.In a statement posted on Weibo on Tuesday, the cafe said: “As their owners, their lives are much better than ours.

At least nine people died and more than 200 were injured due to riots in Jakarta following the fraught campaign, during which Subianto accused Widodo’s government of hosting a “massive, systematic and fraudulent” election.News of Subianto’s expected appointment has caused unrest among many Widodo supporters. Public unease over Subianto wielding power over the armed forces derives from his previous military record. A former son-in-law of the late Indonesian dictator Suharto, Subianto was accused of orchestrating the kidnapping and torture of activists ahead of anti-government demonstrations in 1998 when he was an army commander. He has never been charged in relation to the alleged incidents.Ahead of Subianto’s appointment, Usman Hamid, Amnesty International’s Indonesia executive, said “it would be a dark day for human rights in this country” if he got the defence job.The election campaign fought between Subianto and Widodo was marred by a flood of misinformation. However since the result was announced the pair have appeared together in public, with Subianto saying on Monday that his party, Gerindra, was “ready to help if asked” to bolster the cabinet of the president’s coalition government.When Subianto’s defence minister position was officially announced Widodo said: “I believe I don’t have to tell him about his job – he knows more than I do.”Elsewhere in the cabinet Widodo focused on appointing professionals rather than political party members. Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of ride-hailing company Gojek, was made education and culture minister. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the former World Bank managing director, was reappointed finance minister.As his second term begins, Widodo, 58, faces many challenges beyond his main stated goal of improving the nation’s economy. This month a suspected Isis radical attacked his chief security minister and violence broke out in Papua as protestors marched against alleged abuses by officials and demanded Papuan independence.Widodo has also faced a public backlash over a proposed draconian penal code amendment that would criminalise publicly criticising the Indonesian government and court system. The move has been branded undemocratic by law experts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c0dbb9f9d58324b6b795fcd5365c9c20695720d/0_15_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d532b4b922c6b42c7dac7d77255af6db","title":"kim jong un orders razing of souths unpleasant mount kumgang buildings","story":"North Korean ruler demands makeover of joint resort, saying South Korean facilities are like ‘temporary buildings at construction sites’Kim Jong-un has ordered the demolition of “unpleasant-looking” South Korean facilities at the Mount Kumgang resort – a rare symbol of inter-Korean collaboration – and called for them to be replaced with “modern” buildings constructed by the North.The North’s ruler said it was a “mistake” for the resort, on the east coast, to be regarded as the common property of two Koreas given its location on North Korean soil, according to the state news agency KCNA.“Mount Kumgang is our land won at the cost of blood and even a cliff and a tree on it are associated with our sovereignty and dignity,” Kim said during a visit to the resort this week, KCNA reported, adding that he thought South Korean facilities were “reminiscent of temporary buildings at construction sites”.South Koreans began tours to Mount Kumgang in 1998 but suspended them in 2008 when a female tourist from the South was shot dead by a North Korean soldier for reportedly wandering into a military zone.The resort, built with investment from South Korean firms, has since hosted occasional reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war.Pyongyang is reported to have been angered by South Korea’s failure to resume the tours, amid stalled negotiations over Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmesThe regime has pushed Seoul to ignore US objections to greater inter-Korean cooperation, but any South Korean investment in Kumgang would violate international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.Kumgang, along with the now-closed Kaesong industrial complex just north of the countries’ heavily armed border, was once seen as an example of what they could achieve despite military and political tensions.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has raised the prospect of resuming tours to Kumgang in an attempt to restart inter-Korean cooperation.During their summit in Pyongyang in September 2018, Moon and Kim agreed to resume tours to Kumgang and reopen Kaesong “as soon as the environment is created”. In April this year, Donald Trump described Kumgang as an “unbelievable location” but said the time was “not right” to allow South Koreans to visit.Despite his criticism of South Korean architecture, Kim said: “We will always welcome our compatriots from the South if they want to come to Mount Kumgang after it is wonderfully built as the world-level tourist destination.”Kim also criticised his “predecessors” – believed to be a veiled reference to his father, Kim Jong-il – for encouraging the South to invest in Kumgang. “He made a sharp criticism of the very wrong, dependent policy of the predecessors who were going to rely on others when the country was not strong enough,” KCNA said.The North Korean leader is promoting tourism as a key component of his policy of “self-reliant” economic growth. An editorial in the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said: “The entire people should cherish the belief that self-reliance is the only way to live. There is nothing more foolish than to expect help from others today.”Kim’s pitch for self-reliance came as the UN warned that food insecurity in North Korea was at an “alarming level”, with nearly 11 million people undernourished. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN’s independent investigator on human rights in North Korea said an estimated 140,000 children were suffering from “undernutrition”, including 30,000 who “face an increased risk of death”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f6e2839f90aa29229d2cfa92007c4863303e4a/0_201_2740_1645/master/2740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee6a3b3f8dfd2987a4d9d2bafd9ab2ae","title":"sailing ships cleaning up sea transport oceans","story":"Ethically minded entrepreneurs are turning back the clock to sweep the scourge of bunker fuel from the oceansThey fan out across the seas like a giant maritime dance, a ballet of tens of thousands of vessels delivering the physical stuff that has become indispensable to our way of life: commodities and cars, white goods and gas and grains, timber and technology.But shipping – a vast industry that moves trillions of pounds-worth of goods each year – is facing an environmental reckoning.

He wondered if it would be possible to transport things such as coffee and chocolate with zero emissions. Then he remembered that this was how goods used to travel. By sailing ship.A quick online search revealed that a Dutch company was doing exactly that.The owners of Fairtransport were inspired to revive sail cargo after witnessing at first hand the yellow smog caused by commercial vessels. They restored two ships, a 70-year-old minesweeper renamed the Tres Hombres and a wooden ketch called Nordlys that dates back to 1873.Templeman arranged to board the Tres Hombres, sailing from the Azores to the Netherlands. “I was watching the ocean and it came like a ghost ship through the dawn mist. It looked like a pirate vessel. I was so excited.”He dreamed of launching his own ship but realised that the first step was to make full use of the sailing vessels already in service.He set up as a broker and together with his business partner, Will Adeney, went in pursuit of products to sell. They found their perfect olive oil in Portugal and arranged to have it shipped to Devon on board the Nordlys. They later sourced coffee beans in Colombia, and shipped them to Europe on the Tres Hombres. Their business, Shipped by Sail, was born.It joined a growing network of brokers and sailors passionate about transporting goods by wind power. The next step: to boost demand for this kind of transportation.“Consumers already understand organic produce and fair trade, and the next step is clean transport,” says Cornelius Bockermann, who founded Timbercoast, a German sail cargo company that has restored a schooner from 1920, and is now refitting a second.Clean transport is the missing link, as many so-called sustainable or ethical goods are currently carried on ships that pollute the air and sea. The perfect example of this is plant-based meat, shipped around the world from California.British couple Marcus and Freya Pomeroy-Rowden built their ship, the Grayhound, as a replica of an 18th-century lugger, and carry cargo between the UK and France, bringing West Country ale to Brittany and French wine to Cornwall. They supply small businesses along the way, for example providing wines to Dibble \u0026amp Grub on the Isles of Scilly. The couple enjoy the lifestyle of spending months at sea, making a living, while making a difference.Marcus says they’re bringing trade back to a human scale. “We’re taking quality products and transporting them direct to a distributor. We can understand and explain the whole chain for our products, from manufacture to the table.”In France, TransOceanic Wind Transport has developed a labelling system with a voyage number, allowing the customer to see how products reached them.Broker Alex Geldenhuys launched New Dawn Traders in the UK about six years ago and is still developing her “voyage co-op” model, bringing together farmers, ships and buyers.Geldenhuys has been inspired by local food communities and vegetable box schemes and wants to extend that movement overseas, building relationships with distant farmers to bring ethically produced, high-quality produce to the UK with a carbon footprint that is close to zero. She is seeking “port allies” to promote the idea in coastal communities, encouraging customers to pre-order products from the ships and turning collection events at the docks into celebrations of the whole process.A few weeks ago a French schooner, De Gallant, sailed into Bristol laden with produce from Portugal the first time a tall ship had brought cargo to the city for decades. It was an emotional moment for Geldenhuys and the climax of years of work.“It was beautiful to watch her sailing in under the suspension bridge,” she says. Local people milled around the ship, sampling olive oil, almonds and wines.Geldenhuys acknowledges that currently she can only deliver to her customers twice a year. Templeman says: “Restaurants and other businesses need a regular supply to be reliable. So we’re warehousing goods.” Olive oil on De Gallant was transported by electric van to a restaurant in Bristol.The biggest challenge for sail cargo is scale. There are currently only a few small ships operating. Most companies feel that the time is ripe for expansion and have plans to build larger vessels. One of the founders of Fairtransport, Jorne Langelaan, has set up a new venture called EcoClipper to facilitate emission-free shipping worldwide. He is planning for more sailing ships running more routes more frequently.In Costa Rica, Canadian Danielle Doggett is building a sailing ship called Ceiba, which looks set to become the largest in the world. The project uses tropical trees that have fallen in storms, and more trees are planted as the building proceeds.Ceiba will be able to carry 250 tonnes of cargo (Tres Hombres and De Gallant take 35 tonnes), which is equivalent to around 10 containers. Yet this is still much smaller than the historic tea clippers, such as the Cutty Sark, and dwarfed by the largest modern container ships, which can carry more than 20,000.The shipping industry knows that change is on the horizon. From next year new regulations will further limit sulphur oxide emissions from ships. The International Maritime Organization has announced its ambition to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world’s largest shipping company, Maersk, has gone further, pledging to be carbon-neutral by 2050.Templeman acknowledges that the largest companies want to make their fleets more energy-efficient, but points out: “We’re coming from the opposite direction and offering emission-free shipping right now, while asking what sail shipping could have been with another 100 years of development.”Marcus Pomeroy-Rowden adds: “We’re waving a flag to say the world can’t carry on as it is. We’re also showing what can be done in a different way.”Bockermann stresses that industrial shipping is only cheap because it externalises the environmental costs. “What you normally pay a shipping company doesn’t account for the damage to the environment, pollution or health. Our costs are comparatively high but if you had to pay for the damage of conventional shipping then we wouldn’t seem expensive.”Geldenhuys adds: “We might not be the solution to how everything is shipped in the world but we can make people think about what they’re buying and how it’s getting here. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But we can all do something. We don’t need one solution to everything, we need a thousand solutions that can exist simultaneously.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Photograph: iStockOur family has been based abroad for several years, but my daughter is keen to go to college in Ireland. She is sitting the US college-based AP program this year. Can you advise how this translates in to applying to the Irish university system? In Ireland we have a Central Application Operations (CAO) system through which potential students nominate their college courses of choice.Following the opening of the college application process on 5th November next, your daughter should register with the CAO (cao.ie) and submit her application.Over the coming months she should research all the courses offered through the Irish third level system. Qualifax (qualifax.ie) is a good start. The site is easy to navigate and she should be able identify programmes that meet her needs, both in terms of content and progression opportunities. I would advise her to study every programme in some depth to ensure she is familiar with all aspects of its delivery.She can complete her initial list of course choices on her CAO online application by 1st February next. She will have an opportunity to amend those choices up to 1st July next during the months of May and June next.When her application is being considered by each college, she will be offered the highest course on each of the two lists for which heshe secures the necessary grades in whichever terminal exam she completes.As your daughter is taking the US college-based AP programme, she should tick the ‘other school leaving exams’ box in the qualifications \u0026amp assessments summary section of the online application form. She must then provide details of her school leaving exams and the years they were completed. Make sure she describes the examinations briefly and submit certified A4 photocopies of any certificates, with translations if the certificate is not in English, to CAO, Tower House, Eglinton Street, Galway, Ireland.If she is sitting their examinations in 2020, she must submit certified photocopies of their results to CAO as soon as they become available.If she has any queries about how her application will be assessed, she must contact the admissions office of any college for which she has listed a course. There is no uniformity in how Irish third level institutions treat applications from other jurisdictions and nationalities.In the case of some colleges, they may require the applicant to submit applications directly to the admissions office of the institution in question as well as or instead of to the CAO. Therefore, it is vitally important that your daughter not only identifies each course for which she wishes to be considered, but also checks with that colleges admissions office that she fulfils all their application requirement for her unique circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Judge directed jury at Belfast court to find her not guilty after reform of region\u0026rsquos lawsWorkers called to meeting at Ringaskiddy campus amid restructuring plansOver 20,000 runners from across 50 different countries taking part in Sunday\u0026rsquos raceDanger of infection by cryptosporidium and other bacteria for 600,000 peopleTwo men and a woman arrested after assault and false imprisonment of a 19-year-old manOireachtas committee to hear proposals could cost \u0026euro650m per yearRegina Doherty announces \u0026euro150,000 in funding for establishment of judge-led groupTaoiseach makes remark in State apology to women affected by CervicalCheck scandalLeo Varadkar\u0026rsquos apology was welcome but there are many details about the scandal that are still unclearMcCaffrey says rather than blame others \u0026lsquofor his ills\u0026rsquo Quinn should \u0026lsquolook in the mirror\u0026rsquoNew study reveals that 11 Irish pre-teens are diagnosed with the eating disorder each yearSolicitor says he is stuck in \u0026lsquocatch 22\u0026rsquo due to inability to receive legal aid paymentsYouth organisation\u0026rsquos accounts provide for \u0026lsquoclaims or threatened claims\u0026rsquo from survivorsChanges to NI abortion law and same-sex marriage also cited as issues for Foster\u0026rsquos partyAdults with severe mental health issues \u0026lsquofalling through gaps\u0026rsquo, charity saysDepartment of Health behaved like \u0026lsquoan absentee landlord\u0026rsquo on Traveller health issueCatholic bishops say Stormont could have prevented \u0026lsquodraconian\u0026rsquo Westminster legislationDefence counsel made submissions in trial of Liam Brannigan for conspiring to murder Gary HanleyDisruption aimed at ending two-tier pay system and short-term contracts"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059480.1571771831!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boil water notice for dublin kildare and meath to affect 600 000 people","story":"A boil water notice was issued by Irish Water on Tuesday evening affecting more than half a million people in parts of Dublin, Co Kildare and Co Meath.Roughly 600,000 live in the areas of Fingal, Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council parts of Kildare and in Dunboyne, Co Meath which are affected by the notice.The warning follows issues with a water treatment plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, which may have compromised the disinfection process which makes the water safe to drink.Irish Water said the notice was issued to protect the health of customers on a precautionary measure and came into immediate effect.It said the issues have now been resolved, but affected water is still travelling through the system.A spokeswoman said the notice is likely to be in place for a number of days and that updates will be available on its website and on social media.

On Tuesday, Irish Water issued its largest ever boil-water notice alongside a map showing the areas affected. The danger of infection includes cryptosporidium poisoning, which can severely impact health, particularly among those with vulnerable health issues. According to Irish Water, the initial problem that compromised the disinfectant process at a water-treatment plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, has been repaired. However, the utility said untreated water probably remained in some 20 per cent of supplies in south, west and north Dublin as well as parts of Co Kildare and Co Meath.Irish Water warned there may be “residual” untreated water in the network for several days, as treated water flushes the system. Boil-water notices remain in place, and it is understood the duration of these will be discussed at this morning’s meeting. A spokeswoman said the boil notice is likely to be in place for a number of days and that Irish Water will be continually testing the the supply and liaising with the HSE. Once the HSE is satisfied with the water quality, the notice will be lifted.The spokesman said more information will be released throughout the day as it becomes available. ‘Disastrous’ Irish Water has opened a second investigation into the “disastrous” crashing of its website at a time when it should have been warning more than half a million people that their drinking water was polluted. The utility has blamed an “underlying problem” for the site - which it directs customers to if supplies are contaminated - being unavailable for several hours on Tuesday evening. Yvonne Harris, customer strategy manager with Irish Water, said the website only “recovered” at 11pm. It crashed after a warning was issued shortly after 5pm that around 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area were at risk from their own drinking water. “The timing was really disastrous from an Irish Water perspective,” she said. “Typically when we send out alerts we would direct people to our website. The fact that the website wasn’t available yesterday evening was inconvenient again.”Caution Problems were detected at around 11am on Tuesday. After hours of testing by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health Service Executive, a decision was eventually taken at 4.40pm to issue a boil-water notice to hundreds of thousands of homes. Ms Harris said a “small mechanical failure” at “one of the older elements” of its Leixlip plant caused the pollution. “There may be bugs in the water that would cause a health issue for customers,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. Ms Harris acknowledged confusion among customers about the exact areas impacted, and she urged people to “err on the side of caution”. “If it appears from our website and the maps that you might have seen on social media that you are affected, please boil your water. We would ask customers to err on the side of caution.” Irish Water said water must be boiled for drinking drinks made with water preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating brushing teeth and making ice cubes.It said caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure they do not swallow the bathing water.For the preparation of infant feeds with water, it advises the use of water that has been brought to the boil once and cooled. Water that has been reboiled several times should not be used.It has advised caution if using bottled water for preparing baby food as some natural mineral water may have high sodium content. The legal limit for sodium in drinking water is 200mg per litre.Irish Water said it was contacting all registered vulnerable customers who are affected by this boil-water notice to advise them.It has asked anyone with queries to contact Irish Water on its helpline (1850 278 278) or to check its website (water.ie) for updates.Dublin City councillor and MEP Ciarán Cuffe has called on Irish Water to show what steps it is taking to ensure that such incidents “can not happen again”. He said it was accepted the water supply network was suffering from decades of under-investment but said the utility needed to reassure consumers their taxes were being used wisely in refurbishing the network and that the utility had a plan to prevent further release of untreated water.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA fellow Quinn Industrial Holdings director of tortured Fermanagh businessman Kevin Lunney said he was “shocked” that former billionaire Sean Quinn would make critical comments about them while condemning the attack.Liam McCaffrey, chief executive of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), condemned remarks made by Mr Quinn in an interview last week about the role played by Mr McCaffrey, Mr Lunney and fellow director Dara O’Reilly – all former executives of Mr Quinn’s – in his removal as a senior adviser to the company in 2016. Mr Quinn told Channel 4 News he had “no hand, act or part” in the kidnapping and sustained assault upon Mr Lunney last month, but expressed his disbelief that his “own men who he had looked after for 20 or 25 years” would be involved in his removal as an adviser. He named all three men in the news interview. “The interview was around his denial of any hand, act or part in this, but to take that opportunity to make further critical comment under the circumstances where Kevin had been beaten to within an inch of his life – and Kevin and the remaining directors threatened with death – I thought it was an extraordinary statement,” Mr McCaffrey told The .Campaign of intimidationMr Quinn has condemned the attacks on his former executives, and the long campaign of intimidation and vandalism against his former business. He described the assault on Mr Lunney on September 17th as “despicable and totally barbaric”, and said it was a reason why he was no longer interested in seeking ownership of his former businesses again.Mr McCaffrey worked for Mr Quinn before the 73-year-old lost control of his conglomerate under the weight of about € 4 billion in debts, arising mostly from an ill-fated multi-billion investment on Anglo Irish Bank shares.He rejected his former boss’s criticisms and said Mr Quinn should take responsibility for his own actions. Mr Quinn was removed as an adviser from QIH by the three US investment fund owners of the business because, the funds said, he had grown uncomfortable with his role as an adviser and wanted to take ownership of the company.“Rather than blame everyone else for his ills, he would be well placed to look in the mirror,” said Mr McCaffrey. Further violence fearedThe chief executive of the building materials business, which employs 840 staff in the Cavan-Fermanagh area, said the executives feared further violence given that Mr Lunney’s injuries were “delivered with a threat against us all should we not resign – and that was a death threat”.“There was no indication that that was an end to it. That was a method of delivering a warning,” he said of the attack on Mr Lunney.He said the only way the violence would end was if the “paymaster” behind the attacks was arrested and charged. Law enforcement had to “stand up and be counted”, he said.“Lifting the foot soldiers isn’t enough.” Mr McCaffrey alleged that the gang who carried out the attack came from 40 kilometres away and “work for money”.“They have no beef with the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings, so undoubtedly they were paid to carry out this task,” he said.In an interview with RTÉ’s Prime Time, Mr Lunney’s brother Tony, also a QIH executive, spoke emotionally about not knowing whether his brother was inside his burning car when it was set ablaze by the gang after they abducted Mr Lunney last month.Mr McCaffrey said Mr Lunney was recovering from his physical injuries, including lacerations and a leg broken in two places that has been fixed with a pin.“The physical injuries will heal but it will be a long way back after that ordeal,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

File photograph: Arnd WiegmannReuters.Up to 320 people are set to lose their jobs at the Cork plant of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis over the next three years.The company this morning announced plans to consolidate its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) operations at its Ringaskiddy campus by mid-2022, resulting in the closure of one of its production buildings.In addition, Novartis also announced the relocation of a number of global services roles also located at Ringaskiddy by the end of 2021 to centers in Europe and Asia. The changes come amid an international restructuring programme.Some 550 people work at the Ringaskiddy campus - up to 180 in a Global Business Centre involved in procurement and other business activities with the remainder working in an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient plant.Workers from both operations in Cork were invited to an 8.15am meeting where they were addressed by local site leaders on the company’s plans.No noticeReacting to the news, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the announcment was a “significant blow” and would be “very difficult for the highly skilled workers of Novartis and their families”.“I have spoken to the Ministers for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys, as well as the IDA to ensure all available supports from state agencies are now open to the staff affected by this Novartis announcement. “The staff are highly skilled in the competitive pharmaceutical industry and the state agencies will use the 3-year timeline laid out by Novartis to work with the company and the workers to protect employment.”Heather Humphreys said she was shocked by the news. “We didn’t have any notice of this,” she said. “We are in close touch with all the (multinational) companies all of the time. “But sometimes decisions are made in board rooms not in Ireland and these decisions have an impact on Ireland and on the jobs here. Ultimately this is a decision for the company.”Ms Humphreys said she was “extremely disappointed”, particularly following so quickly from confirmed redundancies at Molex in Co Clare. “There is no denying that this has become a particularly difficult week for Cork, Clare and Munster as a whole,” she said. “The reality is that Ireland is a very open export-orientated economy, and we are operating in an intensely competitive global market and this can sometimes mean that decisions taken by forms abroad.. can sometimes impact on their operations here. That has unfortunately proved the case in respect of Novartis and Molex.” Ms Humphreys said her officials and State investment agency IDA would continue to work with Novartis to see if there are “other opportunities” for job creation at their Ringaskiddy plant and elsewhere in Ireland. ‘Devastating’Meanwhile fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said the announcement was “devastating” for the region.“Since the 1990s this organisation has become one of the biggest employers in Ringaskiddy and the wider area. We all know of many families in the region who have relatives employed with Novartis.“This is a very worrying time for the families and their loved ones. The job losses are particularly disappointing as Novartis in Cork was high end manufacturing. I hope all efforts are made by government and the IDA to prevent as many job losses as possible, to relocate those that lose jobs and to seek an alternative company to invest. Extra efforts have to be made in the far more competitive environment globally.“Support for staff let go in the shape of social protection support, and guidance in seeking new employment opportunities should be provided.“It is important now, that management engage with staff to outline a clear picture for those who face into these jobs losses and that supports from the organisation and the government are provided immediately,” Mr Martin said.Lower costsNovartis employs over 1,200 people in Ireland but it is understood that the proposed restructuring applies only to the Ringaskiddy site where it manufactures drugs for the treatment of hypertension and cardiac problems.The Ringaskiddy plant is part of Novartis Technical Operations which has some 60 sites worldwide and it is understood the company is currently carrying out a review with a focus on centralisation to optimise capacity and lower costs. Novartis, which is headquartered in Basel in Switzerland, is one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies and has had manufacturing operations at Ringaskiddy in the Lower Cork Harbour area for over 25 years.According to the company, Novartis has six healthcare priorities where it is developing new medicines - Respiratory, Neuroscience, Cardiology, Dermatology \u0026amp Rheumatology, Eyecare and Oncology. The company states that it has been recognised as having one of the best pipelines for new drugs while in Irish terms, it ranks as No 3 in terms of the number of clinical trials on new products."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060115.1571822716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit what happened on tuesday night and what could happen next","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the UK parliament awaiting the results of the vote on the programme motion proposing a timetable for the passage of the Brexit Withdrawl Agreement Bill in the House of Commons in London. So what happened?The bill seeking to put Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal into law was passed by MPs in the House of Commons on its second reading, the initial opportunity that MPs have to vote on a bill. It passed by 329 votes to 299, the first time the commons has formally approved a Brexit plan, even though some MPs pointed out they would still seek to have amendments attached at a later stage. However, only 20 minutes later, MPs rejected the UK government’s so-called programme motion, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against.Is it good news for the government that it has won a Brexit deal vote?In one sense, yes, and responding to the 30-vote majority for the withdrawal agreement bill, or WAB, Johnson praised MPs for having “embraced a deal”. But the defeat on the programme motion by 14 votes – a heavier defeat than many expected – is a definite reverse and has now led to fresh uncertainty. The programme motion was important to the government because it argued the compressed timetable – allowing only three commons days for the entire process – was vital if the UK was to leave the EU by the current deadline of October 31st. Many MPs argued this was far too short a time.So what happens now?Under the Benn law intended to ward off a no-deal Brexit, Johnson wrote to the EU on Saturday to formally request a delay to departure until January 31st, despite not wanting this to happen. Responding in the commons on Tuesday evening, Johnson said he would “pause this legislation” and await information from the EU on a possible delay. In the interim, he said, no-deal preparations would be ramped up, though this appears more a threat. For now, the bill is “in limbo”, parliament speaker John Bercow said, using what he said was the technical term.During the debate, Johnson pledged he would pull the bill and seek an election in the event of a delay until January or longer. But he did not promise to do this in any circumstances, holding open the possibility of a brief delay being acceptable. After the vote, Johnson was similarly equivocal, saying: “One way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal.”Does all this make a general election more likely?Probably. If the EU insists on a lengthy delay, which is put in place, Johnson could decide to push for an election, though reports this morning say that there are ided views in Downing Street on this. His alternative is to try to get the legislation through, with a short delay. Crucially, if an imminent no-deal Brexit was now averted, Labour would be expected to now back an election.However, for all his protestations against a longer delay, the 30-vote majority for his Brexit deal could tempt Johnson into trying to push the bill through parliament before an election, allowing him to stand as the prime minister who delivered departure.Did the government offer any last-minute concessions?Yes. Closing the debate for the government, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, promised a last-minute shift aimed at Tory waverers, to give parliament more of a say on avoiding a possible no-deal situation when the transition period ends in December 2020. But this was not enough to rescue the vote.What will MPs do for the rest of this week?On Wednesday and Thursday, when they should have been finishing off the stages of the WAB, they will instead return to debating the Queen’s speech.What is the EU likely to do ?EU council president Donald Tusk said that he would be recommending an extension – and reports suggested he was in favour of acceding to the request in the letter sent from the UK for this to last until January 31st. However, there is frustration in EU capitals. French president Emmanuel Macron reportedly wants a shorter extension and German foreign minister Heiko Mass referred to the possible need for an extension of a few weeks to allow Johnson to seek to get the legislation through. One option would be to grant a “flextension” , giving the UK up to January 31st but making clear they could leave earlier if the legislation was passed in London and also by the EU parliament.So the bottom line here? Is this nearly over?It is possible that Johnson could get the deal through in the next few weeks, though there could be barriers via proposed amendments. If not, a UK general election is the most likely route, with Brexit day delayed – again.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: AFPGetty Images.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told President of the European Council Donald Tusk he supports a Brexit extension for the UK.Speaking on Wednesday morning, the pair noted that it would still be possible for the UK to leave before January 31st 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement was ratified in advance of that date. The issue will be discussed further at Wednesday night’s meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels. Meanwhile in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to push for an election if EU leaders sanction a Brexit extension of up to three months.Mr Johnson must now wait to hear from the heads of the EU27 after his plans to fast-track his Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the House of Commons before the Halloween deadline failed.There was anger in Downing Street after MPs rejected Mr Johnson’s plan to push through the legislation approving his deal with the EU in just three days by 322 votes to 308.The development makes Mr Johnson’s promise to take Britain out of the EU by October 31st “come what may” difficult to fulfil and means Brexit could be delayed until next year.On a dramatic night in Westminster, the Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said Brexit was now “in purgatory where it is suffering the pains of those in purgatory”.Mr Rees-Mogg added it is “very hard to see how it is possible” for the Bill to pass through the Commons and the Lords before October 31st.The result leaves the prime minister effectively at the mercy of EU leaders who will decide whether to grant Britain a further extension, and for how long, in order to allow it to leave with a deal.European Council president Donald Tusk said he would recommend they agree a further delay in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.ElectionThe Daily  reported that Mr Johnson had begun calling EU leaders on Tuesday night to tell them he would not accept a three-month delay, but has reportedly not ruled out approving a short extension of around 10 days to allow his deal to get through Parliament.A No 10 source indicated that if the prime minister was forced to accept a delay until the new year, he would push for a general election instead.“On Saturday parliament asked for a delay until January and today parliament blew its last chance,” the source said.“If parliament’s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This parliament is broken.”Following the vote, Mr Johnson said he would “pause” the legislation while he consulted with EU leaders on what should happen next.Just minutes earlier MPs voted to back the deal in principle by 329 to 299 on the second reading of the Bill, the first time the Commons has been prepared to support any Brexit deal.The prime minister expressed “disappointment” that they had not been prepared to follow it up by agreeing the timetable motion.He insisted it was still his policy that Britain should leave at Halloween but acknowledged he would have wait to hear what EU leaders said.Under the terms of the so-called Benn Act, Mr Johnson was forced to write to the EU at the weekend seeking an extension to the end of January after failing to win the support of the Commons at Saturday’s special sitting.Before the vote, Mr Johnson had threatened to pull the whole Bill and go for a general election if the timetable motion was lost but he is yet to outline how he would go about it.‘Reasonable timetable’Jeremy Corbyn said Labour was prepared to work with the UK government to agree “a reasonable timetable” to enable the Commons to debate and scrutinise the legislation properly.“That would be the sensible way forward, and that’s the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight,” he said.The Labour leader’s offer potentially opens the way for Parliament to approve the Bill before the end of the year.It also opens up increased opportunities for MPs to seek to amend the legislation in ways the Government would find unacceptable.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he thinks the EU will grant a three-month extension and, speaking on BBC’s Newsnight, he said: “There’s no excuses now for Jeremy Corbyn not to give us that general election.”Asked about Mr Johnson’s “do-or-die” promises to deliver Brexit on October 31st, he said: “Everyone will have seen the way that Boris Johnson has tried to get Brexit across the line on the 31st of October.”He said that date was ruled out on Tuesday night, adding: “We’re going to have to have an extension.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But there is one thing that their pitch has in common: exam results.And a question often at the forefront of parents’ minds is:  Will it be worth it?With fees rising year on year, how do you know if a school is good value for money? Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool allows you to search for every school in England  - where their GCSE results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others in terms of value for money. Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded As and A*, or grades 7 to 9, in GCSEs or iGCSEs in 2019.Independent schools value for money - GCSE day (behind subwall)How it worksToday we are publishing the data for GCSE results and next week we will do the same for A-level results.We have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools which generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellersby College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsSearch for the best independent schools for 2019 A-level resultsSearch for the best grammar schoolsMeanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellersby College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university. We\u0027re extremely proud of every cohort.DLD College said they work with a number of students who have found education “challenging”, and success cannot be measured by looking grades alone.“Our students enjoy five-star, secure and safe boarding in the same building with a strong co-curricular programme to match, a spokesman said. “For these reasons, the cost of boarding in this part of London cannot be easily compared with the cost of a boarding school in other locations.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The number of electric vehicles on the roads in the city increased after the scheme was implemented.Launching a\u0026nbspconsultation on\u0026nbspthe new plans on Tuesday, transport secretary Grant

needed to slash emissions from transport.Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates said:\u0026nbsp“Green number plates may encourage some people to choose cleaner cars, but if ministers really want to boost the take-up of electric vehicles they should introduce more charging points and better financial incentives.“A national\u0026nbspscrappage\u0026nbspscheme is urgently needed too, to help fund a switch to a cleaner vehicle or greener transport alternative – such as car club membership, a rail season ticket or even an e-bike loan.”Friends of the Earth said the only real solution to the problem is to cut traffic levels by ending the government’s multi-billion-pound road-building programme and investing instead in\u0026nbspaffordable and efficient public transport, and safer cycling and walking facilities.The DfT hopes more people will consider buying cleaner cars when they see the plates which have three potential designs: a\u0026nbspfully green plate with black letters, a yellow plate with a green bar on one side, or a yellow plate with a green dot or symbol.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is almost a fifth higher than the offer from Amsterdam-based Takeaway.Still, the board of Just Eat rejected the overture from Prosus as it “significantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects”,\u0026nbspand recommended that shareholders do the same.Just Eat is the largest food delivery company in the UK but analysts have criticised its management’s failure to capitalise on its early dominance of the rapidly growing sector, allowing nimbler rivals like Deliveroo to gain ground.In its statement, aimed at Just Eat shareholders, Prosus said it believes the business will require substantial investment, over and above that planned by the company’s management.Amazon investment in Deliveroo halted as watchdog launches probeJust Eat announces £9bn merger with TakeawayJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on app“Just Eat’s third-quarter trading update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights the need to accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage,”\u0026nbspit said.“Prosus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway will fully or effectively address this investment need.”Just Eat and Takeaway face tough competition from rivals with deep pockets such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo, which is backed by Amazon.The bid from Prosus follows a string of foreign acquisitions of British companies. Earlier this year, US toymaker Hasbro bought the UK-listed owner of\u0026nbspPeppa\u0026nbspPig, while Britain’s biggest pub owner Greene King agreed to sell its entire business to\u0026nbspCKA, a Hong Kong real estate group. Meanwhile, Fuller’s, another UK pub group, sold its brewing business to Asahi, Japan’s largest brewer.Just Eat’s shares surged 20 per cent shortly after Prosus announced its offer and traded about\u0026nbsp25 per cent higher on the day in the afternoon.He added that a merger or a takeover of sufficient scale would create a company with the heft to take on Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Amazon.Prosus already has other investments in the food-delivery sector, including iFood in Latin America, Berlin-based Delivery Hero and Swiggy in India.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The measure for export prospects came in at -46, the lowest since October 2001.“Brexit concerns have clearly driven concern about the near-term outlook for exports, with citations of political and economic uncertainty abroad and quotaimport licence restrictions spiking to multi-decade highs,” the CBI said.Investment intentions also worsened, with planned spending on buildings, plants and machinery, and training and retraining posting the sharpest drops since early to mid-2009, when Britain was still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis.\u0026nbspLikewise, manufacturers expect their output to fall in the next three months at the fastest pace since early 2009, compounding the\u0026nbspdecline between August and October.Hazy trade outlook and jumpy pound seen as top barriers to UK exportsNo-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 impact on car industryUK manufacturing shrinks for fifth month in a row amid Brexit turmoilHeadcount in the sector fell at its fastest since April 2010, with firms anticipating an even sharper decline in the next three months.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the global economic downturn also played a part and noted that the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the government announced a new Brexit deal.But he added: “With the accompanying political declaration laying out a harder former of Brexit than previously envisaged, with a clear commitment to take Britain out of the customs union, we doubt that manufacturers have become more optimistic since the new deal was struck. The downturn in the manufacturing sector, therefore, looks like it has plenty further left to run.”Boding ill for future output, the survey’s measure for manufacturers’ total order books was at its lowest since January 2010 and worse than expected by economists.Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “Finding a resolution that avoids a no-deal Brexit will give firms the confidence they need to step up investment in people, growth and innovation.“But for long-lasting prosperity we need an ambitious free trade agreement which provides tariff-free access to our largest trading partner for our manufacturers right across the country.”Another survey showed earlier this month that uncertainties around Brexit and future tariffs, as well as the volatile pound are holding back British exports.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe CBI interviewed 258 firms between 25 September and 14 October.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But graduates born in 1970 earned 19 per cent more than their peers who did not go to university.The graduate premium - a term\u0026nbspused to refer to how much more graduates are likely to earn on average compared with their peers without a degree - fell by eight percentage points\u0026nbspduring this period.\u0026nbspIt comes after\u0026nbspa major expansion in the numbers of people going on to higher education in recent years.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ships out at sea before the sun rises off the coast of Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandHundreds of students take part in the traditional Raisin Monday foam fight on St Salvator\u0027s Lower College Lawn at the University of St Andrews in Fife.

The number of electric vehicles on the roads in the city increased after the scheme was implemented.Launching a\u0026nbspconsultation on\u0026nbspthe new plans on Tuesday, transport secretary Grant Shapps said: “Green number plates are a really positive and exciting way to help everyone recognise the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads.“By increasing awareness of these vehicles and the benefits they bring to their drivers and our environment, we will turbo-charge the zero-emission revolution.”Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with

needed to slash emissions from transport.Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates said:\u0026nbsp“Green number plates may encourage some people to choose cleaner cars, but if ministers really want to boost the take-up of electric vehicles they should introduce more charging points and better financial incentives.“A national\u0026nbspscrappage\u0026nbspscheme is urgently needed too, to help fund a switch to a cleaner vehicle or greener transport alternative – such as car club membership, a rail season ticket or even an e-bike loan.”Friends of the Earth said the only real solution to the problem is to cut traffic levels by ending the government’s multi-billion-pound road-building programme and investing instead in\u0026nbspaffordable and efficient public transport, and safer cycling and walking facilities.The DfT hopes more people will consider buying cleaner cars when they see the plates which have three potential designs: a\u0026nbspfully green plate with black letters, a yellow plate with a green bar on one side, or a yellow plate with a green dot or symbol.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is almost a fifth higher than the offer from Amsterdam-based Takeaway.Still, the board of Just Eat rejected the overture from Prosus as it “significantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects”,\u0026nbspand recommended that shareholders do the same.Just Eat is the largest food delivery company in the UK but analysts have criticised its management’s failure to capitalise on its early dominance of the rapidly growing sector, allowing nimbler rivals like Deliveroo to gain ground.In its statement, aimed at Just Eat shareholders, Prosus said it believes the business will require substantial investment, over and above that planned by the company’s management.Amazon investment in Deliveroo halted as watchdog launches probeJust Eat announces £9bn merger with TakeawayJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on app“Just Eat’s third-quarter trading update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights the need to accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage,”\u0026nbspit said.“Prosus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway will fully or effectively address this investment need.”Just Eat and Takeaway face tough competition from rivals with deep pockets such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo, which is backed by Amazon.The bid from Prosus follows a string of foreign acquisitions of British companies. Earlier this year, US toymaker Hasbro bought the UK-listed owner of\u0026nbspPeppa\u0026nbspPig, while Britain’s biggest pub owner Greene King agreed to sell its entire business to\u0026nbspCKA, a Hong Kong real estate group. Meanwhile, Fuller’s, another UK pub group, sold its brewing business to Asahi, Japan’s largest brewer.Just Eat’s shares surged 20 per cent shortly after Prosus announced its offer and traded about\u0026nbsp25 per cent higher on the day in the afternoon.He added that a merger or a takeover of sufficient scale would create a company with the heft to take on Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Amazon.Prosus already has other investments in the food-delivery sector, including iFood in Latin America, Berlin-based Delivery Hero and Swiggy in India.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are movies.Iger also pointed out that people are watching Marvel\u0027s films by the millions” and added: It seems so disrespectful to all the people that work on those films… are you telling me Ryan Coogler, making Black Panther is doing something that is somehow or another \u0027less than\u0027 what Marty Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola have ever done on any one of their movies?\u0026nbspLike, come on. There. I said it.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America.

Quantum computers are theoretically capable of doing work vastly quicker than the computers we use today, and could fundamentally alter our understanding of the capability of machines.IBM researchers have already criticised Google\u0027s claims of a breakthrough, suggesting that the new discovery is not as profound as promised. But the new research has finally been published in the prestigious journal\u0026nbspNature, and lays out the workings of the long-rumoured breakthrough.The Google researchers state in the paper that their computer, known as Sycamore, is able to conduct a task in 200 seconds that would take around 10,000 years on a traditional system.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm, the researchers write in the newly published paper.‘Quantum apocalypse’: How super computers could cripple governmentsThe task used by Google researchers to test their system is largely useless for now, and its main function is to generate random numbers. But it is the first time that any task of this kind has ever been successfully demonstrated, and could very soon lead to more practical applications, the researchers claim.As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities, the researchers conclude.\u0026nbspWe are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.The company now hopes to build a system that can conduct more broad operations, which could be used across a variety of different fields.Achieving the necessary computational capabilities will still require years of hard engineering and scientific work. But we see a path clearly now, and we’re eager to move ahead.Google\u0027s breakthrough had been rumoured since an early version of the paper was leaked online last month. But the publication of the research in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbspis the first time it has been publicly discussed, and anyone can read the researchers\u0027 work.It had already been criticised by IBM, who argued that the paper was fundamentally flawed because Google had drastically overestimated the difficulty of the task and how long it would take on a classical computer. The task would actually take around 2.5 days on a classical\u0026nbspcomputer and would be completed better than it was with Google\u0027s quantum computer, the firm argued in a blog post published two days before the\u0026nbspNature paper was made available.The phrase quantum supremacy has also attracted criticism, both for its similarity to white supremacy and the fact it could encourage more hyped reporting on the status of quantum technology. Both of those arguments were addressed by John Preskill, the scientist who coined the phrase in 2012, in a recent article where he concluded that Google\u0027s breakthrough is nonetheless very significant.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The measure for export prospects came in at -46, the lowest since October 2001.“Brexit concerns have clearly driven concern about the near-term outlook for exports, with citations of political and economic uncertainty abroad and quotaimport licence restrictions spiking to multi-decade highs,” the CBI said.Investment intentions also worsened, with planned spending on buildings, plants and machinery, and training and retraining posting the sharpest drops since early to mid-2009, when Britain was still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis.\u0026nbspLikewise, manufacturers expect their output to fall in the next three months at the fastest pace since early 2009, compounding the\u0026nbspdecline between August and October.Hazy trade outlook and jumpy pound seen as top barriers to UK exportsNo-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 impact on car industryUK manufacturing shrinks for fifth month in a row amid Brexit turmoilHeadcount in the sector fell at its fastest since April 2010, with firms anticipating an even sharper decline in the next three months.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the global economic downturn also played a part and noted that the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the government announced a new Brexit deal.But he added: “With the accompanying political declaration laying out a harder former of Brexit than previously envisaged, with a clear commitment to take Britain out of the customs union, we doubt that manufacturers have become more optimistic since the new deal was struck. The downturn in the manufacturing sector, therefore, looks like it has plenty further left to run.”Boding ill for future output, the survey’s measure for manufacturers’ total order books was at its lowest since January 2010 and worse than expected by economists.Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “Finding a resolution that avoids a no-deal Brexit will give firms the confidence they need to step up investment in people, growth and innovation.“But for long-lasting prosperity we need an ambitious free trade agreement which provides tariff-free access to our largest trading partner for our manufacturers right across the country.”Another survey showed earlier this month that uncertainties around Brexit and future tariffs, as well as the volatile pound are holding back British exports.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe CBI interviewed 258 firms between 25 September and 14 October.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A\u0026nbsptask\u0026nbspthat will last six days, the deal said.\u0026nbspAt that moment Russian and Turkish forces\u0026nbspwill begin joint patrols\u0026nbsp10km into\u0026nbspthe buffer-zone area.\u0026nbspThe agreement, if successfully implemented, will likely\u0026nbspherald the end of Turkey\u0027s incursion in northern Syria. It may also consolidate the Syrian\u0026nbspgovernment\u0027s hold over northeastern Syria which until two weeks ago had been controlled by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPresident Vladimir\u0026nbspPutin opened the Tuesday press conference saying\u0026nbspthat Moscow “appreciates” Turkey’s national security concerns but insists “Syria must be free from foreign military presence.”Mr Erdogan outlined the understanding saying:\u0026nbsp”The main aim of the operation is to take out PKKYPG terror organisations from the area and to facilitate the return of Syrian\u0026nbsprefugees.”“This operation also guarantees\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspterritorial integrity and political unity. We never had any interest in Syria\u0026nbspland and sovereignty,” he added.The two presidents met as a five-day cease-fire between Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria was set to expire.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The water pipeline, which got hit by an airstrike\u0026nbspand served more than 500,000 people, is still not functioning.

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the very least I think she should have been given a break when she was pregnant.I particularly feel for her about her relationship with her dad and her family as that must be hard to deal with in itself, and even worse when every communication she attempts to have with her family is all over every newspaper.For me she has done nothing wrong but seems to get a lot more bad press than Kate.In the clip where she says she’s struggling, I think the sadness in her eyes says everything.PR expert and dad-of-three Anthony Burr, , of Burr Media, lives in London. He says:Sacrices are expected from any royal and once you enter what we term ‘public le’ it is just that – you live your le in the public view.Meghan was being as open and as candid as we have seen any royal, possibly since Diana. Yet as a Royal there is protocol and there is a duty to protect the Queen and the realm.Meghan has to strike that balance.It is possible to sacrice parts of your privacy whilst also keeping other parts private. William and Kate are striking that balance perfectly.The problem with being too candid is you leave yourself open to enemies. As a dad, I will ask my girls to decide carefully when and who you should be open with.It’s not easy for Meghan, and it will take some time but she can bridge that gap between celebrity and royal andshe gets it right then she can be an icon for years to come.His daughter Tatjana Mager-Burr, , is a Year  student.She says: Its a democratic country. Meghan and Harry should be able to speak their minds.How open they should be really depends on the situation. [Perhaps not]Meghans having arguments with Harry... you dont want the royal family to be viewed as falling apart.Its unusual for royals to come clean about their situation - they usually stay reserved. I feel [this documentary] could be a way of opening up attitudes towards the royals.Biba Tanya, , is a blogger from Ribble Valley in Lancashire.She says: It’s the ‘poor me’ attitude that I just think is absurd. What was the quote  ‘We’re existing but not living’  Are you f*****g joking me There are people using food banks who are existing and not living, sweetheart, not people who are flying private jets to their baby showers. That’s not living, that’s living in style. Her line ‘thank you so much for asking’ - it’s pathetic! I got an A* in Drama Megan, I’m probably about as talented as you are!Harry threw a royal tantrum a few days ago when he was asked a rogue question by a reporter. It was a perfectly reasonable question and he completely flipped his lid.William is more of an example. He doesn’t complain at least. It’s the complaining that everyone’s finding unbearable. It does make me smile when I see that Kate’s handling this with such aplomb. Shes never complained once – she just cracks on.Who are you  You’re just these mythical creatures who live off our money without letting us know what you’re truly thinking.I once went on GMB and publicly declared that I don’t vaccinate my children – you want to see the trolling that I got. I’m a big girl – I pulled my big girl pants up and got on with it!

If they feel that it’s best for them to leave the royal family and go to Africa then they should go.Also Meghan is facing the pressure of being in the spotlight plus the hardship of being a new mother. She also has the social pressure put on her by the media always expecting her to put on a smile and act like everything is okay.School safeguarding head Jane Baldwin lives in Kent.She says: I think in their position they are a representation of our country and should not air their dirty laundry in public.I also believe in these dficult political times, when people are facing job loss etc, moaning about media coverage - which I might add is what charities need and is the purpose of their tour and not forgetting Meghan’s movie career thrived on this - is not appropriate.I have always thought Harry tried to be in touch with us common folk, following his mums approach.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”.

It also lets Russian and Syrian troops control the rest of the border.Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the agreement was very important,not momentous, to resolve what is a pretty tense situation which has developed on the Syrian-Turkish border”.It prompted Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute, to boast on Twitter: “The outcome of the Putin-Erdogan meeting in Sochi today indicates that Erdogan has become a master of leveraging the US and Russia against each other to maximise Ankara’s gains.“Turkey got the safe zone it wanted all this time.”A complete pullout would mark a victory for Erdogan, who launched Turkeys incursion on October  to drive the Kurdish militia from the border and create a safe zone for theof Syrian refugees.However, Germanys defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer,  has proposed the establishment of an internationally-controlled security zone in Syria.She said it would de-escalate the situation in northern Syria.German chancellor Angela Merkel said the idea seemed very promising, eventhere are many questions.Turkey will maintain control over the areas it holds since its incursion of northeastern Syria on October  to drive the Kurdish militia from the border.It also lets Russian and Syrian troops control the rest of the border.Syrian border guards will be deployed from noon on October  - when Turkeys five-day cease-fire expired.Six days later, Russian and Turkish forces will jointly start to patrol a narrower, km strip of land in the “safe zone” that Ankara has long sought in northeast Syria.Kurdish fighters completed their pullout from areas Turkey invaded this month.A Kremlin spokesman warned thatKurdish forces dont fully retreat from the entire northeastern Syrian border, they will face the Turkish army.Under the deal with Moscow, theof border which the Kurds would be required to pull back from is more than triple the size of the territory covered by the US-Turkish accord.In a victory for Turkey, this covers most of the area it had wanted to initially include in its safe zone.The agreement achieves Turkeys long-held goal of a border strip cleared of the US allies, which Ankara regards as a terrorist organisation because of their links to insurgents inside Turkey. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That could prompt Boris Johnson to drop his paused deal altogether and push for an election. It came after a night of Commons drama just nine days before the UK is meant to leave the EU. And yet again it leaves us all in limbo just when we thought we’d get a final decision. So what happened tonight and what happens now  Here’s what you need to know.  MPs voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its second reading .This is legislation that turns Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal into UK law. In a historic move, MPs finally backed it - - which naturally is % to %. But crucially, they voted against the ‘programme motion’. The programme motion sets how much time the Commons has to scrutinise a Bill. Johnson had wanted to restrict this to just three days in order to meet his  “do or die” pledge to leave the EU by October . MPs said that was too short for such a momentous piece of legislation and voted down the programme motion by  votes to .  Yes, it looks like it. European Council President Donald Tusk tonight sent a message to all  EU leaders telling them they should delay Brexit for three months. This is in accordance with the request MPs forced Boris Johnson to send over the weekend. Boris Johnsonaposs decision to pause the process of ratication of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, Mr Tusk wrote. I will recommend the EU accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure. A written procedure suggests a special summit in Brussels would not be convened. What happens now with the Brexit deal   Boris Johnson had warned he would pull the whole Withdrawal Agreement Billhe lost the vote on the programme motion. Instead he “paused” the Bill while he waits to see what Brussels decides. But he could now drop the Bill after all and push for an election after the EU indicated itaposll back a three-month delay to January . That is because he had previously threatened to do exactly thata three-month extension was granted. He had told MPs: “I will in no way allow months more of this. “If Parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen, and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this. “With great regret I must say the Bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election . Can Boris Johnson actually force an election  No. No matter what he claims, he needs MPsapos permission. More of this further down this article. Can Brexit still happen on October    Technically yes, but it’s very unlikely. The only way isEU leaders refuse an extension. Notably the PM and No refused to guarantee the UK will still leave on October . The pledge - usually throughout his speeches - was notably absent tonight. But the PM said he would ramp up preparations for a no-deal exit just in case.  No. Whatever happens Boris Johnson will now have missed this deadline, despite saying he would rather “die in a ditch” than remain in the EU after that date. Eventhe EU grants him a short extension there is no guarantee his Bill will get through Parliament in its current form. That is because Opposition MPs have tabled amendments to the Bill. They include calls for the UK to stay in a customs union, for a second referendum and a move to stop Johnson crashing out without a deal later down the track.MPs who voted for the Withdrawal Bill at the second reading, including many of the  Labour MPs who backed it this time, could turn against it at the final showdownthese amendments are not accepted. That depends on theand terms of any extension. There are three paths to an election. Boris Johnson could try again to overturn the Fixed Term Parliament Act but this requires a majority of two thirds of MPs . This means Labour can block the move. The second way is for Johnson to try to repeal the Act entirely but this would allow opposition parties to amend the Bill. They could add votes at age  or a second referendum as the price for granting an election. The other method is for the Prime Minister to be ousted in a vote of no confidence. MPs would then have fourteen days in which to form an alternative government. If that proves impossible an election follows  working days later.The risk with this is either Jeremy Corbyn or a government of national unity could take over and then arrange for soft Brexit that would be put to a referendum.

On the Today programme he added: As soon as no-deal is off the table we want a general election to get the Tories out, we are not in the business of leaving the Conservatives in power. Last night European Council President Donald Tusk said he would call on the EU to back Britainaposs call for the three month extension.    The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that the government would call a pollthataposs the only way of resolving this Brexit deadlock, then yes, bring it on. Last night a No.  source said the government would call an election. They said: Parliament and Corbyn have repeatedly voted for delay. On Saturday Parliament asked for a delay until January and today Parliament blew its last chance. If Parliament’s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This Parliament is broken. The public will have to choose whether they want to get Brexit done with Boris or whether they want to spend  having two referendums on Brexit and Scotland with Corbyn. It comes as Britain faces fresh chaos as the Prime Minister was forced to abandon his do or die October  deadline vow and ask the EU for a further delay to the UKaposs departure.    Earlier today Boris Johnson lost a vote on his preferred timetable for passing Brexit legislation. He was forced to pause the process and to ask the EU to decide on what he called Parliamentaposs request for a further delay to Britainaposs departure. The PM paused his Brexit deal after the House of Commons refused to accept a bid to rush it through in three days. The dayaposs events sees the PM forced to abandon his do or die vows to leave the EU by the October  deadline - in just nine daysapos time. Downing Street earlier today refused to confirm the UK would still leave by the hard-line deadline of Halloween .    Instead Mr Johnson said: One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which the House has just given its assent. The development saw EU chief Donald Tusk confirm he would ask the blocaposs  members states to agree to Mr Johnsonaposs forced request for a three-month delay, in an effort to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The EU members do not have to accept the request, and can force a shorter extension. Mr Johnson was backed into reluctantly requesting the extension on Saturday, after MPs forced his hand.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFriends of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have accused the royal family of not giving them the recognition they deserve. In an astonishing attack, sources claimed Harry and Meghan have “single-handedly modernised the monarchy” yet advisers remain incapable of “harnessing their value”. It followed a row over the couple’s comments in a TV documentary on Sunday, in which they spoke of their “struggle” with le in the public eye.And it came as Meghan, , was tonight seen for the first time since the ITV show aired, smiling as she attended the One Young World Summit opening ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London.   Max Foster, an anchor and royal correspondent for US news network CNN, said a source close to the Sussexes told him: “The institution around the royal family is full of people afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple who, they said, ‘have single-handedly modernised the monarchy’.” Buckingham Palace aides tonight refused to comment – but the news sent shockwaves through the ious households. The Mirror previously revealed that senior royals believed Harry and Meghan were “in a moment of crisis” after their candid comments aired on Sunday, in a documentary covering their recent tour.  Harry, , has finally confirmed rumours of a rt with brother Prince William that palace aides had been at pains to deny. Speaking to ITV news anchor Tom Bradby, who he has been friends with for nearly  years, he said: “Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under inevitably, you know, stuff happens. “But look, we’re brothers. We’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and I know he’ll always be there for me.  “You know, we don’t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we’re so busy. But I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. Just as I said, as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.” Sources have confirmed to the Mirror that the brothers have spoken and “frank words were exchanged”. Sources close to William – who reportedly did not see the documentary ahead of its broadcast – have claimed he was “furious”. Kensington Palace aides were quick to suggest his feelings were out of concern for his brother and Meghan.  An emotional Meghan spoke in the show of the “really challenging” time of being a new mother in the spotlight, saying: “It’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.” The day after it aired, William was said to be “worried” about the couple and “hoped they were alright”. But Foster today revealed his source said “palace leaks” had driven “hysteria” over Harry’s comments. Harry and Meghan have had mixed responses to the documentary.    In the film, a subdued Meghan said pregnancy is a “vulnerable” time and not many people had asked after her wellbeing. She added she had “tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stf upper lip” but was left feeling hurt over negative coverage they received. Harry told of the stress of public le too, revealing his mental health is under “constant management”. The Duke and Duchess have also been widely criticised for certain lestyle choices over the past year. They were accused of hypocrisy over their decision to use private jets while campaigning about climate change.    And they have been affected by the behaviour of Meghan’s estranged dad Thomas, who has given embarrassing interviews in a bid to heal their rt. The -year-old failed to attend her wedding last May after he was caught colluding with paparazzi. Sadly, she has not seen Thomas since before her big day and he has yet to meet her five-month-old son Archie. But Meghan has also been accused of playing the media – with claims she briefed friends to speak to reporters.    In February, five close pals “opened up” on the woman they “know and love” after her fallout with Thomas. The interview, painting Meghan in a hugely positive light, described her as a “selfless friend who writes thank-you notes for reasons big and small”. Meanwhile, Meghan was all smiles at tonight’s One Young World Summit bash. She wowed in a violet Aritzia Babaton Maxwell dress as she was greeted by Royal Albert Hall president Ian McCullough and the group’s managing director, Ella Robertson.

The -year-old ate around £,-worth of take out a year, and would even have two dinners a night. Chy, from Cumbernauld, Scotland, was so unhappy from a previous relationship she would eat curries, Big Macs and chip shop dinners to deal with her problems. After ballooning to a size  and weighing st, she claims she struggled to walk just a few steps - and couldnapost even tie her shoelaces as her waistline expanded.    Struggling to shed two stone on her own, Chy was referred for a gastric sleeve on the NHS. The health and social care student eventually ended her dead-end relationship and in May , she met her new husband Owen, , on Plenty of Fish. With his support, she has transformed her le. The loved-up pair tied the knot this summer, as the new confident Chy beamed in a size  dress - after halving her body weight to st. She said: Wearing my wedding dress after losing all that weight felt amazing. I was so surprised when it fit. Being told I looked stunning all day took a bit of getting used to, to be honest. After being in a one-sided relationship for years, I felt really proud of myself. Before I couldnapost walk even a few steps. I can even tie my shoelaces again. I can now walk without turning red and getting out of breath.    I saved myself from a heart attack. Iaposm ashamed [of how I used to be]. Now, I feel like a normal person again and have such a healthier le. Feeling unhappy in her relationship, Chy had binged on Indian takeaways and chocolate - spending up to £ a day on greasy meals. But as a newly single woman in May , Chy did try to lose weight - though shedding just two stone in a year. And when her obesity left her unable to walk just a few steps, she had a gastric sleeve fitted in September . As the months passed, she saw the weight melt away and before she knew it, she was ordering a size  wedding dress - something she never dreamt was possible.    Three weeks before her wedding in July this year, she was amazed to try on the beautul gown and feel it slip over her slim frame - excitedly sending it off for alterations. Chy said: My wedding dress was ordered from America and it arrived just four weeks before the wedding. It was altered around three weeks before the big day to a size . On the day I felt amazing. I have much more self worth. Now I have the support of a wonderful husband and feel a lot better about myself. The surgery changed a lot. Iaposve got the support I need now and I know anything is possible.    I had to re-program my brain when it came to food and Iaposve learnt a lot. Iaposm at my target weight now and will be keeping at it. When she first started her search of love more than a year ago, Chy never imagined she would be settling down into married le already. But she admits finding love and being able to rely on Owen possibly saved her le. Chy said: I have always had problems with my weight and due to the situation with my ex, it was made worse. The relationship triggered me to put on weight.

Sarah Najjar, , from Bristol, decided to pay £ for the procedure because of concerns about her lips deflating after her th birthday. She admired the pillowed pouts the fillers had produced on other people, however the procedure left her with swollen, lumpy lips. Sarah, who had to fork out a further £ to have the filler dissolved, was so traumatised by the experience that she decided to train in facial aesthetics to prevent others from suffering the same fate as her. She said: “My lips swelled up after I had the filler injected, which I initially thought was normal – but after a week you could see all these huge blue lumps and they felt rock hard.    “You could see them when I was talking. I was so self-conscious. “I was in shock at what I ended up going through for what I’d thought was a simple procedure. As a result, I decided to train in facial aesthetics to understand what had gone wrong – but now, I also want to help other people looking to get fillers done to make sure they understand the risks. “I get so many women coming in for corrective work after getting botched fillers, and they always say the same thing, ‘I went somewhere cheap.’ But you have to think, it’s cheap for a reason, and it ends up costing you far more to fix it.”  Having lip fillers done - her first cosmetic procedure - in  after worrying her natural pout was becoming deflated, believing it to be a simple procedure, Sarah did very little research before going ahead. She continued: “I admit I didn’t research it much which really isn’t like me at all. But I never got told about the risks or complications that could arise.” After her appointment – during which one millilitre of filler was injected into her lips – she experienced some swelling, which she assumed was normal. A week later, though, it became clear that something had gone terribly wrong.    She explained: “My lips were very lumpy and uneven, so I went back to the injector who had done them, and they suggested that even more filler would even them out. “Looking back, I know that’s not right now, but at the time, I trusted what I was being told and just wanted it fixed. “So, I had another one millilitre injected – meaning I’d had two millilitres in just two weeks. “I woke up and my lips were more swollen than ever – literally about two centimetres in front of my face – and rock hard.    “I had to go into work and my practise manager was really shocked, asking me what on earth had happened.” Thankfully, the swelling eventually eased, but Sarah said that her lips were lumpier than ever. She added: “I was having to massage my lips to break the filler down.” With a family wedding approaching, which she wanted to ensure she looked presentable for, Sarah had no choice but to find a dermatologist who could help reverse the damage. After researching extensively, she found a specialist who was able to inject her with hyaluronidase – a family of enzymes that can break down hyaluronic acid, the ingredient used in most lip fillers. “That cost me £ – more than double what I’d paid for the original fillers,” she said. “I did have a slight allergic reaction to the hyaluronidase and my mouth swelled, but I was given antihistamines.    “I actually had the appointment on Christmas Eve, so it was amazing they could see me, as I assumed the doctor would be closed or very busy. “I was under review for two days after that and, thankfully, my lips began ing to normal.” Shaken by her experience, Sarah decided to take a course in facial aesthetics herself on London’s renowned Harley Street. Now, after becoming officially trained and qualied to perform injectable filler procedures, she works at The Dental Surgery in Clton Village, Bristol, where she uses her own experience to make sure patients fully understand the potential risks. She explained: “I was never told about risks or complications, so I want to make sure that the patients who come to me understand exactly what will happen before I put that needle in.    “If you don’t explain to them that there may be complications, and that hyaluronidase, which they would need to dissolve the filler, is very expensive – plus there is currently a shortage in many parts of the world, so not every doctor has easy access to it – then you are leaving them vulnerable. “The NHS shouldn’t have to be dealing with people going to AE with complications like occlusions, when blood vessels get blocked, but the dficulty is that people aren’t told the risks and so don’t know what to do. “It’s also really important to give people a cooling off period, so they have  hours to go away and think about whether, now they have all the information, they actually want to go ahead. It’s not right to do it there and then, as they can feel pressured.” Sarah has expressed concern about the rise in people with no medical training injecting filler into their clients. According to a  statement by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons , dermal fillers remain unregulated in Britain, meaning “anyone wielding a syringe can order them off the internet” and the procedures are often performed in unsterile, non-clinical environments.

Paige Hoyle, , grabbed Victoria Wynn by the hair and punched in the face up to five times in a street brawl, started after Hoyle hurled a bottle at the victim. The victim needed treatment for nerve damage and swelling to her face. A court heard Miss Wynn, who is in her s, huddled her sobbing child and begged for mercy - but Hoyle, herself a mother-of-three, retorted: Who the f*** are you  and promptly subjected her to the vicious beating. But judge Recorder Matthew Corbett-Jones stressed violent Hoyle has responsibility of three young children and spared her jail.    Sentencing the lout to a -month community order at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, the judge said: This was a sustained and repeated assault. You had consumed alcohol and there is an ongoing impact. This took place in the presence of a child. You started this incident and had it not been for your actions, this simply would not have happened. She would not have sustained her injuries. It is apparent you were in a state of turmoil because of events in the past, which led to a falling out with your father. You have had subsequent traumatic incidents in your le and you do have responsibility of three young children. The judge made his decision after Hoyleaposs lawyer argued the defendantaposs kids aged six, four and nine months depended on her and claimed it was not in the public interest to send her to prison.    Harriet Johnson, defending, said: She does show unusual insight into the impact this will have on the woman and child. She has three children aged six, four and nine months of her own who depend on her. However, they will not in anyway get her out of jail. She has made arrangements in respect of them and she knows custody is inevitable. She doesnapost seem to rely on the children to keep her out of prison. She knows she must be punished for what she has done and she reacted wrongly. But there is a keenness to engage with probation and I would submit it is not the best thing to send her to custody, as it is not in the public interest. She is in receipt of benefits. She has suffered financially also.  But Hoyle, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, faced up to five years jail after she admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The fracas happened after the pair left a New Yearaposs party in Rochdale. The defendant had become involved in an altercation with her partner and partneraposs dad moments before the rage.

Kayana Vasquez first came across her partner, Mike Krupka, during a store opening for Burger King franchise Tri City Foods in Minnesota, US. At the beginning nothing romantic occurred between Mike and Kayana, who was just a teenager at the time. The pair spent many hours in the fast food outlet together and got to know each other well. The brakes were put in their fledgling relationship however when they were transferred to dferent branches, only to reconnect four years later.    Looking back at the first time she clapped eyes on Mike, Kayana said: We actually met way before we started dating. He was actually my boss. I was  when we met but there was nothing bad going on before I was an adult. Spending time together opening a store gives you a lot of time to get to know someone. You are the only two there so you have to talk to each other or itaposs silent.    “That made us end up connecting outside of work and eventually it turned into a relationship. We have been together for two years and nine months.” Kayana said that Mike had been an overwhelmingly positive force in her le.

Meanwhile, Mike said Kayana had given him hope in love again and a reason to care about things. Kayanaaposs parents are still not supportive of her relationship with Mike, but the -year-old has learned to accept that not everyone will embrace them with open arms.    She said: In so many ways. I was totally insecure before our relationship and he has helped me improve so much. Still not perfect, but getting there. It also helped me realise how judgemental people are and who to stay away from. “Not everyone is supportive. Iaposm the younger one and obviously my parents at first thought heaposs just using me, trying to get something out of me. “Itaposs gotten better, but they will never support it.” For Kayana, their age gap is a positive rather than a negative - allowing them to understand their respective generationsapos perspetives.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da98c1ca3e9a5.80841723.jpg ","title":"gap talk irks winger declan mcdaid as dee seek wins","story":"Dundee attacker Declan McDaid insists any talk of the league being over after their derby defeat has only served to spur them on.The Dark Blues lost - to city rivals Dundee United at the end of August to open up a gap of seven points at the top of the Championship.Some had written off the Dee that night and made the Terrors favourites for the title.However, ahead of tomorrow’s meeting with Partick Thistle at Dens Park, McDaid has sullied such talk and insists they are only focused on winning back-to-back for the first time in the league this season and pushing up the table.“It was never over,” the former Partick and Ayr United man said.“People keep saying that ‘gap’, what was it seven points  We were four games in!“This league is never over that early and we weren’t even thinking about anything to do with that.“We were just trying to get our results right, which we have been.“We just need to keep that up and see what happens.

We’re looking forward to a hard game.“Arbroath was a big win for us and we’ve had the wee break so we’re recharged.“Training’s been at a good tempo and boys are back in working hard, getting ready for tomorrow.”On getting off the mark for the season, McDaid said: “It’s massive for me.

to Russia in Moscow and beat San Marino - at Hampden in Euro  qualying Group I.To make his Dark Blue bow was a boost, as he had come so close in the past.Reds boss McInnes was thrilled to see Devlin finally win caps for Scotland and hopes his stopper can add to them and establish himself with the national team in the same way as McKenna, his Pittodrie colleague.McKenna missed out on the last squad, having just ed from a hamstring injury, but having made his debut in March of last year, the -year-old has gone on to win  caps and become a mainstay of the Scotland defence.McInnes said of Devlin’s first two Scotland appearances: “It was two games that were in total contrast to each other.“Steve had indicated in conversations with me that he was going to cap Mikey.“It was a dficult start for him against Russia. The team had to pick themselves up from the disappointment when the game ended.“There was the high of getting his first cap, but then the disappointment of how it turned out.“However, the reaction was good from everyone, including Mikey, against San Marino.“I’m sure that lted Mikey, but it also lted the supporters of the Scotland team.“So it was good that Mikey had a convincing win and it was good he got the opportunity to go back into the team again after losing against Russia.“Certainly he came back in last Tuesday feeling good about himself and rightly so.“To get a couple of caps is great and he will see it now as a chance to establish himself in the national team in the way McKenna has done.”Former Hamilton Accies man Devlin was named in Clarke’s previous two squads, in September and June, but didn’t feature in two clashes against Belgium and encounters with Russia and Cyprus.Last season, after a bright start to the campaign with Aberdeen, he looked set to be handed his Scots debut by Gothenburg Great Alex McLeish in the Uefa Nations League double header with Albania and Israel in November.However, a foot injury sustained during training with the national team meant he missed out.That injury ended up keeping Devlin out for three months last season and after he ed to action with the Dons he struggled to recapture his early-season form.McInnes added: “He got injured away with Scotland and after that he really struggled to get any momentum again.“Mikey is someone who is hungry to get more caps and I’m sure the two caps he’s had will help that in terms of trying to get into future squads.”Devlin’s two caps were contrasting encounters.In the first, against Russia, he was up against prolic Zenit St Petersburg striker Artem Dzyuba, who scored twice as Russia thrashed the Scots -.But three days later, at Hampden, Devlin was rarely tested defensively against minnows San Marino.McInnes believes Devlin will feel the benefit of both games in his future development.He said: “Whether you see it immediately or not, I think you always get a benefit from playing with your national team.“Whether it’s a good experience or a bad experience, I think it makes you better.“He’s had to play against Russia and be asked the question a lot by a physical striker and then play against a team in San Marino where he didn’t have a lot to do defensively.“It was more about his use of the ball, which was good, as was his concentration. Mikey has sampled two dferent ends of the spectrum in international football and it’s pleasing he managed to deal with that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.35711096-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.35711096-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.35711096-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.35711096-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen road closed to allow lorry to be recovered","story":"An Aberdeen road has been closed following a lorry breakdown.Officers have urged drivers to avoid School Road in Seaton to allow the heavy goods vehicle to be recovered.A tweet from police said: #School road, Seaton will be closed for a short time whilst a broken down HGV is recovered.#Please avoid the area for the time being.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5da0aa4eef9f61.66247159-391x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet jeff theo and gypsy are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This little bundle of energy may look cute, but he will be quite a bit of work for a new owner.Jeff, who is eight months old, is friendly and full of mischief, but has had no training and will need someone to start from scratch with him, including his toilet training.Jeff had been suffering from #cherry eye# but this has now been sorted by vets and hopefully won’t cause further issues.This handsome puss is quite an independent boy.Theo does enjoy cuddles, but only on his terms.The kitty, who is  months old, has been an indoor cat previously but he is really keen to get out, so he’ll need a new owner who is able to give him access to do this.

But he insisted there was also much to be positive about.“We know we played well and what we have to fix,” he said.“So it gives us something to build on as we prepare for our away fixture against the Pirates this Saturday.”The Paisley outfit will be full of confidence after comprehensively beating the Kirkcaldy Kestrels - last weekend.Reynolds also spoke about the new overtime rules introduced this season, rules designed to make sure each SNL match produces a winner.He said: “It certainly made for an exciting end to the game as both teams pushed for a winner and for the first time we saw the introduction of the new v overtime and shoot-out rule in a regular-season game.“We came close to grabbing the winner a couple of times in overtime but the game was eventually decided in the shoot-out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe do not profess to be experts, but the costs involved in renewing  miles of power transmission lines, along with pylons and substation # plus the removal of what was there before # must be astronomical.What would be the problem for SSEN Transmission to look at burying the line passing across the Tarbert isthmus, or even laying a shortof subsea cable under the upper reaches of West Loch Tarbert  It may have been costed based on the published design, but the money involved, relative to the whole project, would surely be negligible.The company states no #formal objections# were received and that it will #do all it can# to minimise the visual impact.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction.

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas. I highly recommend you Youtube it for a bit of light entertainment.The partnership between the two is one I have not seen all that often and you can tell that they really enjoy working together."},{"url":null,"title":"september festival fun for soccer kids","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIt was a busy September for kids from Red Star youths, with teams attending festivals at Haldaneand Lochnell thanks to sponsorship from Ardrishaig Community Trust and Ventient Energy A’Chruach Community Fund.Almost  kids headed off to Alexandria in early September for the popular and competitive Haldane festival playing against new teams from across the West of Scotland.Lochgilphead were represented by teams at , ,  and  age groups with each working hard and testing themselves against some really good teams.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles.

I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain. That was until I saw him in action during rehearsal!ldquoIrsquove always wanted to be an actor and be the bad guy, he said. ldquoI have to put on quite a low voice for my character.

I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it.

Itrsquos my first acting role and Irsquom enjoying being part of a musical theatre group. When all the cast get together for scenes therersquos a great atmosphere.I caught up with George Brydon who is saddling up to play cowboy Will Parker. ldquoI feel very excited to play Will because hersquos a happy-go-lucky sort of guy with some sick moves, and Irsquom looking forward to learning the two-step. Irsquom loving being in Oklahoma. Itrsquos a great show with classic songs.Unfortunately I didnrsquot get the chance to catch all the cast ndash perhaps Ado Annie was too busy to peel herself away from the smooth-talking cowboys!I did, however, sneak a peek at the auction scene being rehearsed.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

fossil fuels, but the new carbon-neutral solution that has been drawn up by scientists could eventually be used to develop a sustainable liquid fuel alternative to petrol.Professor Erwin Reisner and his team have managed to ensure the device does not release any additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.ldquoYou may not have heard of syngas itself, but every day you consume products that were

in plants that harvest sunlight, which are combined with a catalyst made from cobalt.When in water, one light absorber uses the catalyst to produce oxygen, while the other carries out the chemical reaction that reduces carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, forming the syngas mixture.What is more, the articial leaf is able to work just as well on cloudy and overcast days.ldquoThis means you are not limited to using this technology just in warm countries, or only operating the process during the summer months, said Virgil Andrei, a PhD student and first author of the paper, published in the Nature Materials journal.ldquoYou could use it from dawn until dusk, anywhere in the world.He added: ldquoWe are aiming at sustainably creating products such as ethanol, which can readily be used as a fuel.ldquoItrsquos challenging to produce it in one step from sunlight using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction.ldquoBut we are confident that we are going in the right direction, and that we have the right catalysts, so we believe we will be able to produce a device that can demonstrate this process in the near future.Professor Reisner continued: ldquoWhat wersquod like to do next, instead of first making syngas and then converting it into liquid fuel, is to make the liquid fuel in one step from carbon dioxide and water.ldquoThere is a major demand for liquid fuels to power heavy transport, shipping and aviation sustainably.The development of the articial leaf at Cambridge University comes after it was reported previously that scientists were attempting to mimic the way plants harness energy from the sun in order to make a more efficient renewable fuel.Researchers at the University of East Angliaembarked on an pound, project to replicate photosynthesis.Scientists said the process would be used to create hydrogen, which can be used as a zero-emission fuel for cars, or converted into green electricity.It is hoped the method, which involves placing tiny solar  on microbes to harness sunlight and drive the production of hydrogen, will be a more efficient way of converting the suns energy than currently exists.The UEA, who is leading the project, said: \"Reserves of fossil fuels are dwindling and fuel prices are rising, so its really vital that we look to renewable energy supplies.\"Many renewable energy supplies such as sunlight, wind and the waves still remain largely untapped resources.\"Cambridge and Leeds universities were also involved in that project."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-most-sought-after-apartments-help-housebuilder-cala-record-sales","story":"The company said a strong summer performance and a broad range of homes available

My we saidI put the tub in the blue bin Irsquod be doing more environmental harm than good as it could prevent the rest of the rubbish being recycled. I saidthe tub didnrsquot go in the blue bin then shersquod be doing environmental harm as it would end up in landfill.Thus ensued an argument about what could and couldnrsquot be recycled. I thought nearly everything could, my we said very little could. \"Glasgow City Council couldnrsquot be so useless that theyrsquod give us a recycling bin but you canrsquot put a butter tub in it,\" I said. \"Surely, Scotland isnrsquot that rubbish at rubbish \"\"Go and check then,\" my we said. So I did. And she was right.I think - rather, I thought - of myself as pretty smart when it comes to green issues. But Irsquom not. I took for granted that the state had started thinking sensibly about the environment, and thatrsquos allowed me to abnegate a lot of responsibility. My newly discovered ignorance has opened my eyes.I checked with Glasgow City Council and found out that indeed I couldnrsquot put a lot of plastics in the blue bin. No plastic bags, nothing like yoghurt pots and butter tubs, can be recycled. The plastics you can put in the blue bin are plastic drink bottles, sauce bottles, bottles for shampoo and cleaning products. Most other plastic materials like food cartons, tetra packs, or wrappings - they go in your general green bin and head to landfill.This canrsquot be good, I thought. Trash I believed should be recycled is actually going to landfill. And Irsquom putting the wrong rubbish in the wrong bin and messing up the recycling system. How many people are making the same mistakes  How does this affect Scotlandrsquos record on recycling So I got hold of the latest figures from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency on household waste, how much is generated, and how itrsquos managed. The figures are for . As a whole Scotland generated . million tonnes of household waste. We recycled . million tonnes - thatrsquos .%. In the era of climate crisis and increased public concern over the environment, thatrsquos pretty poor.I live right on the boundary between East Renfrewshire Council and Glasgow Council, but Glasgow is my local authority. East Renfrewshire generated , tonnes, and recycled , tonnes or .%. Glasgow generated , but recycled just , - thatrsquos only .%. The worst local authority is Shetland - it generates , and recycles  or .%. East Renfrewshire is the best in the country, followed by West Lothian.To make matters worse, rsquos figures are a decline on the previous year. In , Scotland recycled .%. Glasgow recycled .% last year. East Renfrewshire recycled .%.Like most families, we try to recycle as much as we can - we compost food waste, we never use plastic bags. But the system is confusing. It seems the more the public tries to be green, the less impact wersquore having and the worse the state does to match our efforts.I spoke to the Scottish government and was told everyone has ldquoto play their part, ldquoreducing waste is important, families need ldquoto think about what more they can do, that the government ldquowill do our bit to pick up the pace of progress. The country exceeds ldquothe EU target set for  relating to biodegradable municipal waste. Itrsquos also ldquogood news that wersquore generating less household waste than before, and that combined we recycle and compost more than we landfill.Still, it all felt a bit amorphous, so I tried local government. One senior staffer working on the environment said privately, \"Itrsquos definitely not good.\" Glasgow City Council said that although therersquos been an ldquooverall drop in national recycling rates, the local authority ldquofully accepts that improving the cityrsquos recycling performance has been challenging.To be fair to the council, itrsquos replacing , old steel bins across the city, and thatrsquos seen an increase in recycling of % at homes with new blue bins. However, a simple public information programme would be a quick fix ndash telling idiots like me exactly what can and canrsquot be recycled. Email it to residents. Put the information on all new bins.Glasgow Council, however, also pointed to one of the key problems: the business model behind the recycling industry. The council is ldquofinding that the marketplace for recyclable material is increasingly testing.What goes in your blue bin really depends on the market. If therersquos a market to recycle something then it will get recycled. If not, itrsquoll more than likely end up in landfill. Some % of UK councils say theyrsquove experienced problems with the plastics market.Those plastic drinks bottles  Well, therersquos a market for them. Only a fraction of plastic pots, tubs and trays have an end market, however, according to analysis by Recoup, the recycling charity.The market must not be allowed to dictate recycling policy. The state either needs to intervene to provide adequate recycling facilities, or enter into discussions with the industry to improve the service given to the public. Retailers and producers should also bear responsibility -they create waste, they need to help clean it up.However, the pubic also needs reminded that there are reasonable limits to what the market can do as well. Councils complain thatwe put rubbish in recycling with food on it, then wersquore wasting our time. Recycling systems canrsquot handle it, so plastic with food waste - like the wrong plastic in the blue bin - could be rejected.The problem is communication. No-one is talking properly to each other - public, councils, business, and government. We need information on what the market can do, the state must fill in the gaps, and the public needs clear advice. That way we can all play our part, the environment will be prioritised, and families wonrsquot end up at war over recycling a butter tub.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the

Cycling Scotland, Cycling UK, Forth Environment Link, Living Streets, Paths for All, Ramblers Scotland, Sustrans Scotland and Transform Scotlandrsquos six point plan said journeys on foot, bike and public transport should be prioritised over cars, to help tackle inequality, reduce carbon emissions and improve health and wellbeing.As well as an end to government investment in the creation of new trunk roads, theorganisations have made a number of what they believe are progressive suggestions for the way forward.They include: taking space from private vehicles to make more room for walking and segregated cycling investing in affordable and integrated public transport and ensuring all housing, commercial and retail developments include measures to promote ldquoactive travel in any new proposals.They go on to suggest supporting ldquobehaviour change programmes which encourage active and sustainable travel and improving access to bikes.Sustrans deputy CEO John Lauder said the new National Transport Strategy rightly highlighted the role transport can play in health and wellbeing.ldquoWe know that walking, cycling and public transport are best placed to deliver the aims of the new strategy, and these six priorities should be the focus to make it a success, he said.ldquoThis includes an end to expensive new road building schemes in order to tackle the climate emergency ndash this money can be better spent on sustainable, healthy alternatives. Clara Walker, executive director of Forth Environment Link, said the better the transport options, the more likely people were to leave their vehicles at home.ldquoBy continuing to strengthen our National cycling and walking ambitions we will not only see improvements to our environment but also to public health, she said.ldquoBy increasing opportunities and funding for cycling and walking alongside improvements in the public transport network we will support our communities to make affordable and informed choices around how they travel.ldquoThose particularly in rural communities who experience higher public transport costs, will be able to look at multiple modes of transport as a real possibility and leave the car at home.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, called for ldquobold leadership and culture change as part of a rethinking of investment in transportation in Scotland.He said: ldquoItrsquos essential that these are more than wise words in a wellcrafted strategy.The Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed National Transport Strategy sets out the vision for transport in Scotland for the next  years.It includes a ldquosustainable travel hierarchy, which is the system by which dferent modes of transport should be prioritised.

The objections donrsquot apply to them, of course. But superhero films, as the directors Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Ken Loach recently complained, are not so much Juvenal as juvenile.As with all debates these days, itrsquos become intemperate: Scorsese merely said that Marvel films, while ldquofun and good in the way an amusement ride is, were not ldquomy kind of thing Coppola claimed they were ldquodespicable Loach, naturally, thinks that they are a ldquocommodity cynically made for ldquogiant corporations to make a profit.Naturally, since Loach thinks that about everything, from cars to clothes to chicken nuggets everything, that is, except his own film, which always heroically depicts the working class being shafted by the capitalist system, and is presumably produced in order to lose money, since profit is such a bad thing.The only puzzle is how hersquos managed to make around  versions of it and become the most successful director in the history of the Cannes Film Festival without making any money.The truth, of course, is that you would have a better chance of a percentageon your money on a Ken Loach picture than by sinking it into a tentpole blockbuster. Itrsquos certainly less risky: I, Daniel Blake, about a man who dies after his benefits are stopped , brought in  million at the box office alone no one knows quite what it cost, but probably less than pound million, and about a quarter of that was given to Loach in government grants and tax breaks.By contrast, X-Men: Dark Phoenix cost  million, and is expected to lose about  million overall. But thatrsquos capitalism for you, cynically pursuing profit by funding heartbreaking socialist narratives of neoliberal oppression, while throwing money down the stank to bring you Sophie Turner and Jenner Lawrence as sexy mutants in spandex.As it happens, I think Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, Coppolarsquos The Conversation and Loachrsquos Kes are better films than Joss Whedonrsquos Avengers Assemble . But this is not an especially controversial view. There is a tendency, in all the arts, for some work to be marked as ldquoserious and lesser work as ldquoentertainment.High art is better than low art, but the genre ision is nonsense. Those ldquoserious films are genre films, too: Goodfellasare gangster movies, The Conversation is a paranoid conspiracy theory, like Tony Scottrsquos blockbuster Enemy of the State, and Kes is a coming-of-age tale. These are all forms as established, and with rules as clear, as science fiction, Western, war, horror, rom-com or superhero pictures.ldquoLiterary fiction, of the sort that makes the Booker prize shortlist, is as much a genre as space opera or detective fiction indeed, it sometimes is one of those, even when it wonrsquot admit it. Margaret Atwood used to protest furiously that she didnrsquot write science fiction .The ldquoliterary quality of Iain Banksrsquo ldquomainstream books is not notably dferent from Iain M Banksrsquo science fiction. The fact that William McIlvanney and Ian Rankinrsquos subject is crime and detection does not impede their reception as serious fiction. If Cormac McCarthy is a better writer than JT Edson, they are nonetheless both authors of Westerns. Donald E Westlakersquos thrillersare recognisably in the same vein as The Count of Monte Cristo or works about revenge by the likes of Euripides, Webster or Shakespeare.New forms of consuming media have led to much wider availability of every possible form of art ndash think of whole TV channels devoted to classic film, instant access to almost any music on streaming devices, and the digital reproduction of the entire history of Western visual art.Itrsquos also led to catholic tastes and surprising crossovers: Philip Glass creating symphonies from David Bowiersquos rock music modern retellings of classic novels new visual responses to classical painting postmodern architecture period films with pop soundtracks .Itrsquos rather a shame that it hasnrsquot led to a reduction of the snobbish tendency to cram things into genres to be elevated or deplored, when the best works of art are about breaking out of, or transcending, such categories.If Aeschylusrsquos Prometheus Unbound is greater than Kenneth Branaghrsquos Thor , itrsquos not because of the subject matter: theyrsquore both tales of gods and heroes."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A happy day for equality  but a sad day for the Union","story":"The reason for breaking the shameful deadlock that has put democracy on hold for three years was not to pick up business where they left off, nor to attempt to bridge the irreconcilable gulf between warring parties, but to block one of the most signicant pieces of legislation to be passed in Belfast in years.Pro-choice campaigners, and hundreds of thousands of women across the country, won a victory on Monday.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amHydrogen achievements in Orkney are in the spotlight as the finalists for the Scottish Green Energy Awards  are announced.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back. This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will, in turn, justy the privatisation of most government responsibilties and duties of care going to US companies where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

As a community, we cannot afford to wait until a flock or herd is burned alive before taking action to help the forces of law and order stamp out the Banger Menace. “As a community, we must not be flippant about the threat of fire dangers to barns and bales, especially with the high costs of replacement fodder for the upcoming winter,” said Assemblyman Swann.

Many of her previous publications topped the book charts in the UK and Ireland, some even making on to the prestigious Sunday Times Best Seller list.In her latest publication, the experienced cook s to her roots with wholesome recipes for easy and affordable meals to suit all occasions - from quick mid-week suppers to the traditional family Sunday lunch.For Jenny, food has come full circle, and her wisdom and advice over her long career has always reflected the needs and trends of society.Since the start of her illustrious career, which has seen her present pioneering television cooking shows, appear at events, establish her cookery school and publish extensively, her personal style has evolved and changed dramatically. Jenny describes her cooking style now as more relaxed and healthier, offering great results with less fuss. She has reflected this approach in her new recipes.Fundamentally, Jenny’s guiding principals have remained the same throughout her career. She wants to empower people to create tasty, wholesome food that brings everyone to the table with a smile on their face.“I have taken familiar recipes and updated them with a modern twist drawing on influences and tastes from the full spectrum of the global cuisine,” Jenny says.“There are few people who don’t appreciate the merits of a Sunday roast dinner, a slice of cake and warm, home-baked bread served with a bowl of soup.“My roots are in the country and in my new book I want people to connect with our world-class, local produce and enjoy the bounty of nature all around us while supporting and strengthening our food infrastructure.“I understand everyone is struggling in these uncertain times. We are all juggling busy schedules, domestic budgeting and a healthy diet, so I have created a collection of streamlined recipes for lighter, fresher dishes that are easy to prepare and heartwarmingly delicious and nutritious.”At Home With Jenny features food for all seasons from Valentine’s Day to Christmas and everything in between. It’s perfect for both novice and seasoned cooks with sections covering starters, mains, outdoor cooking and wonderfully tempting sweet treats.Jenny’s experience has taught her the strong connection between a positive, balanced diet and good physical and mental health. In this new book, she is keen to promote the whole experience of a healthy food lestyle.“Food is a great way to bring people together both formally and informally. I am encouraging people to make these dishes and sit down at the table with family and friends converse and enjoy the food. “Every meal is an occasion to connect and what better to do it than over food made with love,” Jenny says.At Home With Jenny features recipes for pizza, fish dishes, steak, casseroles, cakes, salads, and lots more. Seasonal dishes include sumptuous autumnal Roasted Bramley Apple and Pumpkin Soup, as well as warming Crusted Tart with Pulled Brisketand Filo topping - just perfect for winter days.Each dish in this collection has a strong connection to nature and landscape reflecting Jenny’s love of the outdoors which she pursues by surfing on the North Coast and sparking up outdoor cooking at every opportunity – even to make Christmas dinner!It has been four years since Jenny last published a book. In that time, she has been kept incredibly busy with her cookery school in Cullybackey, and appearing at events right across Northern Ireland.Jenny says: “Over the last few years, I have been out of the home kitchen and connecting with people from all walks of le. “This has afforded me a fantastic experience to discuss and find out directly what people actually want when it comes to cooking at home.“Recently, there has been a push-back against the relentless demands of digital technology. Many people find cooking a mindful way of relaxing while nourishing their minds, bodies and souls. People want simplicity and to be connected to how their food is sourced and prepared.“In my new book, I have carefully considered all the important contemporary food issues such as dietary requirements, time and finances and I have put together a simple guide to help everyone make healthy choices that satisfy your appetite for le!”Home With Jenny is available now from jenny@jennybristow and at book signing events throughout Ireland.It is priced at pound.

But for every bad news story about young people, there are so many more good news stories with many youngsters going above and beyond for the great of their own community.One such example is a group of girls from New Lodge Youth Centre who have recently embarked on an intergenerational project with elderly people in local nursing homes and accommodated living.An intergenerational project is one designed to help build better relationships between young and old people as well as tackle issues such as bullying and bereavement.The project also creates learning opportunities for the pupils and the elderly, with young people working one-on-one with seniors and asking questions about their childhood, work, hobbies and le in general.Paul Dynes from New Lodge Youth Centre said the intergenerational project came about thanks to their great relationship with Newington Housing Association.“Basically, the project came about after work between the youth centre and Martin Hamilton from Newington Housing Association, who use our building for ious events,” he said. “They have also provided us with support for ious programmes over the last couple of years. From our work together, it sparked an idea of doing some more things together. It was actually a group of young girls that came to one of our youth workers to express a real interest and want to engage with an elderly home or accommodated living or. as it is better known, some sort of intergenerational project.”The project is now in full swing with the girls spending a couple of hours each week engaging with the elderly.“The first session was all about storytelling, sharing experiences and memories before it progressed to taking part in games and activities to spark such conversations between them,” added Paul.“They were able to build up relationships with each other and started to understand more about each other which was key to the rest of the project. Since then, they have done all sorts of things together such as baking and other fun-based activities.“They have recently decided to go on to do a shared-art piece where they will create fashionable dresses to show the evolution of fashion over the years to the modern day.”Paul is now hopeful the project will be something other communities can take note of in order to break the stigma of some young people and elderly folk’s opinions of each other.“I think the bigger issue is that some young people may have views on elderly people and vice-versa.“Some young people get a bad name by causing trouble or engaging in anti-social behaviour and this type of project helps create an understanding of one another.“There is definitely a need for it within our community and indeed, in the wider society.“If there are people and groups who want to make it happen, it certainly can.“I would like to thank Martin Hamilton , James Begleyand everyone at New Lodge Arts and the Ashton Centre for their work and help in making the project happen.”To get involved with New Lodge Youth Centre, contact   "},{"url":null,"title":"320 workers set to lose jobs at pharmaceutical plant in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

years old reported as being overweightor obese .One of the key messages from the new campaign is that it takes a hero to be the bad guy.It warns that cutting back on treats can be really challenging and no parent wants to say no, but in these situations, children need to be protected -

Professor Read, director of the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, said: “The study showed that the bacterium which causes whooping cough can lurk silently in the nose and throat of even healthy members of the community.“This is extremely important as it explains why we are seeing episodic outbreaks of whooping cough throughout the world, with serious disease occurring in those people who are not vaccinated or who had their vaccines a long time ago.”There were , cases of whooping cough diagnosed in the UK between  and  compared to , between  and  – a four-fold increase, according to UHS.A UHS spokesman said: “Adults suffer a milder form of the disease compared to young children but can still have an unpleasant cough for up to three months, while babies under the age of six months can be vulnerable to severe and le-threatening complications.“Although a vaccine is offered to all babies in the UK – where  have died as a result of the infection since  – it does not offer lelong protection and is now less effective than it was  years ago.“This is why the Southampton discovery is so signicant – it means the bacteria can spread from person to person, silently, and cause disease in those who are not immune, including babies, and those not vaccinated.”The £. million study forms part of a wider £ million European project, PERISCOPE, funded by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation and the Innovative Medicines Initiative , involving experts from  institutions across  countries."},{"url":null,"title":"hairless skinny pigs looking for new homes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A last-ditch attempt to block abortion law changes in Northern Ireland led by the DUP failed, with the law changing at midnight on Monday. Unionist parties, who oppose the upcoming liberalisation, triggered the assemblys recall with a signed petition. Members of the SDLP were also in attendance. But Speaker, Robin Newton, informed MLAs that the Assembly had to elect a speaker and deputies with cross community support before any other business could take place. That became impossible when SDLP leader Colum Eastwood declared he wasn’t willing to facilitate a “unionist talking shop” and led his party out of the chamber. As they made their way out cries of “shame” were shouted by DUP MLAs. googletag.cmd.push As a result of their leaving no nationalist representatives remained, meaning no new speaker could be elected and the sitting was suspended after less than an hour. Jim Allister accused the SDLP of thwarting the formation of an Assembly and said they were therefore thwarting legislation to protect the lives of unborn children. The DUP later walked out, vowing that this was not the end of the matter and they would seek to challenge the law. Mrs Foster said it was a shameful day which would leave Northern Ireland with Europes most liberal abortion laws. They were swtly followed by the UUP after Robin Swann labelled the day’s events a “pantomime” and called on the Secretary of State to consider whether there is any future for the NI Assembly. ‘Pantomime’ Some unionist assembly members had been attempting to introduce the Defence of the Unborn Child Bill , which they hoped to pass by midnight. Two members tabled a Private Members’ Bill in an attempt to halt the Westminster legislation decriminalising abortion. DUP MLA Paul Givan argued the point as to why it should happen having sought legal advice from the Attorney General. The DUP leader Arlene Foster implored the Speaker to share his legal advice with MLAs. However, Mr Newton - who was elected as a DUP MLA - resisted attempts to persuade him to suspend assembly rules to allow the bill to be introduced. Legal advice was sought, he said, and he was content with the guidance provided which is “confidential and privileged”. In July, MPs at Westminster passed legislation which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Irelanddevolution is not restored by  October.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.” googletag.cmd.push Personal best Despite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”  Marty Gallagher Twenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added. Camaraderie Special club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in . Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , . He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city. While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War. Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria. The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century. The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour. Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia. Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion. On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation. The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki. On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs. A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man. The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north. The plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft. Another sixty seconds after detonation the northern sec tion of the city was destroyed and , people were killed. Amongst the casualties were , of the , employees of of the Mitsubhisi arms plant and , more factory workers at ious other sites. These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers. Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage. In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air. “Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation. “We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.” Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war. Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique. Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since . In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki. “After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends! “Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.” The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death. The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until . In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. When he passed away in , aged  Rev Dr Thomas McCurdy Barker was buried at Castlerock in Co Derry.

He was killed aged just  whilst taking part in the dam busters raid in May, .Reporter: Eamon Sweeney::  Oct   addthis, Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II.Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II. William Bolitho, Richards father, was a Cornish commercial traveller in the seed business who stayed on in Ireland after marrying Jane Cuthbertson, the daughter of a local land steward, from Braehead just outside the city. In  the Bolithos moved from Derry to the town of Kimberley in Nottinghamshire where they bought a hotel. Presumably, while his mother and father got the new business up and running, Richard moved in with his aunt Emily who owned a local fruit and vegetable store. But, after her death, William Bolitho sold the hotel and took over the shop. googletag.cmd.push The young Richard Bolitho, an only child, was educated at the nearby Church Hill School and from there won a scholarship to Heanor Grammar School in . He joined the RAF in  but it wasnt until  that he was selected for aircrew training. After qualying as an air gunner Bolitho was posted to an operational training unit where he teamed with five others and they all flew together for the first time on February , . Six weeks later they were all posted to the newly formed  Squadron. Before WWII the British Air Ministry had identied the industrialised Ruhr valley as an important strategic target. The dams along the valley were the valuable source of providing hydroelectric power and pure water for steel-making as well as drinking water and water for the canal transport system in Germany. The belief was that attacks on the dams with large bombs could effectively cripple the manufacturing base heavily prized by the Nazis but at this stage the RAF had been unable to accurately hit hard enough to achieve that aim. It was calculated that a surprise nocturnal attack could work but there was no explosive device capable of achieving it. This is where Barnes Wallis came in. A scientist, engineer and inventor in early  he had begun experimenting with skipping marbles over water tanks in his garden. From this he developed a paper called Spherical Bomb-Surface Torpedo, the idea being that a bomb could skip over the surface of water, avoid torpedo nets and sink directly beside a battleship or a dam and act as a depth charge with the surrounding water concentrating the force of the explosion on the target. Wallis also developed backspin on these devices that would cause the bombs to trail behind the aircraft that dropped it and decreased the chance that the plane would be damaged by the explosion. It also increased the range of the bombs and prevented them from moving away from the target wall as it sank. After initial doubts, the RAF accepted Wallis bouncing bomb for attacks on the Mohne, Edersee and Sorpe dams in the Ruhr valley. Operation Chastise was carried out on - May,  by Squadron  which included Richard Bolitho. Using two spotlights to gauge the correct height, a modied Lancaster Bomber dropped a backspin drum shaped bomb which bounced over the dams torpedo nets hit the wall and spun down to the base before exploding. The Mohne and Edersee Dams were hit and caused catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and the villages in the Eder area. The Sorpe dam sustained minor damage. Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and and several more damaged. Factories and coal mines were also destroyed. The human cost was also catastrophic. Overall, an estimated , civilians- Germans and , mainly forced labourers from the Soviet Union died. By necessity of achieving their aim, one plane flew so low that it hit the sea with the result that its bomb was torn off and scooped up seawater into the fuselage. Another plane was consumed by flames when it ploughed straight into high voltage electricity cables. However, some historians have argued about the levels of success that the raids achieved stating that the dams were repaired in a matter of five months. The head of the RAF, Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought that the entire episode had been harebrained all along later wrote: I have seen nothing to show that the effort was worthwhile except as a spectacular operation. The inventor of the bouncing bomb Barnes Wallis was awarded the sum of pound, for his war work from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. But, because of the loss of so many peoples lives during the raids he donated the entire amount to Christs Hospital School in  which allowed the children of the RAF personnel killed or injured to attend the school. Richard Bolithos last leave from the RAF before what became known as the Dam Busters raid was spent at home in Kimberley, Nottinghamshire where he was joined by his colleagues Flyod Wile, John Kinnear and Albert Garshowitz. Days later, in the early hours of Monday, May   all of them were killed during the raid. Sergeant Richard Bolitho was rear gunner on the mission his Lancaster Bomber was sent out on the first wave of aircraft taking part in the attacks. Their plane went down near Marbeck in Germany after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and were buried at Borken. They were later reinterred at Reichwald Forest War Cemetery. In all,  men in  planes took part in the attacks on the dams- of them died and three were captured. The Derry born Dam Buster is remembered on a war memorial which was first placed at his former school, Heanor Grammar School and later moved to Marpool All Saints Church in Nottinghamshire when the school closed in . Richard Blothios name is also on the war memorial at Kimberley, the village where he grew up. In May, ,  years after the Dam Busters raids on Germany portraits of all  men painted by artist Dan Llywelyn were unveiled at the Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln and the Dambusters Inn at Scampton in Lincolnshire from where the Lancaster bombers departed. In , three years after Richard Bolithos death, his parents ed to live in Northern Ireland and saw out their days in Portrush. Thirty-one years earlier on November ,  Richard Bolithos grandmother, Jane Cuthbertson from Braehead was buried at Derry City Cemetery having passed away at the age of . Her husband, Robert Cuthbertson was buried with his we having passed away on February ,  aged . Their daughter Jane Bolitho, Richards mother, died aged  on November ,  and is buried with her parents. Her husband William had died  years before her on May , aged  but is buried in his own plot in the city cemetery. Inscribed on the Cuthbertson grave in Derry is: Also their grandson Richard Bolitho, Flight Sergeant RAF VR, Killed in Action, Ruhr Dams,  May, , Aged  years.

She said: “For the past number of years, Sean Dolans have been working in conjunction with Radius Housing Association and a range of stakeholders to develop not only social housing but also state of the art sports facilities within the site at Piggery Ridge. “The new facilities will include an indoor G facility, further development of the current clubhouse and additional social space that is intended to be used in activities that will also develop language and culture. googletag.cmd.push “Looking at these plans it is clear that Sean Dolans GAC is intent on building a community and cultural hub within the Creggan community. “They should be commended for the sterling and tireless work to date by a small group of volunteers to get the club to this point with a vibrant underage structure which is providing an invaluable service to the youth of the TRIAX area. And quite literally rising out of the ashes into a stronger, more resilient club with first class facilities. “Sean Dolans GAC are always welcoming new members and supporters, and I would urge the community in Creggan to get behind the club to ensure that this development is successful in building a vibrant Gaelic community not just in Creggan, but in this city.

Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven. It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago. At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC. Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people. HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage. “It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”  Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure. Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery. An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially. This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels. Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That has to be the target,” he insisted. “There are six points up for grabs Bohemians are three ahead of us but I think we are two goals ahead of them now. We want to try and make six points upwe can but we know that’s extremely dficult but we’re at home and our home form has been good. “We are playing a team that is competing for Europe on Tuesday night and we need the fans, we need everyone in Derry to muster the effort and energy to come and support us because it would be brilliant and it could be a really good occasion. This is going to go to the last game no matter what andwe want to finish third orwe want to qualy for Europe then we have two games to win. googletag.cmd.push Unusual City’s winning goal was unusual to say the least but for Devine it was a case of his team making their own luck.“I think it started with our aggressive press,” he said. “It started with David Parkhouse pushing really hard to get down the line. Obviously it was a bit of fortune for us but Barry had to be in there, he had to be chasing the ball down. “It was a bit of fortune but over the course of the year we haven’t carried a lot of luck. We have been on the receiving end of some bad luck so we’ll take a win by any means tonight. It’s the first time as manager that I’ve won in Sligo so it’s a big win for me.”Devine and his players celebrated enthusiastically in front of the City fans at the final whistle and the manager admitted that the bond between both parties has been a key element of success this year.“It’s all about the fans,” he said. “You see the players’ response to the players and the players’ response to the fans. There’s a real feel about the club at the minute. People are spending money on a Saturday to come down here and we’re very grateful for that. “We’re very grateful of the crowds we’ve had in the Brandywell this year, we’re very grateful that when we’re - down after  minutes the fans aren’t turning on us and they keep encouraging us and keep singing. “It’s all about the fans, it’s all about getting this club back to where I believe it can go. “There will be nobody happier to see us land in Europe this year but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry City captain scored the winning goal against Sligo Rovers on Saturday night to pout his team on the verge of a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for a team which finished in eighth place in the Premier Division last year.A solitary point against St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell tomorrow night would seal the deal for Derry City and McNamee admitted that all focus is now on getting the job done. “We were watching the results on Friday night and saw that Pat’s slipped up a wee bit so and we spoke about that before the game because it was a good chance to put a gap between us,” he stated. “We need just one point now from the last two games so we’ll just focus on ourselves because we have a big game on Tuesday night again so it’s about getting ourselves right in the next two days. It’s a quick turnaround but we’ll be ready for it.”McNamee scored only his second goal of the season at Sligo to win Saturday night’s game after goalkeeper Ed McGinty hit it straight at the City captain as he attempted to clear it. For McNamee, it was just about being in the right place at the right time. “The ball was played back to the keeper and I went to put a wee bit of pressure on him but you don’t really expect anything to happen but he more or less kicked it straight at me and I just put the foot out and guided it in,” he explained.“People think I didn’t mean it but I don’t care. The team is going to come before how many goals I get. “This was a big goal which puts us a wee bit closer but whether it’s me or not it doesn’t really “We had a very sloppy start and again another slack goal was given away but credit to the boys again, all season there have been obstacles thrown at us and we’ve always answered. It was a big win and as Decky says, you don’t win too many games down here.”The Candy Stripes can still secure third place with home victories over St. Pat’s and Finn Harps this week with Declan Devine emphatic that his players give everything in these last two games, there should be plenty of entertainment at the Brandywell over the next few days. “Our aim is to win the last two games,” McNamee continued. “If Bohs win their last game it will go down to goal dference but we’re aiming for third place. “At the end of the day fourth place gets Europe so we have got to nail that down on Tuesday night andwe win that and beat Harps hopefully we’ll get third place as well. Obviously our objective is to finish third but next seasonwe’re playing in Europe no-one will careyou finish third or fourth. “The boys in there just don’t give up. You saw tonight again when we went behind we came back. Over the years at Derry whenever you went behind it wasn’t too often you came back again. “There’s a great character in the group and a never say die attitude and that’s all you can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two goals in three minutes from substitute James Doona sealed the points for the Dubliners who now move to just two points behind Derry City in fourth place with one league game remaining.  After a forgettable first half, Derry got the goal the game desperately needed on  minutes when Ciaran Coll raced into the area and as Clarke came out to narrow the angle, he simply rolled the ball across the face of goal for David Parkhouse to slot home his th goal of the season. googletag.cmd.push The game was now more open and it did not take St. Pat’s long to level the game when Ian Bermingham’s shot deflected kindly into the path of Chris Forrester who turned and fired low past Cherrie into the net to make it -. The final  minutes were extremely tense with the game in the balance but Derry came within inches of restoring their lead when Junior released McDonagh on the right and his low ball shot right across the face of goal with no Derry player there to touch it into the net. The Brandywell was stunned into silence however as St. Pat’s scored two goals in three minutes to seal the win. Substitute James Doona, on the pitch a matter of moments, raced clear of the Derry defence and sent the ball past Peter Cherrie who didn’t move as the ball rolled past him into the net. Derry tried hard to respond but they were stunned again when Pat’s broke after Darren McCauley lost the ball in an advanced position and Jake Walker picked out Doona who got in behind again and slotted the ball past Cherrie to seal the win for the visitors.  Teams:- DERRY CITY: Peter Cherrie, Grant Gillespie , Eoin Toal, Ally Gilchrist, Ciaran Coll, Ciaron Harkin , Barry McNamee , Greg Sloggett, Jamie McDonagh, Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, David Parkhouse. ST.

The original production featured footage of the Foyle River, Grianán Fort and other border landmarks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but for Mexico, this has been replaced by stunning new drone shots of the landscapes of Guadalajara – while the voice and words of Dublin spoken word poet Stephen James Smith on the track “This Island” have been substituted by those of Mexican poet, Elba. Eoin said he hoped the piece, which  takes audiences on a cinematic journey, questioning what borders mean to people, would resonate with the people of Mexico. “About two years ago I was working with other artists in Jalisco and happened to mention the Borders project – it seemed to resonate with them – what with the US border and Trump wall - and felt like something that needed to be performed there. We’d also always wanted to perform Borders on a large scale and I already had connections with the Zapopan Symphony Orchestra, so creating this new version just seemed like a good fit. “The original piece with Stephen James Smith focused on the way we live now and how it’s ok to be both Irish and British – so we wanted to do something similar in Mexico. “Luckily, Elba understood and got what we wanted straight away and will perform her own version with us on the night. “The crazy thing about the whole project was the drone shots when I initially looked at them, I thought they were taken in Ireland, not Mexico. We were kind of disappointed as we were expecting cacti everywhere, but the coastal landscapes look just like Donegal.  \"I guess it shows how much this is a global story – how lines are just man made and how this could have taken place on any country on earth.” Supported by the British Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, the pair will perform alongside the city’s Zapopan Symphony Orchestra – a full -piece orchestra - in their biggest gig of the year. This is not the first time Borders has been performed outside the North, with full capacity shows across Ireland, Britain and Europe, triggering a similar response with each audience. “There have been a lot of tears. The reaction so far has been pretty emotional, even most recently, during our Paris performance, which was unexpected.  \"People were seeing things in the visuals that we weren’t expecting, as they were left to interpret in their own way. The tears aren’t from sadness or depression though, but hope. “There’s a real communal feel during the shows with a lot of people fed up with what’s happening in the world - it’s quite beautul really, to be surrounded by a group people who feel the same way as you. He concluded: “I think we’ll get a similar reaction in Mexico,not more so – especially since we’re touching on their own problems and have Elba there to read her more personalised, local poem.” Following Mexico, it’s going to be a busy few months for the pair – performing Borders in Berlin, Toulouse and across Britain. Ryan said: “Next month we’re off to Berlin for the th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by a full UK tour, then in March we’ll be playing at SXSW in Austin Texas. After that, we’re not sure, but it would be amazing to take Borders somewhere like Palestine or North Korea.” Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland, said it was an honour to bring “Borders” to a wider audience. He said: “We’re delighted to support this project and help showcase Eoin and Ryan’s work internationally. “The times we live in can be incredibly isive, especially around the issue of borders, so it has never been more important for work such as this to reach wider audiences. Borders is a mesmerising visual spectacular and creates a world where boundaries just don’t exist physically but can also be metaphorical, and we hope that this message resonates and captivates the audiences in Guadalajara.” Borders will be performed this Friday and Saturday,  and  October, at the Centro Cultural Zapopan, Guadalajara.\",\"keywords\":\"Derry,MExico,Borders,Brexit\",\"articleSection\":\"Whats On\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Two Derry musicians are taking their ground- breaking audio-visual project, ldquoBorders, which began as a non-political reaction to Brexit, to Central America this weekend.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about ghosts in the castle but during his time living there he never heard had any experience of them.ldquoAlthough the premises are licensed for spirits mdash I think they are of a dferent kind, he

in the new year, said Jim.ldquoThese will again be dferent bloodlines as a follow up to the making of a small but very well bred herd.ldquoCrossed with our own native goals they will produce a very tough healthy race of goats capable of yields upwards of two gallons, which is certainly well worthwhile.Jimrsquos present stud goat, Swaffham Salvador, was a reserve champion out of an entry of  goals at the Royal Norfolk Show.Jim has also imported a Soanen male whose dam was a Q Star goat breed champion.His other stud is a British Soanen bred over a gallon of milk with a minimum fat content of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it

As you would expect, the course had become a virtual mud bath by that stage and there was a lot of fallers.Finn Gibney ran well to take th place in the same boysrsquo race, which had a field of  finishers and Ky Murray also did well to take th place out of  finishers in the girlsrsquo race.Masters trialsThe weekend saw the Masters cross-country trials take place at the Queenrsquos playing fields. The weather was almost too good for it to feel like cross country with brilliant sunshine and little wind.The well kept grounds enticed one runner to go barefoot which was slightly disconcerting for the remainder wearing spikes, but maybe that was a tactic to get clear passage as the others were afraid to cause him injury.The conditions underfoot may have been kind, but the course was taxing with four long loops and a few rises and s where tactics played a part.Mark winsIt was no surprise to see Mark McKinstry, from North Belfast, surge into the lead from the go, given his recent form, but it was still impressive to watch how hard he continued to push despite the clear gap.Second overall was Eamon White, from the same club, with Glenn Donnelly, of Acorns AC, in third. As this race was a trial for selection for the NI team for the British and Irish XC International in Southport in November, all were out to seethey could do well enough in their age groups to merit a place.Three EDAC runners were in the mix. Neil Curran ran a great race, going out hard and hanging on mdash a tactic which worked extremely well. He was th overall and fourth in his age category, so stands a good chance of making the team.Martin Willcox, a previous NI team member at the international event, also put his hat in the ring with a gutsy run, coming th and third in his category which should see him nominated to race.Confirmation was not out at the time of writing, but we will keep our fingers crossed for them both. Gareth Reilly was th overall, getting his cross country season off to a solid start.Soggy SaintfieldAs rain swept in overnight and just kept coming, there was the danger of a wash out for the long awaited Saintfield  k, but runners are a resilient lot and so they turned up nonetheless, ready to enjoy the carnival atmosphere laid on by the hardworking members of Saintfield Striders and other coned volunteers.It was no secret that this is a tough route. Described as a challenge, the k started outside the cricket club, rises up into the town, rises again up Main Street and rises yet again after the left turn which takes the runners out into the countryside.Asthat wasnrsquot enough, there are at least three more hills which take their toll, but there are occasional down hills to catch your breath and the biggest compensation of all is the final mile and a half which drops down into the finish.Edie in frontThe pacers were encouraging and the marshals were cheery, so there was plenty to keep runners on track, whether they were chasing a time or just hoping to finish.EDAC had a small, but determined army. First home for EDAC was Edie Carroll, who thoroughly enjoyed the run and finished th overall and eighth female in a time of . which is more than respectable on that course.Kevin Kelly, who has racked up some great racing en route to Dublin Marathon, ran a PBwhich is a real boost in these last couple of weeks of his prep.Clare Carson, also in taper, produced a good time of ..

to -.That victory ensured Downpatrick of a play-off spot and also ped Bryansford into the relegation mire mdash Bryansford won their first meeting at St Patrickrsquos Park - to -.Saturdayrsquos confrontation will be a no holds barred confrontation.Derby affairs between these two old adversaries are always tasty and no quarter will be asked for or given at the weekend.Bryansford will rely heavily on the experience of Davy McKibben, Conor Maginn, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Timmy Hanna, with Downpatrick looking to Gerard Collins, the Turley brothers, Peter and Damian and Jarlath Branagan.Downpatrick received a massive boost last week when Conor McGrady, who was expected to miss the rest of the season, made a remarkably early comeback as a substitute in the game against Bryansford mdash his appearance from the start could be a game-changer on Saturday.Meanwhile, Downpatrickrsquos close neighbours will take on Saval in a Division  relegation play-off, also on Saturday at St Malachyrsquos Park and will act as a curtain-raiser to the ACFL  clash.Saul looked destined a few weeks back to join Tullylish and one other team in Division  next season, but last-gasp victories in recent weeks over Saval and then Darragh Cross on Saturday have given Ronan McCartanrsquos side a leline.Darragh did Saul a favour last Wednesday night when they beat Liatroim, effectively condemning the Fontenoys to Division .Saul mdash in their first season in Division  mdash have a mixed bag of youth and experience, but could well have to beat Saval without the services of the talented Cormac Byrne, out with a knee injury.However, in Cathail Arnold, Lorcan and Ciaran Harney, Pierce Laverty and Rory Mullen they have the players capable of producing the goods when it matters most.Elsewhere, Dromara play St John Bosco tonight in a Division  relegation play-off at Tullylish with the losers joining Glasdrumman in Division  next season.Bright embark on their initial Ulster Club Championship odyssey with a game against Cavan JFC winners Killinkere at Kingspan Breffni on Sunday andthey can replicate the form shown against Aughlisnafin in the JFC final.To complete a hectic weekend, the action s to Pairc Esler on Sunday where the MFC final replay between Kilcoo and Burren takes place with a .pm start..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo recapture Frank O’Hare Cup  ","story":"CILL Chua regained the Frank OrsquoHare Cup at Pairc Esler on Sunday with a relentless and masterful display of controlled football.The hurt of last yearrsquos defeat to Burren was confined to history as the Kilcoo players and supporters celebrated with unbridled joy on the final whistle.All credit to Warrenpoint for playing their part in an intriguing contest that so could easily have gone either way, but they were made to pay for registering  wides over the hour.As expected, Niall McAleenanrsquos side took the game to Kilcoo with real authority and at times threatened to destroy their vaunted opponents.However, you just canrsquot tie Kilcoo down and they steadfastly refused to be dominated for long periods.With just two minutes on the clock Ryan Mallon gave Warrenpoint the lead with a point from play after some patient approach work. The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him.

There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10555612.jpg","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.
