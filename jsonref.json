Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907493.1559065706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a day in the phoenix park it feels like the most peaceful place on earth","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin Zoo in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: James FordeThe sky is still a murky grey when there is a flash of yellow Lycra among the trees, the first sign of the early-morning runners who pound the pavements and grass of the Phoenix Park each day.The park’s famous deer are nowhere to be seen. Soon, Chesterfield Avenue, the spine of the park, yet again becomes a bustling throughway, with lorries squeezing through the main gate cars overtaking cyclists and cyclists overtaking electric scooters.More than 20 gardeners look after the park, arriving at 8am each day. Working here is no chore, says head gardener Meeda Downey: “Different things crop up. It doesn’t feel like you are coming to work at all.“The public are very appreciative too. They come up and tell you what a great job you’re doing. It puts you in a good mood,” she says, though she emphasises that where they can, they leave nature to its own devices to encourage bioersity.Shortly after 10am, the first busload of tourists pulls up in the park, for a welcome break from congested roads. Driver and tour guide Bill Dunne (50) slows, letting passengers take snaps of the Wellington Monument and “ooh” and “aah” at the deer.Dunne, who is from the Liberties, has been slowing down the Hop-On Hop-Off bus for Áras photos and the park’s other attractions for nearly 14 years, but he never tires of it.“Dublin is soaked in history, so it’s not too difficult bringing the ‘céad mile fáilte’ every day,” Dunnes says. His boisterous charm is appreciated by his passengers, who have started referring to him as the “leprechaun on steroids”.Americans are particularly keen on the park, surprised by the resemblance between Áras an Uachtaráin and the White House. Quickly setting them straight, Dunne says: “I tell them the White House resembles the Áras. Ours was built first, and that’s very important.”Three-year-old Lili Deleo, who lives in nearby Chapelizod, visits the park almost every day with her father, Niall Deleo (42), and their dog, Bob.“We just love it here,” says Niall. “She gets to see nature, the deer and play with other kids.” However, he worries that the Office of Public Works’ consultation threatens to “commercialise” the park. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” he believes, though he would prefer less traffic on Chesterfield Avenue.In Dublin Zoo, three-year-old Teddy McCann is restless with anticipation as he waits to see the “big gorilla”. He has been here many times before, says his grandmother, Diane Nelson, but the excitement never wanes.“We usually get him an annual pass for his birthday. He gets the monthly magazine so he gets very excited about coming to see the animals,” she says.Dublin hurler Conal Keaney (36), of Phoenix Park Bikes, has supplied bicycles to visitors for six years. Overseas people come in their droves, though Mr Keaney believes that many more Irish could take advantage of “the beauty on their doorstep”.Despite working long days, he remains in awe of the park: “No day is ever the same. We are meeting people from all over the world,” he says. “To be out here surrounded by squirrels and birds ... It’s a real privilege.”By evening the park has become home to the cricketers in the Phoenix Park Cricket Club, which has used a plot in the east of the grounds for 200 years – one that is the envy of many of their rivals, says Birmingham-born coach Stephen Moreton.“To have this as a place where kids of five or six can enjoy and stay on until they are 85 or 95 years old, as many of our members are, is just wonderful,” he says. “When you are here it feels like the most peaceful place on Earth,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907457.1559063523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"big plans for phoenix park doing nothing was not an option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMax and Molly Rooney playing football in front of Áras an Uachtaráin in Phoenix Park. Photograph: James FordeVisitors to Dublin’s Phoenix Park had been happily motoring along – literally, for the most part – until suddenly they were hit with the news that the 360-year-old park, the largest enclosed park of any European capital city, was facing change.Change to beloved cultural institutions or amenities of any sort is generally deeply unpopular, but talk of funicular railways, driverless shuttles or “road trains” caught many park users like its famed deer in headlights.The Office of Public Works (OPW) is undertaking a strategic review of the visitor experience provided by the park, and such is the public interest, it extended the public consultation period, which had been due to end on April 26th, until Friday, May 31st.While the more ambitious projects, such as the repurposing of the Magazine Fort on Military Road as a visitor attraction – with the possible addition of the funicular railway, the construction of glowing “welcome pavilions” and the expansion of the Ashtown visitor centre – have attracted the most attention, the overarching principle is to improve facilities, OPW chief park superintendent Margaret Gormley says.“The 1,752 acres of the Phoenix Park are cherished by Dubliners and visitors alike, but in some ways it is a victim of its own successes. Some of its infrastructure is creaking at the seams, and the OPW came to the conclusion that to safeguard the park for the future the ‘do nothing’ scenario was not an option.”The OPW wants to redevelop the current Ashtown Demesne cafe as a children’s education centre and build a larger cafe and visitor centre, as well as allowing for extensive car-parking facilities.Magazine FortThe second major project would be the restoration of the Magazine Fort, built in 1736 to store gunpowder and ammunition for British army. The plan envisages exhibition facilities, a shop and cafe, a rampart walk and moat walk, with potential for a funicular railway to pull passengers up the steep hill from Chapelizod Road.“This has the potential to make a connection with the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge at the point where a new bridge will be built across Liffey,” Gormley says, “but also to act as a hub for a historical military trail in this part of the city linking to the Grangegorman military cemetery and Arbour Hill.”The strategic review, drafted by Denis Byrne Architects for the OPW, makes proposals for five distinct areas of the park. In addition to the biggest projects at the Ashtown centre and the Magazine Fort, it proposes a “welcome quarter” at the Parkgate Street entrance, with twin pavilions acting as visitor information centres, which “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle”.At the west end of the park, which takes in Furry Glen and the White Fields, a “bioersity quarter” with an interpretive centre could be developed, along with more toilets and an upgraded picnic area with a possible “organised” barbecue space. Barbecues, although a frequent occurrence – particularly on either side of the largely traffic-free Furze Road – are currently banned in the park.Finally, the strategy considers Chesterfield Avenue, the central traffic artery through the park. This could be dotted with playgrounds and temporary and permanent art installations and outdoor exhibitions, but what will probably attract most attention is the proposal for a “driverless shuttle” bus or “road train” carrying 15 passengers at a time. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line that runs from Heuston Station could also be developed on the north side of Chesterfield Avenue, close to the zoo.Rewilding the parkThere has been some disquiet about the level of intervention proposed and concentration on tourist facilities in the review. The Green Party has called for a move away from construction in favour of “rewilding” the park, so it can remain a natural resource, particularly in a city that needs to promote more high-density living.However, architect Denis Byrne says this is a misconception of the nature, purpose and origins of the park.“The Phoenix Park is a very complex organism certain parts are wild, but certain parts are incredibly ornamental. There is a vast range of landscapes. It was originally a royal hunting park, so even its wilderness was a curated and carefully planned wilderness.”The review document represents “a bit of blue-sky thinking” rather than a “set of rules” for how the park must be developed, he says.In preparation for the review his firm studied how parks have developed in other cities, such as in London, Sydney and New York, while the idea of the funicular railway was inspired by Lisbon and the driverless shuttles are already in use in the Bois de Vincennes in Paris. However, Mr Byrne says, a mobility plan for the park could throw up other innovative ideas.“Who would have thought electric-powered scooters would suddenly be so popular –maybe they’ll be a way of getting around the park.”‘Soulless retail units’Local residents have raised concerns about the more commercial-heavy plans, with the Navan Road Community Council in particular opposing what it says will be “large, expensive, soulless retail units” at the Ashtown and Magazine Fort centres, which will require “an abundance of car-parking spaces”, it says. “Once areas of the park vanish under concrete they can never be returned.”The OPW shares the concerns about traffic in the park, Gormley says, and would like to develop more sustainable transport options such as the shuttle buses and, eventually, a station, but she says in the short to medium term, given the size of the park, and its use as a commuter route, traffic needs to be managed rather than eliminated.She stresses that the bioersity of the park will remain paramount. “There are no plans to change the ethos or the ambiance of the park, but you can retain those aspects and have good-quality toilets.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3908230.1559136276!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"central bank chief urges government to run budget surpluses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCentral Bank of Ireland Governor Philip Lane. Photograph: Tom Honan for The .Central Bank of Ireland Governor Philip Lane has warned that fiscal discipline must be maintained while the economy is running hot to avoid the need for spending cuts and tax increases when it slows down.Speaking today around the launch of its annual report, Mr Lane said that the economy, while performing well, was still vulnerable to a range of risks. “Given the uncertainty around a number of risks, both domestic and international, it is right that we take a prudent approach and build resilience into the financial system. “In parallel, our advice to the government is to run sufficient surpluses during phases of good economic performance, in order to enable counter-cyclical fiscal measures in the event of a future adverse shock. The key to avoiding damaging austerity in a downturn is maintaining fiscal discipline during upswings,” he said.Mr Lane’s comments came as he announced the financial regulator’s anuual results for 2018. The Central Bank recorded a profit of almost €3 billion in 2018, with €2.38 billion of this figure set to be returned to the exchequer.Tracker mortgagesHe also said its work on the tracker mortgage investigation was nearing completion. “Our latest update shows that €647 million has been returned to 39,800 affected customers, while enforcement cases against the six main lenders are ongoing,” he said. Mr Lane emphasised the importance of tackling the Irish banking system’s high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs). “A high unresolved stock of NPLs constitutes a financial stability risk in the event of a future adverse shock: reducing NPLs - while maintaining protections for borrowers - is essential.”He said that the bank remains focused on Brexit, even after the immediate threat of a hard exit by the UK was averted at the end of March. “We will continue to analyse and work to mitigate the risks posed to the economy, consumers, the financial system and the regulatory environment,” he said.Mr Lane also paid tribute to the staff and of the Central Bank as he prepares to depart for the chief economist’s role at the European Central Bank (ECB). He will be replaced in the role here by Gabriel Makhlouf.

Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireFianna Fáil’s Malcolm Byrne has been elminated for the race for a European Parliament seat in Ireland South.He was one of six candidates battling it out for the last four seats in the constituency, after Sean Kelly (FG) took the first slot.Mr Byrne stood at 80,623 votes on the 16th count, just under 9,000 votes behind Deirdre Clune of Fine Gael, resulting in his elimination.A significant portion of his votes are expected to go to his party colleague Billy Kelleher (92,885) but the other remaining candidates Mick Wallace of Independents 4 Change (101,725), Grace O’Sullivan of the Green Party (93,123), Liadh Ní Riada of Sinn Féin (91,839) and Ms Clune (89,743) will all hope to pick up some transfers.In Midlands North West, Fianna Fáil’s Brendan Smith was eliminated on the 12th count where he stood at 68,677 votes, 1,246 behind Independent candidate Peter Casey (69,923).On the previous count, the Green Party’s Saoirse McHugh was eliminated in Midlands North West.Counting resumed in both centres on Wednesday.Sitting Fine Gael MEP and former GAA president Seán Kelly has already been elected, describing his poll-topping performance as “probably the greatest moment of my political career”.Mr Wallace said that he was “amazed” at the reception he received on the doors had translated in to votes. He believed his “talking straight” persona resonated with voters.Mr Wallace admitted he was not very familiar with the transfer system, having only been in count centres for his previous elections for a few minutes.Mr Kelly received 119,444 first preference votes but had to wait an excruciating 24 hours to cross the finish line from the announcement of the first count results.Fine Gael’s Andrew Doyle and Labour’s Sheila Nunan were eliminated in the 15th count.Midlands North WestIn Midlands North West, Independent MEP Luke Ming Flanagan is currently the closest to the finish line with 112,760 after count 12, followed by Fine Gael’s Maria Walsh on 96,163 and Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy on 91,396.Green Party’s Saoirse McHugh was eliminated on 61,957 on count 11. Although she did not win a seat, the arrival of Ms McHugh on the political scene was one of the stories of the election.The 28-year-old first-time candidate had unexpectedly came third in Friday night’s exit poll.The Achill Islander emerged as one of the stars of the campaign after her break-out performance on a televised debate when her put-downs of candidate Mr Casey won her plaudits.On Monday, Ms McGuinness was the first of 13 Irish MEPs elected. The 59-year-old sitting MEP, first elected to the European Parliament in 2004, received 134,630 first-preference votes, exceeding the quota by some 16,000 votes in the four-seater constituency.Ms Walsh, a former Rose of Tralee, took more than 6,000 of Mairead McGuinness’ first preference vote.DublinOn Tuesday, Independents 4 Change TD Clare Daly and Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews book the final two MEP seats in Dublin.Ms Daly secured the third seat on Tuesday with a final total of 87,770 votes and Mr Andrews the fourth seat with 68,952.Green Party candidate Ciaran Cuffe and Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald took the first and second seats respectively on Monday.Sinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan was eliminated from the Dublin European Parliament constituency after the 15th count.Ms Daly said she was “gobsmacked” by the response she received “from every corner of this city”.“I see Brexit as a disaster for this island. You don’t have to study it to understand what a negative impact it will have. But if Brexit does happen I’m ready to serve in the European Parliament.”He said he understood there were more than 50 MEPs across the EU in a similar situation to his. Mr Andrews said there was confusion around how the electoral counts would work for those in “cold-storage” and said it was time for an electoral commission.Local electionsAll 949 seats have been filled in the local elections, with Longford County Council finally declaring results after four days of counting on Tuesday. The Green Party was the big winner having recorded its best election results to date while Sinn Féin was the big loser. Sinn Féin lost seats on councils all over the country – and was wiped out on some local authorities – in a big reversal of fortunes compared to the last such elections five years ago.The party has seen its councillors fall from 159 in 2014 to 81.Electoral CommissionFianna Fáil TD and aspiring MEP for Ireland South, Billy Kelleher, has called for an ongoing Electoral Commission that would continuously monitor the system.He said that the low turn out in some areas meant that local authorities are not representative of the people “they are supposed to represent,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Mr Kelleher, also questioned the issue of the criteria by which candidates are deemed eligible. He warned that in the future there could be a situation where there are “40, 50 or 60 people on the ballot”.He said it suits the political system if there is a low voter turn out. “Why increase voter turn out if you’re winning on a lower turn out. There is a vested interest to leave it as it is.”An Electoral Commission could look at the best international options. “Even in the third world they have electronic voting.”He pointed out that there was “seven tonnes of paper” in the count centre in Cork.Mr Kelleher also raised the issue of the length of time it takes for votes to be counted under the present system. “We need an effective political system. We should make it easier to get into the polling booth.”There is an inherent distrust by the public of politicians making decisions on such issues, “that’s why an Electoral Commission should handle the issue,” he said.The volume of deliberately spoiled votes in the European election needs to be examined and explained, he added.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3908067.1559117810!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk labour in i am spartacus moment over alastair campbell expulsion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlastair Campbell speaks to the media outside his home in north London on Tuesday after he was expelled from the Labour Party for  voting for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. Photograph:  Dominic LipinskiPA Wire Alastair Campbell has claimed senior figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s office recommended voting against Labour as support for his decision to shun the party in the European elections grew.Tony Blair’s former spin doctor, a leading campaigner for a second referendum, was ousted from the Labour Party after he backed the Liberal Democrats at the polls.On Tuesday night Mr Campbell said members of Mr Corbyn’s staff were among those who sent “many, many messages of support” for his decision.Hours earlier Charles Clarke, the former Labour home secretary and party chairman, said he also voted Liberal Democrat in the election, while ex-defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said he voted Green, in developments being described as an “I am Spartacus” moment for the party.Speaking outside his north London home, Mr Campbell said he would appeal the expulsion and warned Labour faced “oblivion” unless it clarified its Brexit position. “I think that there are people in Jeremy Corbyn’s office, senior positions in Jeremy Corbyn’s office, who have recommended voting against the Labour Party,” he said. “You can interpret the rules in all sorts of different ways, but one thing I know is I’m not going to leave the party just because some random email comes in telling me that I’ve been expelled.”In a tweet he added: “Among many, many messages of support have been some from Corbyn’s office, shadow cabinet, MPs, union leaders and party staff including one telling me there is a mountain of emails from members who responded to mobilisation email by saying no to campaigning and not voting Labour.”He said it “remains to be seen” whether other members who admitted opting against Labour at the polls would also be expelled.Mr Campbell described his rapid expulsion as “strange” and said “people will inevitably draw the contrast with the lack of rapidity in dealing with cases involving anti-Semitism”.Labour said “support for another political party or candidate is incompatible with party membership” but declined to say whether Mr Clarke would also be ousted.Election drubbingIn a statement, Mr Clarke said Labour “should immediately withdraw its expulsion of Alastair”. The former party chairman, a Labour member for 47 years, added: “I was not aware that Alastair had voted Liberal Democrat in the European election until I heard him say so on television on Sunday evening.“His expulsion from Labour Party membership is a disgrace and only compounds Labour’s current political difficulties. I also voted Liberal Democrat. This was a one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour’s position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit.” Mr Ainsworth – the defence secretary in Gordon Brown’s government – told BBC Coventry \u0026amp Warwickshire: “Having recently voted Labour in local elections, I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life.“I didn’t intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so.”Labour and the Conservatives received a drubbing in the European elections as Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party romped to victory and the Liberal Democrats took the second largest share of the vote.Mr Campbell said Mr Blair, who was Labour prime minister between 1997 and 2007, refused during his tenure to withdraw the Labour whip from Mr Corbyn when he rebelled.“Tony was of the view, no, you’ve got to have dissenting voices around,” he said. He said he was “still in the Labour Party” and would “always be Labour”.Mr Campbell, a key player in the New Labour era, declined to rule out shunning the party again in a snap general election and said it would “depend” on its Brexit policy.Labour rules say members who support a party other than Labour are automatically ineligible for membership. Mr Campbell’s expulsion was also described as an “absurd act of political self-harm” by former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay, who announced he had joined the Liberal Democrats on Tuesday morning. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

I am asking to put my role as party leader to the vote, Mr Di Maio, 32, who is also labour and industry minister, wrote on the party’s blog.“I call for a vote of members…on my role as political leader because it is right that you are the ones who express an opinion. If something needs changing within the movement, we’ll do it.”The quietly-spoken Mr Di Maio, whose jobs prior to entering politics included selling drinks at Napoli football stadium, has been totally eclipsed by the rambunctious Mr Salvini since the coalition came to power last June.Cartoonists in the Italian press portray him as an eager lapdog waiting on the every need of the League leader, who is portrayed in a black shirt and tasseled fez – symbols of Fascism.The League has seen its support soar after Mr Salvini ordered the closure of Italian ports to NGO vessels that rescue migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean.If Mr Di Maio is voted out, it is not clear who would replace him.But in any case, Five Star is on the back foot.Mr Salvini has for months behaved as if he is prime minister, elbowing aside not only Mr Di Maio but also the actual prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, a former lawyer who was chosen as a neutral mediator between the two very different coalition partners.There is widespread speculation that increasing tensions between the League and Five Star could lead to the fall of the government and fresh elections, possibly in late September.Please review our commenting policyRobert Mueller: I did not clear Trump over obstruction crimeEnergy drinks risking potentially fatal heart rhythm disruption - but it\u0026#39s not the caffeine, scientists findBritish supermarkets admit their olive oils could be killing birds as they pledge to switch brandsComment: Pompous Bercow\u0026#39s self-indulgent Remainer antics have ruined the dignity of his officeComment: Betrayed Brexiteers are a bigger threat than revolting Remainers in battleground marginals Audio Briefings: Sign up to our new WhatsApp groupSuffolk pub landlord helping tame Tower of London ravens in bid to stop practice of clipping wingsUS reels from most serious series of tornadoes in 40 yearsGoogle Maps increases risk of developing Alzheimer\u0026#39s, expert warnsNational Gallery £3.6m painting went on display in women\u0026#39s prisonPakistani man murders HIV-positive wife after accusing her of having an affairJohn Cleese claims London is \u0026#39no longer an English city\u0026#39 and sparks fresh criticismHells Angels motorbike club banned by the NetherlandsEscaped raccoon dogs causing chaos in village as police urge people to call 999Facebook removes accounts originating from Iran that targeted Princess EugenieMay and Corbyn are now the most unpopular PM and opposition leader duo of all timeUK fails to back international agreement on reducing drug costsComment: The legal harassment of Boris Johnson reeks of Remainer despotism‘No self respecting climber would call that climbing’ -  readers on Everest ‘carnage\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000198700716_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"gross violation uk must demand end indonesian militarys invasive","story":"Indonesia is struggling to increase the number of female recruits to its security forces Department for International DevelopmentThe UK government has been urged by human rights campaigners to make aid and increased trade with Indonesia conditional on an end to degrading “virginity tests”.For decades, women applying to Indonesia’s military have been subjected to the invasive practice in the belief that it will establish whether they are sexually active – and therefore if they are “moral” and “worthy of office”. The “two finger test”, in which medics check whether a woman’s hymen is still intact, has no basis in science and is used as a humiliating threat to keep women from progressing in the country\u0027s security apparatus. The issue is being raised as the UK Department for International Development (Dfid) and the Department of Trade move to expand relations with the fast growing south east Asian state.Dr Meghan Campbell, deputy director of the Oxford Human Rights Hub and law lecturer at Birmingham University, told The  that the UK should “strenuously advocate” for an end to the practice.“Virginity testing is a gross violation of a woman’s right to equality,” she said. “It reinforces stereotypes that a woman’s moral worth is exclusively connected to sexual activity… and excludes them from positions of power.“As the UK seeks to position itself as a global leader it should protect the human rights of women all over the world,” Dr Campbell added.Police officers react to riots in Jakarta. Almost 95 per cent of Indonesia\u0026#39s police and military is made up of men“In interactions with the Indonesian government, be it trade, the Department for International Development or any other context, the UK should strenuously advocate for the removal of the test. It can put conditionalities on aid and trade that should require the removal of virginity testing,” she said. Just last week, Indonesia deployed thousands of police and military officers to the streets of the capital, Jakarta, to quell violent protests over disputed presidential election results. The absence of female officers was stark. Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), who has researched the issue for decades, claimed the practice was impacting the military’s performance at home and abroad.Last June, Indonesia was selected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and has since faced calls to improve its poor record on female participation in peacekeeping missions.But last week the Indonesian defence ministry continued to defend the continued use of “virginity tests” when recruiting female officers as a question of “character”.Iroth Sonny Edhie, a chief aide and head of protocol for the Indonesian defence minister, told The  that virginity tests were a central aspect of recruitment.  Firecrackers explode amid violent riots following the Indonesian presidential elections“Basically this value has been preserved since our armed forces was established around 70 years ago.”But pressure has been mounting internationally to abandon virginity tests, with the World Health Organisation and the United Nations calling for a total ban to the practice last October.The agencies said that although the tests are prevalent in at least 20 countries around the globe, including Afghanistan, Egypt and Iraq, there is “no evidence” that “the female genitalia can indicate a girl’s or woman’s history of sexual activity.”Fears are growing about the influence of conservative Islam on the largely moderate society of Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation.HRW first exposed the use of virginity tests by security forces in 2014. Little has changed since – the army, navy and air force still openly subject women to the invasive practice.The tests, which affect women joining the military and formerly police, have no basis in scienceMr Harsono told The  that groups of three to five women go into a hospital room together and are subjected to the test in quick succession. The medic, often a man, inserts two fingers into a woman’s vagina to see if the hymen is intact. “It\u0027s not about the pain, but the trauma of being exposed,” he said. “Most doctors are male, and women are asked to lie down with their legs open. It\u0027s the associated trauma – having to undress completely in front of others, that stays with the women.”“This is unscientific, this is irrational, this is discriminatory against women, this is degrading,” Mr Harsono added.Academic, physical and personality assessments are all part of the military application process. While some reports suggest there are often no repercussions of “failing” the virginity test, it is one of a series of personality assessments used to determine if a woman is “good enough.”“The skill to shoot, the skill to defend your country, is nothing to do with your virginity,” Eva Sundari, an MP in Indonesia’s parliament since 2004, told The .Indonesia post-election protests leave six dead in JakartaThe Indonesian police appear to have recognised there is a problem. “Since 2014, we didn’t do it for a requirement of the police test. To be a policewoman does not depend on virginity,” said Brigadier General Dedi Praseyto, the national police spokesman.However, Mr Harsono alleged that while the practice had ended in the capital Jakarta, it was still taking place in provinces that were “very difficult to control.”The small percentage of female police officers is a challenge in a country which struggles to tackle sexual violence – in 2013 more rapes were reported among Sweden’s 10 million citizens than in Indonesia, which has a population of 250 million, suggesting that many survivors fear reporting the crime.“Women often do not want to report these crimes against them to male officers.”Mrs Budi claimed the police continued virginity tests under the guise of a “reproductive health check.”“The police say that they have stopped virginity tests, but I’m not so sure. The police now say that women need to have a reproductive health check… but I have been told this test still includes a virginity test.”Studies have shown that women can help to calm violent situationsShe added: “I feel sad and disappointed about the practice, yes, because of the assumption that a woman has to be a virgin to be a good woman. This leads to unfair judgments of women.”Sri Rumiati, a retired officer, has been campaigning for an end to the tests in the police force since she realised in 2006 that they only applied to women. When she joined the Indonesian National Police in 1985, she did not question the practice.“At the beginning of undergoing a virginity test, of course it was not comfortable for me, because I had to open the private domain before a doctor,” she told The . “Sad, upset but unable to do anything because this is part of the selection, I just lived with it.”She now maintains that the tests are against Indonesian anti-discimination laws, but has faced opposition from male colleagues.“Many were angry when I questioned the requirements for virginity checks, especially from the health ision that made these requirements,” she said. “There were some people who said I was crazy.”  Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHowever, not everyone who has been subjected to the test is against it. Many female officers see it as a rite of passage, as a test which helps to maintain a quality police force.“Virginity testing is part of the reason that we don’t have many female police officers,” Anindya Restuviani, co-director of campaign group Hollaback! Jakarta, told The .“But it’s complicated, lots of women who are in the police or army think that virginity tests are good. And there’s a mindset that they are superior because they passed the test,” she said.“Virginity testing is just another form of the discrimination women face every day,” she added. “There are many, many reasons it happens but the main problem is the patriarchal culture. Women are perceived as second class citizens, they’re not seen as having the same value as men.”A spokesperson from UK\u0027s Foreign and Commonwealth Office told The :  “The UK is committed to defending human rights. Last week the Foreign Secretary appointed an International Ambassador for Human Rights who will stand up for people without a voice across the globe.“So-called ‘virginity testing’ is cruel and degrading to women forced to undergo it. There is no justification for it. The UK will continue working hard to protect our values at home and abroad.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Department for International DevelopmentRobert Mueller: I did not clear Trump over obstruction crimeEnergy drinks risking potentially fatal heart rhythm disruption - but it\u0026#39s not the caffeine, scientists findBritish supermarkets admit their olive oils could be killing birds as they pledge to switch brandsComment: Pompous Bercow\u0026#39s self-indulgent Remainer antics have ruined the dignity of his officeComment: Betrayed Brexiteers are a bigger threat than revolting Remainers in battleground marginals Audio Briefings: Sign up to our new WhatsApp groupSuffolk pub landlord helping tame Tower of London ravens in bid to stop practice of clipping wingsUS reels from most serious series of tornadoes in 40 yearsGoogle Maps increases risk of developing Alzheimer\u0026#39s, expert warnsFive Star Movement to vote on whether to ditch leader Luigi di Maio as Italian coalition fracturesNational Gallery £3.6m painting went on display in women\u0026#39s prisonPakistani man murders HIV-positive wife after accusing her of having an affairJohn Cleese claims London is \u0026#39no longer an English city\u0026#39 and sparks fresh criticismHells Angels motorbike club banned by the NetherlandsEscaped raccoon dogs causing chaos in village as police urge people to call 999Facebook removes accounts originating from Iran that targeted Princess EugenieMay and Corbyn are now the most unpopular PM and opposition leader duo of all timeUK fails to back international agreement on reducing drug costsComment: The legal harassment of Boris Johnson reeks of Remainer despotismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/11/TELEMMGLPICT000168998916_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwvkV6XTHOLaZwP-2f_zGabuGDFIrKF9eywxSWQ9UBzU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"john cleese claims london no longer english city sparks fresh","story":"The actor John Cleese has sparked an online row after claiming that London is no longer an English city.In a Tweet sent early this morning to his 5.6 million followers, the Fawlty Towers comedian repeated his 2011 claims about the capital.Cleese, 79, said that virtually all of  his friends living abroad agreed with his observation.He wrote: “So there must be some truth in it.I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EUBut the comedian has come under fire for his renewed comments.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan responded to Cleese\u0027s comments in a statement to the Press Association.Referring to Cleese\u0027s comedy series Fawlty Towers, he said: These comments make John Cleese sound like he\u0027s in character as Basil Fawlty.Londoners know that our ersity is our greatest strength. We are proudly the English capital, a European city and a global hub.Other comedians jumped to criticise the Monty Python star on Twitter.Dom Joly, 51, said: “John Cleese is one of my comedy heroes … Suddenly this thing came out of nowhere and it’s so depressing on so many levels.He’s clearly a really smart funny man but it is basically a very racist tweet. Secondly, it’s a racist tweet by a man who lives on a Caribbean island – the irony of that is insane. Even the language is insane, who uses the word opine?”The Monty Python actor also said last year that he was disappointed with Britain, and announced that he would be relocating to the Carribean instead in protest over the awful debate on Brexit.“I’m leaving in November. I actually am leaving. I am making arrangements now. “I am so disappointed with so much about this country at the moment and I just think so much of this country is disappointing, Cleese said in interview with Newsnight in 2018.Author and columnist Caitlin Moran added to the Twitter conservation.

This is when the flying feathers are cut back so the flight of birds is hugely limited.Last year, Mike Keen, who runs The Boot pub in Suffolk, took his beloved raven Grippe, who does not have clipped wings, to meet the ravens at the Tower as part of a breeding programme.The trip was arranged after he spoke to Chris Skaife, the Tower of London\u0027s Ravenmaster, on Instagram. The raven expert said Grippe was the tamest raven he had ever met.Since then, the first chicks in 30 years hatched at the Tower, and have been handed to the care of Mr Keen, 49, who will be taming them.The Boot said in a statement: We are now training and breeding ravens for the Ravenmaster at The Tower of London. The only place outside of The Tower to do so. We\u0027ll be developing a bloodline of gorgeous ravens as well as training them before they get called up for official duties.Mr Keen told The  that ravens can\u0027t be trained like a dog or anything, they\u0027re way too intelligent for that.However, they can be taught to remain on site and not fly away if they are given food and attention when they connect you with safety and happiness and stick with you.The landlord, who is keeping three young ravens in his bedroom, added: Ideally the Tower of London ravens in future wouldn\u0027t be clipped, we would tame them here and get them used to people being around so they always fly back.The ones currently at the Tower aren\u0027t fully clipped, they can still fly, but they\u0027re wild animals so we are giving them the chance to continue being wild and giving them a choice to come back.He is currently teaching the young ravens to fly back to him in the gardens around his pub, under the watchful eye of Grippe, who is frequently seen on his shoulder.They are high-maintenance birds and are currently fed raw liver, scrambled eggs and raw chicken about five times a day. When they outgrow the landlord\u0027s bedroom, he plans to keep them in a high-security aviary fitted with CCTV and alarms.Those wanting to meet Grippe can visit the pub, and Mr Keen added she often hangs around, at a distance.The RSPB has welcomed this change.  Gareth Cunningham, their head of policy said: “For centuries ravens have been associated with myths and superstitions. This has, unfortunately led to ravens being killed or driven off. Towards the end of the 19th Century, in some areas of England, the species was almost extinct, driven to the edge by persistent persecution.“Today the English ravens population is only just starting to recover, and in some areas like the West Country they are beginning to become numerous once more.

The Mississippi River is already approaching all-time records at several Missouri and Illinois communities.The relative quiet in recent years followed the massive tornado that killed 161 people and injured more than 1,100 in Joplin, Missouri, in 2011.The Kansas storm tore through the Kansas City area, spawning tornadoes that downed trees and power lines, damaged homes and injured at least a dozen people. It came a day after violent storms killed one person and injured at least 130 in Indiana and Ohio.People look on as they examine the damaged remains of school in Dayton, Ohio, on MondaySue Taulbee, 71, was watching television in her bed in the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Brookville when she heard an approaching twister.They say it\u0027s like a freight train: That\u0027s what I heard, she said. It was only a couple of minutes, but it seemed like an hour. I just started screaming and my neighbours heard me and said, \u0027Sue! Sue! I hear you! We\u0027re coming! We\u0027re coming!\u0027They pulled her out through a hole in her collapsed home and brought her to a hospital to treat a cut on her head.Mark Duffin, 48, learned from his wife and a television report that the large tornado was headed toward his home in Linwood, Kansas, about 30 miles west of Kansas City.The next thing he knew, the walls of his house were coming down.Mr Duffin told the Kansas City Star that he grabbed a mattress, followed his 13-year-old to the basement and protected the two of them with the mattress as the home crashed down around them.I\u0027m just glad I found my two dogs alive, he said. Wife\u0027s alive, family\u0027s alive, I\u0027m alive.

Soon, Amazon will allow people to ask Alexa, delete what I just said, too.The feature could be a response to increasing concern about what Amazon is doing with the recordings that it takes of people who own its Alexa devices. The company says it collects them to improve the performance of its voice assistant, but reports have drawn attention to the ways that some people could listen in to them.Amazon has always offered the ability to listen to and delete voice recordings, but it requires digging through the device\u0027s settings.The company is also launching an Alexa Privacy Hub which will allow people to learn about Amazon\u0027s approach to privacy and how to change the settings that dictate what information Alexa is collecting.The new feature was revealed alongside the Echo Show 5, Amazon\u0027s new Alexa device which like its predecessors contains a screen.It also has a privacy focus of its own. For the first time, Amazon has added a camera shutter, allowing people to manually cover up the lens inside the Alexa box to stop it taking video recordings.How to listen to and delete Alexa\u0027s recordingsThe new version is smaller and comes at a relatively cheap price of only £79.99. The existing, larger Echo Show costs £219.99.“Since we launched the first Echo Show device, customers have told us that they love asking Alexa to show them things—whether it’s asking for their favourite recipes to cook along with, their shopping list, or music lyrics. With Echo Show 5, we’ve made it even easier and affordable for customers to add a smart display to every room of their house,” said Jorrit Van der Meulen, VP Amazon Devices EU.“The compact form factor is perfect for a bedside table or desk, plus it has a camera shutter for added peace of mind, and new Alexa privacy features that are coming soon to the UK for even more control.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ahead of their final match of the 201819 campaign, the Europa League final against Arsenal in Baku, we give each member of the Blues\u0027 squad a rating out of 10. A shortened pre-season as his arrival dragged on throughout the summer, Sarri hit the ground running, attempted to change a decade-long style and, eventually, provided invaluable minutes to academy graduates Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek - something the fanbase has craved for years. His stubbornness and lack of variety frustrated many, but eventually he adjusted, pushing City mightily close in the League Cup final and leading the Blues to third and the Europa League final. A satisfactory debut season under difficult circumstancesHe arrived with the enormous weight and expectation from his price tag as the world\u0027s most expensive goalkeeper. Yet Kepa settled quickly, making very few mistakes and proving quietly productive with his feet. The incident at Wembley to not accept Maurizio Sarri\u0027s substitution vs Man City was regretful, yet he bounced back and was pivotal in ensuring the Blues won the shoot-out vs Frankfurt to reach the Europa League final. Still a long way to go to justify the price tag and prove Chelsea have a long-term solution, but he\u0027s made a decent startHandled the Kepa fiasco maturely and proved reliable when he stepped in, five clean sheets in eight appearances - about as solid as you can find as a No 2 without the realistic ambition to surpass the No 1No first team appearances, but seemingly slotted in to his role and proved likable in the dressing room. A send-off in Boston in the friendly vs New England Revolution was deservedEmerging as one of the top five centre-backs in the Premier League with little fanfare. Excellent at recovering, efficient with the ball and even able to stroll out from the back, a cornerstone for Chelsea moving forward. Cruelly deniedA season of regression with his place now under serious threat despite signing a new five-year deal. Productive nonetheless with four goals and seven assists, but a liability at times when defending Has impressed Sarri enough to nudge Alonso out of the starting line-up at times, but is yet to fully lock down a starting role.  Has at least proven to be decent competition and coverHas shown signs of decline but still a favourite under Sarri. Starting to show defensive fragility for almost the first time in his Chelsea career and when the side became predictable, his lack of penetration going forward became evidentHas been an option late in games when Chelsea are chasing and can cross well from deep areas, but will surely be moved on this summer with Reece James andor Ola Aina natural squad optionsHas been frustrated at his lack of starts behind Luiz and Rudiger. Has filled in well to an extent when called upon though, but lacked consistencyHas been Sarri\u0027s mind on the pitch and key to the style transition. Very few defenders better with the ball at their feet and for that reason his extension has proven shrewd. Occasional lack of concentration, but that will not change at this stage of his career. One of the few leaders left at Chelsea and was pivotal in stopping this side fully unravel at timesHarshly treated by Sarri, but not a fit for the way he wanted to play, will be fondly remembered after winning everything with the Blues and eventually received the send-off he deservedStarted brilliantly to inspire a new style at the Bridge. But has been treated ridiculously by some Chelsea fans, who have bizarrely booed him at times this season. Responded well in the last few months and appears to have now settled, will play a vital role in the outcome in BakuEmbraced his new, more adventurous role to the right of Jorginho. Added craft to his game and his energy was critical to Sarriball showing promising signs in year one. Injury is a concern ahead of Baku, but he seems set to recover in timeHas not shone much, but always reliable in possession. Just lacks that cutting edge in the final third and has almost no production in terms of goals and assists despite the freedom of his role. Sarri remains a fan and they will try to sign him permanentlyThe Blues youngster was part of the first team squad throughout the season and impressed in the Europa League: brave on the ball and demonstrating excellent positioning - hasn\u0027t played since suffering a back injury in FebruaryFlourished in the second half of the season to show real signs he can blossom into one of the game\u0027s best box-to-box midfielders, scoring 10 goals in the process. Cruelly injured before the Europa League final and will be out for many months with an Achilles injuryScored the late equaliser vs United and won his England place back, but rarely felt like a \u0027starter\u0027, doing little to justify leaving out Loftus-Cheek and Kovacic for long spells. Will need to step it up next season or he will likely be moved onScored 12 goals and made five assists. His strikes against Tottenham and Frankfurt proved especially important and with Gonzalo Higuain and Olivier Giroud blunting the Blues\u0027 attack, he has emerged as probably the best finisher in this squad, supporting the burden on Eden HazardHas not settled at all, looking slow and offering little outside his movement inside the area, he looks set to return to Turin this summer, even if the transfer ban is heldUnable to convince Sarri he was worth a permanent role to spearhead the side\u0027s attack, yet always proving useful when called upon, especially so in the Europa League, where he became the top scorer in the competition with 10 goals alongside Luka Jovic - deserved a longer run in the side in the leagueSuffered a woeful spell of form and loss of confidence and eventually accepted a move to Atletico in January. Ends his Chelsea career with 24 goals in 72 appearancesHe had to show great patience before a sustained run in the side came, but he justified the hype and showed himself to be worth of starts ahead of Pedro and Willian at times. Quick feet and a refreshing willingness to go on the outside and cross the ball - which would have helped Higuain and Giroud in the closing stages of the season. Will be forced to show more mental resolve to come back from an Achilles injury next season, with his future yet to be clarified entering the final year of his contractA frustrating presence in the side during Chelsea\u0027s predictable spell when sides began to work out Sarriball and also blocked Hudson-Odoi\u0027s opportunities at times. Still provides hard work and neat in possession, but rarely able to provide a cutting edge. Another player with an uncertain future and only one year remaining on his contractOutstanding at times and back to the form to suggest he is the best player in the Premier League, has done enough to earn his move to Real Madrid and will be sorely missed. Without him and his 19 goals and 16 assists, Chelsea would have surely fallen short of top four and been unable to compete with Man City in two of their three meetingsHow did Chelsea\u0027s players perform this season? Ahead of their final match of the 201819 campaign, the Europa League final against Arsenal in Baku, we give each member of the Blues\u0027 squad a rating out of 10. A shortened pre-season as his arrival dragged on throughout the summer, Sarri hit the ground running, attempted to change a decade-long style and, eventually, provided invaluable minutes to academy graduates Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek - something the fanbase has craved for years. His stubbornness and lack of variety frustrated many, but eventually he adjusted, pushing City mightily close in the League Cup final and leading the Blues to third and the Europa League final. A satisfactory debut season under difficult circumstancesHe arrived with the enormous weight and expectation from his price tag as the world\u0027s most expensive goalkeeper. Yet Kepa settled quickly, making very few mistakes and proving quietly productive with his feet. The incident at Wembley to not accept Maurizio Sarri\u0027s substitution vs Man City was regretful, yet he bounced back and was pivotal in ensuring the Blues won the shoot-out vs Frankfurt to reach the Europa League final. Still a long way to go to justify the price tag and prove Chelsea have a long-term solution, but he\u0027s made a decent startHandled the Kepa fiasco maturely and proved reliable when he stepped in, five clean sheets in eight appearances - about as solid as you can find as a No 2 without the realistic ambition to surpass the No 1No first team appearances, but seemingly slotted in to his role and proved likable in the dressing room. A send-off in Boston in the friendly vs New England Revolution was deservedEmerging as one of the top five centre-backs in the Premier League with little fanfare. Excellent at recovering, efficient with the ball and even able to stroll out from the back, a cornerstone for Chelsea moving forward. Cruelly deniedA season of regression with his place now under serious threat despite signing a new five-year deal. Productive nonetheless with four goals and seven assists, but a liability at times when defending Has impressed Sarri enough to nudge Alonso out of the starting line-up at times, but is yet to fully lock down a starting role.  Has at least proven to be decent competition and coverHas shown signs of decline but still a favourite under Sarri. Starting to show defensive fragility for almost the first time in his Chelsea career and when the side became predictable, his lack of penetration going forward became evidentHas been an option late in games when Chelsea are chasing and can cross well from deep areas, but will surely be moved on this summer with Reece James andor Ola Aina natural squad optionsHas been frustrated at his lack of starts behind Luiz and Rudiger. Has filled in well to an extent when called upon though, but lacked consistencyHas been Sarri\u0027s mind on the pitch and key to the style transition. Very few defenders better with the ball at their feet and for that reason his extension has proven shrewd. Occasional lack of concentration, but that will not change at this stage of his career. One of the few leaders left at Chelsea and was pivotal in stopping this side fully unravel at timesHarshly treated by Sarri, but not a fit for the way he wanted to play, will be fondly remembered after winning everything with the Blues and eventually received the send-off he deservedStarted brilliantly to inspire a new style at the Bridge. But has been treated ridiculously by some Chelsea fans, who have bizarrely booed him at times this season. Responded well in the last few months and appears to have now settled, will play a vital role in the outcome in BakuEmbraced his new, more adventurous role to the right of Jorginho. Added craft to his game and his energy was critical to Sarriball showing promising signs in year one. Injury is a concern ahead of Baku, but he seems set to recover in timeHas not shone much, but always reliable in possession. Just lacks that cutting edge in the final third and has almost no production in terms of goals and assists despite the freedom of his role. Sarri remains a fan and they will try to sign him permanentlyThe Blues youngster was part of the first team squad throughout the season and impressed in the Europa League: brave on the ball and demonstrating excellent positioning - hasn\u0027t played since suffering a back injury in FebruaryFlourished in the second half of the season to show real signs he can blossom into one of the game\u0027s best box-to-box midfielders, scoring 10 goals in the process. Cruelly injured before the Europa League final and will be out for many months with an Achilles injuryScored the late equaliser vs United and won his England place back, but rarely felt like a \u0027starter\u0027, doing little to justify leaving out Loftus-Cheek and Kovacic for long spells. Will need to step it up next season or he will likely be moved onScored 12 goals and made five assists. His strikes against Tottenham and Frankfurt proved especially important and with Gonzalo Higuain and Olivier Giroud blunting the Blues\u0027 attack, he has emerged as probably the best finisher in this squad, supporting the burden on Eden HazardHas not settled at all, looking slow and offering little outside his movement inside the area, he looks set to return to Turin this summer, even if the transfer ban is heldUnable to convince Sarri he was worth a permanent role to spearhead the side\u0027s attack, yet always proving useful when called upon, especially so in the Europa League, where he became the top scorer in the competition with 10 goals alongside Luka Jovic - deserved a longer run in the side in the leagueSuffered a woeful spell of form and loss of confidence and eventually accepted a move to Atletico in January.

I felt there was so much more we could do.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4.

It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.He added that the character’s sillier side was inspired by a comedic turn in Paul Feig’s all-female Ghostbusters reboot.Speaking about the film’s backlash from male fans of the 1984 original, Hemsworth said: “That whole period I was like, ‘What ownership do you guys have over those characters? Oh, you watched the film, therefore you should have a say over where it goes?’ I thought it was very unfortunate and kind of disappointing.”The actor will next be seen in Men In Black International, which he stars in alongside his Avengers co-star Tessa Thompson. it’ll be released in cinemas on 14 June.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Wyler\u0027s romantic musical Funny Girl was banned in Egypt because its male lead Omar Sharif – an Egyptian Muslim – is shown in a romantic storyline with the Jewish Barbra Streisand, who was vocal in her political support for Israel at the height of military tensions with Egypt in 1968.Paul Feig\u0027s all-female reboot of Ghostbusters was denied a release in China due to censorship laws prohibiting the promotion of cults and superstitions.

So disappointing when you pay soo much for a once in a lifetime opportunity.”Another commented: “@spicegirls how disappointing to spend money on a ticket to see you @principalitysta and the support act stole the show!

It could do without Mel B’s rapping, but you can’t have everything.It’s odd that this wasn’t released as a single, because it’s one of the best in the Spice Girls canon: catchy, slickly produced, and with some of the best harmonies the group had to offer. 310 8) \u0027Walk of Life\u0027Did the Spice Girls pull off a reggae track? Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture. Those flamenco guitars and heady summer vibes only add to the sense that, however fleeting that time was, certain memories stay with us forever.This disco-infused number should sound more dated than it actually does. “Who Do You Think You Are” is the Spice Girls at the height of their pop powers a slick, infectious and superbly produced jam with that brass punching through.Mel C gets the spotlight on this funk-influenced number, which was written during the same session as “Love Thing” and features an excellent harmonica solo from Judd Lander. It was their second number one single in the UK – released just as the popularity of “Wannabe” was beginning to wane – and also a top five song in the US.The Spice Girls cribbed a number of musical influences for their catalogue, but Motown is one that really shouldn’t have worked. “Stop”, however, is an uplifting song telling a significant other to slow down and just enjoy the ride, bolstered by a fantastic brass section and a jubilant bass line. A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang.

Cars, on the other hand, run on money and make you fat.But for many of those not already converted to the two-wheels-good, four-wheels-bad brigade, the well-publicised benefits of cycling\u0026nbsp– for your health and your bank balance, as well as the planet – are outweighed by the inherent risks of taking to two wheels in the UK’s traffic-clogged towns and cities.The Dutch learnt how to build proper cycling infrastructure in the 1970s after a spate of road deaths, but the UK is still struggling to prove it takes the issue of safe cycling seriously.Survey after survey shows feeling unsafe on the roads is a major deterrent for new cyclists. One recent poll found almost half of respondents would be encouraged to use their bicycle if they weren’t forced to share the road quite so intimately with cars and lorries.A visit to the continent shows how quickly and easily other countries seem to have found building properly segregated bike lanes – surely screwing rubber “armadillo” humps or plastic bollards into the road is much cheaper and quicker than the full blown road redesigns Transport for London and other local authorities seem to favour.Better transport planning would allow more kids to cycle to schoolNow, a study suggests the benefits of high-quality bike infrastructure actually go far further than just protecting the cyclist.Fatalities among all road users fall dramatically when high quality infrastructure is built, slowing traffic and forcing everyone on the road to take greater care.Even motoring association the AA backs the research and its conclusions that more bike lanes are needed.There is certainly an argument to be made that cyclists must too play a role in ensuring our shared public spaces are both safe and pleasant to use.The high-profile death of a pedestrian hit by a cyclist with no brakes in east London, coupled with anecdotal evidence of red-light runners and pavement cyclists, can contribute to a sense that those on two wheels don’t abide the rules.And while that group are in the minority, their behaviour plays into the hands of those who would sooner see bike lanes returned to their former use then have more genuinely safe infrastructure for everyone to use.But the progress (albeit limited) that has been made – particularly in the capital, but in other large cities such as Manchester, too – is under threat.Powerful lobbyists are putting pressure on decision makers to rip up London’s flagship east-west cycle lane.Opponents of the hugely-popular route, which provides space for a safe commute for thousands each day, have included the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey.Campaigns on social media juxtapose\u0026nbspimages of an empty bike lane hugging the Thames with lines of motor traffic disappearing into the distance as evidence that we need more, not fewer, lanes for cars and vans.So far, thankfully, those in charge of transport planning have not budged.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is understood that there is no plan to replace Ms Weyand, who was deputy chief negotiator and who has an intimate working knowledge of the negotiations.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday evening,\u0026nbspJean-Claude Juncker said he was “crystal clear” that there would be no more renegotiation, reiterating a commission line that he has held since October last year –\u0026nbspbut apparently fallen on deaf ears in Westminster.Tory leadership candidates told there will be no Brexit renegotiationBut despite the unambiguous message emanating from Brussels, most Tory leadership candidates are still standing on platforms of reopening negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, which MPs rejected three times. An attempt by Ms May to bring the deal back for a fourth vote in the House of Commons set in motion a chain of events that resulted in her announcing he resignation – precipitating the current leadership contest.The move of Ms Weyand to be the boss of the Directorate General for Trade\u0026nbspmeans that were the UK to accept the withdrawal agreement, it would also face her in negotiating its future trade deal with the EU – the next phase of talks. She will also oversee the negotiation of trade deals with the rest of the world in the post because it\u0026nbspis not Brexit-specific.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentMr Barnier tweeted: “Congrats to Sabine Weyand on her appointment as new Director-General of Trade!

We now request the EHRC to look at all the evidence and investigate this matter with great urgency.”The complaint includes allegations of Islamophobia among MPs, an “atmosphere of hostility” against Muslim Conservatives, failed complaints processes and an overall denial that Islamophobia is a major issue for the party.Miqdaad Versi, of the MCB,\u0026nbspquestioned whether any of the contenders in the Tory leadership race would “prioritise dealing with the sheer scale of Islamophobia that has consumed the Conservative Party”.Tory Party faces 110 allegations of Islamophobia and racismWatchdog gives Tories one month to respond to Islamophobia complaintsGovernment rejects proposed definition of IslamophobiaMr Johnson was criticised over remarks comparing veiled Muslim women to letter boxes and bank robbers, but he was cleared of breaching the Conservative Party’s code of conduct.An independent panel found that the former foreign secretary was “respectful and tolerant” in his newspaper column.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), requested more information from the Conservatives on Islamophobia\u0026nbspearlier this month.The watchdog, which enforces equality laws, has the power to take action in court.“We have received complaints regarding the Conservative Party and are considering them in line with our usual processes,” an EHRC spokesperson said.“As part of our standard process, we have written to the Conservative Party to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints.”Afzal Khan raises Islamophobia complaints within Tory party and asks when it will adopt the internationally recognised definition of anti-Muslim hateThe call for an Islamophobia probe came as the EHRC announced a formal investigation over antisemitism in Labour on Tuesday.\u0026nbspIt will determine whether the party “has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish”.The MCB said the timing of its complaint was coincidental and pointed out that it alerted media outlets, including\u0026nbspThe Independent, before the EHRC’s announcement on Labour.Conservatives risk repeating Labour’s mistakes on antisemitismThe government was accused of disregarding the “safety and security of British Muslims” after rejecting a definition of Islamophobia put forward following a parliamentary inquiry.\u0026nbspCommunities secretary James Brokenshire pledged to “arrive swiftly at a collective position” earlier this month, after senior police officers raised concern about the potential impact on counterterror powers.Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims, said the government had\u0026nbsp“no more credibility to define Islamophobia than the Labour Party had to redefine antisemitism”.“I have watched, with some amazement and even greater despair, the Conservative Party making exactly the same mistakes over Islamophobia as my party has with antisemitism,” he told the House of Commons.The decision came days before research found that more than 100 people claiming to be Conservative Party members had posted Islamophobic or racist comments online.The MCB has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into prejudice and the handling of complaints within the party.MPs named in the complaint\u0026nbsp(Getty)Dozens of members have been suspended for posting Islamophobic comments on social media, including many directed at leadership contender Sajid Javid.The Conservatives were condemned after reinstating some councillors who had been suspended over racist or prejudiced social media posts.​The government’s commitment to combating anti-Muslim hatred was questioned in the wake of the Christchurch terror attacks, when mosques revealed they had been refused security funding.\u0026nbspWhile the government doubled the pot open for bids from different places of worship, it did not bring the funding up to the £14m awarded specifically to Jewish institutions.Muslim worshippers outside a mosque were targeted in the Finsbury Park terror attack and a man who planned to bomb another mosque in south London was jailed in April.Other incidents have seen women wearing headscarves run over in “revenge” for Islamist atrocities, and a man plough a car into an Indian restaurant because he wanted to “kill a Muslim”.Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, 14 Islamist and five far-right terror plots have been foiled in the UK.\u0026nbspLast week, the Home Affairs Committee was told that more than half of rising hate crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales are committed against Muslims.Muslim Council of Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspEquality and Human Rights Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unemployment is lower and employers in various industries are facing difficulties in finding skilled people to fill their vacancies.“That is why we have recommended expanding the SOL to cover a range of occupations in health, information and engineering fields.”EU immigration to UK falls to lowest level since 2013He noted that the recommendations are only applicable under the current immigration system, while EU free movement remains.“We are recommending a full review of the SOL once there is a clearer picture of what the future immigration system will look like,” Professor Manning said.Under the Tier 2 visa route, UK employers can recruit staff from outside the European Economic Area.Tier 2 applies to two categories of skilled workers – those coming to fill jobs advertised under a resident labour market test and those arriving to take up positions included on the SOL.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve always argued that it’s perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we’re supporting a people’s vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s the democratic thing to do.”Pressure on the Labour leadership ratcheted up several notches after\u0026nbspthe party lost supporters to the Liberal Democrats and Green Party in the EU elections, leaving Labour with just 14 per cent of the vote.Hours after the results were announced, Ms Abbott tweeted: “We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote. But, when we come in third after the Brexit Party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.”Created with Sketch.

She said that\u0026nbspsecuring a general election remained the party’s priority but added: “As the clock\u0026nbsptickets down, if we’re not going to have a general election, we would support a people’s vote.”Jeremy Corbyn has promised a consultation on Labour’s Brexit\u0026nbsppolicy that could end at the party’s annual conference in September, but his close ally Ms Abbott\u0026nbspinsisted he needed to “move quickly”. She said she would personally back Remain in any second referendum.Former prime minister Tony\u0026nbspBlair\u0026nbspsaid he had voted Labour “without great enthusiasm” as he pushed for the party to throw its weight behind a referendum.He said Mr Corbyn “has got to come to a clear position”, telling\u0026nbspSky News: “The one that is very obvious is that both party leaderships have made the same mistake, which is to think that it’s possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides.“What the European elections show you is that isn’t possible.”As Labour isions on Brexit resurfaced in the aftermath of the elections, MPs\u0026nbspin Leave-supporting areas warned against another referendum.Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said it would most likely result in a no-deal outcome.Labour leadership backs ‘public vote’ on BrexitConservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routLabour should promise referendum after ‘kicking’ say Corbyn alliesLabour must back second referendum or face election loss, Watson warnsShe said: “Obviously in constituencies like Wigan you get very mixed views, you get different views like everywhere in the country, but to most people the idea of a second referendum just seems quite absurd.“People were asked what they think, you can see from the results that we had here, that very few people have changed their minds and if there is a shift in this area of the country I think it’s towards no-deal Brexit.”Ms Nandy added: “I think we’ve got to wake up to the seriousness, not just of what we’re about to do to the Labour Party, but what we’re about to do the country because I strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.”She went on: “There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave, in towns like mine, to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there’s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Utilities are expecting restoration to take several days.National Weather Service issues highest tornado warnings in two yearsFor now, Dayton city officials have asked residents to conserve water, as power was lost in the city’s water plants and pump stations.Montgomery County, where Dayton is\u0026nbsplocated, Miami County, and Greene County were the most affected by the tornadoes, which authorities described as large and dangerous.\u0026nbspThe National Guard has been deployed in the aftermath.Tornadoes also touched down in nearby Trotwood, where the mayor told residents that power lines and trees were down. Ohio’s tornado spree marks the latest in a particularly harsh year for tornadoes in the US, which have caused major damage and several deaths in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, and several other states.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is just the beginning.In a warning to the Westminster parties, he said: If we dont leave on October  then the scores you have seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, and we are getting ready for it.Mr Farage repeated his demand for the Brexit Party to be involved in the negotiations ahead of the Halloween deadline.All EU citizens, as long as they are registered to vote, have the right to vote in the European elections.The UK uses the D’Hondt system of proportional representation which means the number of MEPs a party wins is directly related to the percentage of votes it receives.Voters choose a single party instead of an inidual candidate.This means all political parties have the chance to send representatives to the European Parliament.The proportion of seats given by a party directly reflects the proportion of votes won.In the first round of counting, the party with the most votes is allocated a seat for the candidate at the top of its list.Under the D’Hondt method, each party’s total number of votes is repeatedly ided – until all seats are filled – by isor  + the number of seats already allocated.If it is still top it gains another seat. If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta, who have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after Mrs Mays administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Labour didn’t administer that kicking — instead they lost votes everywhere from Britain’s industrial heartlands to North London’s organic groceries.The message is clear: A plague on all your houses. And the lessons the parties should learn are equally obvious.For the Tories, it is that they have no God-given right to power. And their failure to deliver Brexit could be their death knell unless they get on the right track, sharpish.The leadership battle is already doing them serious damage as it turns all too quickly into a circular firing squad.We’ve got nothing against bright youngsters like Rory Stewart taking a punt at the premiership, but having a pop at colleagues on day one won’t help rebuild the party’s battered reputation.But that’s nothing compared to the current Chancellor threatening to bring down the Governmenta new leader pushes for a clean-break Brexit, evenhis party’s MPs and members vote for exactly that.If Hammond hasn’t clocked that failing to deliver the referendum result isn’t endearing the party to voters, these European results are a blunt reminder.Everybody who fancies the top job needs to explain, in detail, their Brexit plan. Andthey win, the party MUST deliver it. No s, no buts.Winning back Brexit Party voters is vital, but so is moving on from the referendum and pushing forward with a revitalised domestic programme.As for Labour  All that game-playing in Westminster hasn’t done them much good.But they still haven’t learnt.Emily Thornberry’s reaction to the Brexit Party’s streaking triumph around the country was to come out in favour of a second referendum.Working people have abandoned this prehistoric party and their dinosaur leader in droves.The European elections should never have happened. We should be out of the EU by now.For the Government, time could not be more pressing. A new leader can restore some faith in our politics, and take on Corbyn’s Marxists.The Tories need a quick contest, and a leader with a proper mandate. Anything  risks annihilation. But that doesn’t mean you can just abandon personal responsibility and demand taxpayers will bail you out.On that point, Paul Mason has pushed our sympathy to breaking point.And we worry the sense of entitlement that he displays when he opens his mouth is becoming st century Britain’s disease. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s time for a new generation to lead the charge into our future with boldness and vision.We must strengthen our Union, and the people we serve need a new social contract. A good job, a secure home and a brilliant school are the nuts and bolts of a happy le.As Housing Minister, it’s been my mission to build more high-quality homes as fast as we can, and numbers are looking good but there is much more work to do. We must pledge to offer these essentials to everyone: Job, House, School.I’ve run my own company for more than two decades, and weathered some really tough times, so I understand the opportunities and challenges small businesses face.We must revolutionise our economy, freeing a new generation of entrepreneurs to take risks and build businesses, creating jobs and wealth.And crucially we must spread that wealth with radical policies that make it easier for employees to own a stake in the business they work for, and to own shares generally. Everyone should have a piece of the national balance sheet.The Conservative Party must become the party of children, with their welfare, protection and future at the heart of everything we do.All of us have only one chance at childhood. It’s the foundation of our hopes, aspirations and character. There must be an all-out assault on child poverty, and we need to make the lives of parents easier.I’ve had political responsibility for a challenging social services department and London’s police force.Four years focused on a terrying surge in youth violence – and getting it under control – confirmed my view that education is the only social policy that consistently works.It is an escape route from a dead end, and the bedrock of social mobility. It’s also the reason I, and millions like me, got where we are.As Prime Minister I would make ours the party of well-funded schools, investing in the future of each and every child.That means investing heavily in science to tackle climate change and disease.As the chair of London Hydrogen, I promoted the green, British hydrogen fuel cell, and I founded the le sciences hub MedCity. I’ve led the debate on science in Parliament, and green tech would be central to my mission.We won’t get the chance to take on these and other pressing challenges unless we first work together to get Brexit completed.These steps - unity, a viable Brexit plan and a compelling domestic agenda - will secure a bright future for our remarkable country.I got into politics to get things done. As Deputy Mayor for Policing in the capital I drove action to cut teen killings by % and devised our first ever violence against women and girls strategy.I would bring this experience of fighting crime to being Prime Minister.

On Sunday it took several minutes to establish whether or not one of them, Wheeler Dealer, could impersonate an animal.When it does get going the show can very occasionally feel like arriving two hours late at the pub. Everyone’s laughing but you’ve no idea why.For the most part, though, The Ranganation belongs to the same comedy applause school as The Last Leg, Mash Report and New World Order.They’ll clap anything here, in fact. Romesh’s mum admits taking a curry to the cinema . Nigel Farage gets covered in milkshake . The Dogfather telling us to: “Stop raping the planet,” .Although, I say anything, the moment it broke down was when half a dozen people applauded the idea of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and, woah!, Romesh had to threaten them, jokingly, with ejection.They’d broken the rules, you see. Shows like The Ranganation like to think of themselves as edgy, but they’re very tightly governed by the laws of political correctness.This means you no longer have to be funny to be a stand-up or comedy host, but you must be on-message, which is why, paradoxically, we’ve never had more comedians on telly but so few actual laughs.Flogging them to death doesn’t work either. You may have found Katherine Ryan and Romesh funny the first time you saw them, but you’re probably fed up with the sight of them by their thousandth appearance.As for the actual process of this show The Ranganation wasn’t sure dating apps worked and milkshake throwing was also a grey area, but the host definitely thought we could save the planet by not flushing our toilets.“So do you mindI come round your house and p*** like a horse ”It’d be appreciated, ta.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I am not morbidly obese.”Good Morning Britain, Kevin Maguire: “There are quite a few Leave voters at the BBC.”And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “Honestly,Andi Peters was in  Hunks, which he should be, he’d be scoring .” Out of what, Susanna OVER on BBC’s look-into-the-future drama Years And Years, all-out nuclear war between China and America seems to have fizzled out after one episode.The good news, though, is it seems to have released enough radiation poisoning to kill off Jessica Hynes’s character, Edith, the campaigner, activist and all-round pain-in-the-ar*e, within the next couple of episodes.If you think that’ll be the end of the political lecture, however, you couldn’t be more wrong.Writer Russell T Davies is far too hot under the collar about America, Israel, “the West”, bankers, privatisation and “NHS cuts” to get off his high horse any time soon.Weirdly, he also wants Years And Years viewers to try and believe that, in the not-too-distant future, a Christian regime, in the Ukraine, will be torturing gay people.Which, given that homosexuality is currently and exclusively a death penalty offence in ten Islamic states, has to be one of the most cowardly distortions of reality I’ve ever seen on a television drama.Far less sinister, but almost as tiresome, is the continued presence of Alexander Armstrong on Years And Years.He turned up hosting a  edition of Have I Got News For You in the first episode, and then reappeared fronting Pointless Celebrities, in the year , last week.So don’t expect any sympathyhe reappears tonight on Best Ever Christmas , still murdering Fields Of bloody Gold.You’ve been given your four-minute warning.Michael Owen: “It was great opportunityism from the striker.”And Neil Lennon: “It’s a once-in-a-letime opportunity that’s come round again.”Victoria Coren Mitchell’s nauseating love-in with MP Jess Phillips on Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan telling Le Stories guest Mel B The Spice Girls were “the female Beatles”, when they weren’t even the female Tremeloes.Hollyoaks actor Maxim Baldry attempting a Ukrainian accent in Years And Years.Every bone-idle chancer in Britain interpreting “Bank Holiday Monday” as “Take Friday off as well”.And Britain’s Got Talent auditions getting lost in sob stories, sentimentality and all those magical charisma voids who begin by announcing: “I need someone to come up and help me.” BZZZZZ, “Next ”B “Form a conga with Seumas Milne and start celebrating.”C “We don’t know.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  Serbian Branislav Ivanovic joined which London-based football team ”I’d have had these people housed in the sort of lodges we give away on this programme.”But you weren’t, so stop playing the hero and just link to your rip-off phone-line competition. Picture research by Alfie Snelling.NEVER a good sign, is it, when you vomit up your own decomposed internal organs, have to be buried in a zinc coffin and a cement mixer turns up to your funeral That’s the thing about Sky Atlantic’s Chernobyl, though, it spares you no details about the greatest technological catastrophe of the th century. Nor should it.Because, shamefully, I hadn’t realised just how close the  disaster came to destroying the entire planet.As well as flagging up my own appalling ignorance, this must also be some sort of tribute to the power of a production where they’ve got everything right, from the Soviet-era clothingto the script and performances of all the main leads, Jared Harris, Jessie Buckley, Emily Watson and even the bloke in the Mikhail Gorbachev skull cap.It loses absolutely nothing, either, from the fact that Finchy from The Office appears to have been in the Politburo, and that the heroic leader of the Russian miners, who tunnelled underneath the damaged reactor, was Trevor off EastEnders.Well, OK, maybe it takes a bit of the edge off, but still, Chernobyl is not just the best thing on TV, it’s the only thing right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tory MEPs were almost wiped out.It was expected, but that cannot hide the seriousness of the Conservatives’ crisis. Not only did most voters abandon them — even the majority of their own members voted for the Brexit Party.Many others, including me, refused to take part in a ballot that should never have taken place, for an organisation that we should not be part of.No party can last for long with its vote in freefall and its activists staying home or supporting a rival.The Tories must find a way to regain trust, inspire their troops and win back millions of lost voters.That means being completely honest and clear about why this happened. It is human nature to look for comforting excuses to explain away shocking news. But that would be no use.This crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Conservatives gave the people a referendum and promised, before, during and after, to do as voters decided.Theresa May pledged scores of times that we would leave the EU, deal or no deal, in March.She broke that promise and her Cabinet colleagues let her do it. As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise.

The same pattern was repeated where.In Germany, a surge for the Greens brought the long dominant Christian Democrats their worst result in decades.In France, Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally topped the poll, and the two traditional centrist parties – the Republicans and the Socialists – almost disappeared.Even more dramatic gains for the Eurosceptics could be found in Italy. The nationalist League was far in front, with  per cent of the vote, while the maverick, rebellious Five Star movement won  per cent, putting the Italian anti-EU forces in an absolute majority.Populists also triumphed in Hungary, where Viktor Orban Civic Alliance gained no less than  per cent of the vote, and in Poland, where the right-wing Law and Justice party was victorious with  per cent.Indeed, throughout Europe there were advances for anti-establishment politicians - whether it be the Greens in Ireland or the nationalists in Sweden.As triumphant Greens edge out centre-left and centre-right parties, the EU will become even more polarised and ided, which will make it harder for parliament to .All this change is driven by widespread outrage at the disaster that the EU has inflicted on the countries of Europe.Without any mandate, the unaccountable, power-mad cabal in Brussels has weakened the fabric of the continent.National democracy has been pulverised by the quest for EU unication.National identities have been undermined by mass immigration on an unprecedented scale, particularly after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the floodgates in .National economic interests have been sacriced on the altar of the European single currency.The EU fanatics like to paint populism as a form of extremism but, on the contrary, it is the natural response to the removal of democratic rights and freedoms.Across Europe, people want their countries back. They have had enough of betrayal.They prefer to govern themselves rather than be ruled by unelected officials.They are tired of being labelled bigots simply for feeling a sense of patriotism, that noble ideal which is really an extension of love of family.The real extremists are those EU zealots who show contempt for the ideas of national pride and sovereignty.Yet, there is no sign that the Brussels regime, cocooned by its ideology, has woken up to the scale of the upheaval.Just the opposite is true.Since yesterday, the EU ruling elite and its cheerleaders have indulged in a gigantic propaganda exercise, pretending that the results are not that signicant, that the populist insurgency has been exaggerated, that the barbarians have been held at the gates.In this climate of delusion, it is asnothing has happened.An attitude of business as usual prevails, as shown by today’s Brussels summit, where European leaders discussed the preparations for choosing a new EU President and Commission, given that the term of Jean Claude Juncker will soon end.In the time-honoured fashion of the EU’s institutions, another establishment stitch-up is probably on the way.Beyond mouthing a few empty words about reform, Brussels bosses seem to have learned no lesson from the anti-establishment fury.That is because they are so obsessed with the grand European project of political unity.Since its foundation in the s, the entire purpose of European Community has been the creation of a federal superstate.Every policy, every treaty is focused on the mission of ever closer union towards the ultimate goal of a United States of Europe.Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of this crusade. Even democracy and nationhood must be sacriced for the sake of the integrationist dogma.At the entrance to the Visitors Centre in the European Parliament, there is a plaque with the words, “National sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time”, for which the “final remedy is the federal union of the people.”That was written by the British diplomat Lord Lothian, a committed appeaser right up to . His spirit still permeates the corridors of power in Brussels.Federalism explains why the EU is so addicted to the abolition of borders through free movement, because the obliteration of national identities will promote the new concept of European citizenship.Similarly, the creation of the single currency in  was not primarily an economic initiative but a political vehicle to enforce integration by undermining national independence.Through its arrogance, the EU is sowing the seeds for its own destruction.Without change, Brussels will become ever more crisis-ridden, ever more in-debted, ever more unpopular.The betrayal of the public is unsustainable in the long-term. In fact, collapse could arrive swtly in the coming decade, either through another financial crisis or through another major country, like Italy or France, deciding to leave.If the Brussels bosses had any sense, they would abandon their ideological project and instead make the union just a trading bloc of free, independent nations.That is what Britain was meant to have joined in  when we signed up for the Common Market, only to find we were sucked into the federalist quagmire.The British people eventually woke up to this reality.We had the courage to vote for independence - and Brexit is the spark that has helped to fuel the flames of rebellion across the continent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the potential ­leadership contenders privately understand it, as do growing numbers of MPs.The question is whether they are brave enough to place such an unpopular truth before party members.When I predicted six weeks ago that the Conservative Party was headed for a single-figures vote in the European election unless it ditched Theresa May, there was much scoffing.Yes, I was told, things would be bad, but not that bad. Well, on Thursday, we secured . per cent.If we break that vote down by constituency, every single Tory MP loses.The first-past-the-post system is capricious. It protects you until, all of a sudden, it eliminates you.Just ask Scottish Labour.As long as our political debate revolves around Brexit, people are likely to vote for the most hardline pro and anti-Brexit parties.Indeed, the longer this wretched argument goes on, the more radicalised both sides become. Voters identy as Remain or Leave rather than according to their old party alignments.Three years ago, at the time of the referendum campaign, it was still a civil conversation rather than a civil war.The polarisation has come since the result, and it has become worse with every passing week.Most Leavers now want No Deal. Most Remainers want another referendum.The moment when both sides might have accepted a compromise — ideally a Swiss-type solution that would have taken us out of the EU’s political structures while retaining close economic links — has probably passed.So whose fault is it that we are in this situation  Hardliners on both sides must take their share of the blame.Those Remainers who promised to respect the result but then worked to frustrate it have done terrible damage to our politics.Those Leavers who, forgetting everything they said during the campaign, now insist that anything short of No Deal is a betrayal, have likewise destroyed trust in the system.But the chief responsibility lies with Theresa May.It was she who dug in on the wrong issues while conceding on the wrong issues, who mulishly insisted that it was all about immigration, who managed to convince both sides that she was secretly working for the other, who so aggravated EU leaders that, by the end, they were predisposed to reject anything she asked for because it was she who was doing the asking.Worst of all, she called and then lost the  election. From that moment, it was clear that our Parliament was prepared to frustrate Brexit.The EU got the message and started making deliberately absurd and vindictive demands, culminating in the Irish backstop which, incredibly, Theresa May accepted.We now face withdrawal terms so disadvantageous that they are worse than either staying or quitting — exactly as Michel Barnier intended.Which brings us back to the Catch-.Parliament does not intend to allow any government to leave the EU with No Deal, and the Commons Speaker has made clear that he is prepared to bend the rules in any way necessary to secure that end.In normal times, a Conservative leader would go to the country saying: “Give me the mandate I need. If Brussels knows we are ready for No Deal, we will get a good deal. We just need the numbers in Parliament.“Do you want me in charge, or a Marxist nostalgic who refuses to have a position on Brexit ”In normal times, such a leader would win comfortably. But these are not normal times.A large chunk of the electorate is now disposed to blame the Conservatives for the impasse rather than the parties that have actually been voting against Brexit.Nigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to contest every seat at the next election. The idea that he might stand aside in certain constituencies in order to stop Corbyn is based on a misunderstanding of how he operates.He is back at the head of a populist insurgent party.The last thing he wants is to have that party’s grievance addressed and so put himself out of business.Is there any solution  Possibly.It may be that Parliament cannot in fact block a No Deal Brexit. It may be that,forced to choose, MPs will baulk at voting to revoke Article .It may be that France, or another EU state, vetoes any extension beyond October  — though that is unlikely.Or it may be that the Tories could, in fact, win a general election.Perhaps I am wrong about Farage’s motivations, and he will agree to an electoral pact, fighting Labour in the North while standing aside in the South.Or maybe there’s another way out of the jam, one I can’t think of.But what cannot be denied is that the dilemma exists.There is no point in saying, “Just leave!” or “I’ll get us a better deal!” unless you are clear about how you intend to do it.The trouble is that, in the current mood, those are precisely the slogans that many Tory activists want to hear.The candidate who levels with them, who sets out the dilemma honestly and outlines a proposed route out of it, may become unelectable.

Secondly, I do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn’t seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.”Bercow yesterday told a US audience it was “unimaginable” MPs won’t be able to act despite a No Deal exit being the legal default and warned there are years of debate ahead” on Brexit.The arch-Remainers words fly in the face of Tory leadership front runners Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, who have both guaranteed the UK will leave the EU by Halloween - with or without a deal.Mr Bercow also fuelled the peoples vote campaign by suggesting MPs had the right to force a second referendum or even revoke Article .He said: They can’t be wished away or snfed at, but these matters were matters decided by the last Parliament. No Parliament can bind the hands of its successor. This Parliament can do as this Parliament thinks fit.Bercow broke his pledge to stand down by June last year.When he stood to be Speaker in  he promised only to serve for nine years but he has justied staying on longer because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit.But European Commission President Jean Claude Junker delivered a stark message to candidates in the race to replace Theresa May.Speaking to television cameras outside a summit in Brussels he said: There will be no renegotiation.The Eurocrats stubborn stance is bad news for Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunts Tory leadership bid. Yesterday, he said his Brexit policy was to try for renegotiation.Britain is on course to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal - unless the law is changed to extend further.There is currently no provision for MPs to amend the law to stop Britain leaving without a deal and leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab have warned they may end up going for it.But Mr Bercow’s comments yesterday signal he is willing to help create a way for MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.He said there was “no inevitability” about a No Deal Brexit and dismissed the suggestion that MPs had lost their chance to block No Deal once and for all.The only way to completely rule out a No Deal Brexit is for Britain to revoke Article .A request for a further extension could be blocked by just one EU member state - meaning Britain would leave without a deal on October .Speaking at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC, the Speaker said: “There is a dference between a legal default position and what the interplay of dferent political forces in parliament will facilitate.”He added: “The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable.”“The appetite for the house to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted. Indeed some would say it’s voracious.“The house will want to have its say. The idea that the house will not have it say is for the birds. Parliament is a big player in this.“The idea that Parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable.

He wants to block it. He wants to veto the referendum result and will abuse the role of Speaker to advance his cause. He is even trying to comment on the leadership campaign.”Fellow Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told The Sun: “At a time when confidence in politicians’ promises is at an all-time low, the Speaker doubles down and breaks another promise.It’s clear that he has his own agenda to overturn the result of the referendum and keep us in the European Union. He’s a Speaker who’s ripped every page of impartiality from the Speaker’s rulebook.“And he has tried to fill the power vacuum of a weak Prime Minister and a weak Leader of the Opposition.”But Remainers rejoiced at Mr Bercow’s decision to stay. Labour peer Lord Adonis tweeted: “John Bercow absolutely right to stay in post until Brexit is resolved. He has enabled parliament  the people to take back control from a dictatorial  dangerous government. His duty is to remain.”Mrs Miller has led calls for Mr Bercow to stand aside since the independent Cox Report called on the Speaker to consider standing down after finding the Parliament’s current leadership incapable of changing a widespread culture of bullying and harassment.Stepping up her demands for him to go today, Mrs Miller said: The Cox Report was clear that the House of Commons needs a wholesale change in leadership to address an unacceptable culture of bullying and harassment.The Cox report specically includes the Speaker in that recommendation, the most senior person in the House of Commons.

At least  MPs have already chucked their hats in the ring to replace her in a contest dominated by Brexit. By the end of July we could have a hard Brexiteer Prime Minister who wants to crash the UK out with no deal. Or it could be a more moderate candidate, a continuity May option of entering yet more negotiations with the EU. So who is bidding to replace Theresa May  Hereaposs a full rundown of the candidates with profiles, odds and how much of a True Blue Tory Warrior™ they are. Or click here to see where they all stand on Brexit.  Unlike Mrs Mayaposs election in , where Tory members never voted, this race promises to be the most bruising in years. And just like her election, it will have profound consequences for Brexit - with a hard-right, Hard Leaver likely to take the reins. Under the rules of a Tory leadership race, candidates bidding for the crown must be nominated by two or more fellow Tory MPs. A series of knockout ballots is then held among MPs to whittle down the wide field of candidates to just two.  Those two preferred candidates go to a run-off of the wider Conservative Party, with its , members eligible to vote. The candidate who wins the most votes becomes the leader.  All the Tory leadership contenders Declared openly that they will run Odds retrieved from Paddy Power, May Boris Johnson -   Dominic Raab -   Michael Gove -   Andrea Leadsom -   Jeremy Hunt -   Rory Stewart -   Sajid Javid -   Matt Hancock -   James Cleverly -   Esther McVey -   Kit Malthouse - not listed on Paddy PowerReported, hinted - or refused to rule outSteve Baker Graham Brady   James Cleverly Penny Mordaunt  Mark Harper David Gauke James BrokenshireLeading Tories who WONaposT be runningAmber Rudd Liz Truss Justine Greening David Lidington Jacob Rees-Mogg Johnny Mercer Tobias Ellwood David Davis Victoria Atkins Ken Clarke Dominic Grieve Tom Tugendhat    Profiles of the candidates Boris Johnson  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Brexiteer and former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, , has been a leading voice against Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plan - and heaposs been preparing for this for years. The Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign after a last-minute decision to back Brexit. He resigned from the Cabinet in  in protest at Mayaposs plan. He was tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out after Michael Gove stabbed him in the back with a last-minute bid for the top job. Since then heaposs lost weight and had a haircut in what many argued was a pre-leadership bid upgrade. Sure enough he confirmed by telling a business conference: Iaposm going to go for it! Selecting the former mayor of London for eight years would enrage Tory Remainers, who believe he is in this game only for himself and his ego. He became notorious for his attention-grabbing offensive comments, when he called black people piccaninnies, said Barack Obama was part-Kenyan and compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. Heaposs also criticised for vast sums of money he rakes in alongside being an MP for speeches and a £,-a-yearcolumn - which was rapped for inaccuracy by the press regulator. Meanwhile, heaposs been rapped for showing a lack of respect to Parliament by repeatedly breaking Commons rules. Supporters say that since splitting with his long-suffering we Marina Wheeler and shacking up with ex-Tory head of press Carrie Symonds, heaposs mended his ways and become more serious. But scores of Tory MPs would vote for Anyone But Boris and a Scottish operation to stop him was nicknamed Operation Arse. Dominic Raab  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING: .   During his four-month stint as Brexit Secretary, ultra-hard Leaver Dominic Raab suggested he would use leaving the EU to slash business taxes. Now heaposs running for leader heaposs hinted p could be slashed off income tax - cutting billions from the public purse. And that wasnapost all that would anger left-wingers. The -year-old sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. He claimed: The typical user... is someone who has a cash flow problem. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Mr Raab positioned himself early on for the leadership, setting out his plans to tackle kne crime with “robust policing” and community work. He also paraded in his home in a cringeworthy interview with his we. And he attempted to outflank hostile competition by addressing claims he used a gagging order, to silence a former colleague who accused him of bullying. Mr Raab told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to  before he was an MP, were completely ”. Michael Gove  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race stabbing Boris in the back before finishing third. And he kept his powder dry in the days immediately following Theresa Mayaposs announcement she would quit. But behind the scenes his allies, including Treasury minister Mel Stride, have been approaching MPs in the most unlikely positions to seethey will join his slate. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror Mr Gove was one of the most likely to be elected. Despite infuriating teachers when he was Education Secretary, and stabbing Boris Johnson in the back for leadership in , the -year-old is seen as a competent media performer and has won plaudits as a campaigner for environmental issues. He has already paraded with his Scottish parents as part of the proxy leadership contest in the party. He was a prominent face in the Brexit campaign, but he isnapost wildly trusted by other figures on the Conservativesapos eurosceptic wing.    Jeremy Hunt  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. And despite a sht towards Eurosceptic views heaposs now even more prominent - warning deliberately causing No Deal would be political suicide and put Corbyn in No. Mr Hunt has marked himself out as the more moderate candidate against hard Brexiteers but could risk being seen as the continuity candidate for Theresa May. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt, , fought a long battle with the medical profession over a new contract for doctorsapos working conditions. The -year-old became Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring.    Andrea Leadsom  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, grammar-school educated former bank executive is about as true blue Tory as you can get. She survived to the final two of the  Tory leadership race, pitching herself as the Hard Brexit, blue alternative to Theresa May with a cringeworthy march in Westminster. But she infamously pulled out after making controversial remarks about motherhood and trying to deny them. She was loyal in public for two years of Cabinet office while furiously working to push towards a harder Brexit in private, through the pizza club of Tory ministers. She played a crucial part in forcing Theresa Mayaposs resignation announcement, resigning from the PMaposs cabinet and blasting her plan hours before the EU elections.    Rory Stewart  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Hong Kong-born son of a diplomat, an Old Etonian, once admitted his career gives the appearance he was a spy. The -year-old delivered his own child after a career as a diplomat in the Foreign Office. He was elected MP for Penrith and the Border in  and joined the government in . The International Development Secretary wasted no time after being promoted to the Cabinet in May . He announced his pitch to be PM within hours. He has since travelled to Leave-voting areas such as Barking to put himself out in the faces of the public. Yet his approach - blindly following the PMaposs Brexit deal and saying it might even be worth splitting the party for - has made him wildly unpopular among Tory Brexiteers.    Sajid Javid   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:       It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer. That means Mr Javid, , who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal - and has picked public fights with Mrs May on key issues like immigration and police funding. But his star has fallen over chaotic handling of migrants crossing the Channel. He was accused of stoking tensions by declaring a national emergency to deal with a few hundred migrant crossings over a period of months. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Matt Hancock  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING: .     The ambitious -year-old entered politics as George Osborneaposs adviser and was in the inner circle of the famously cliquey ex-Chancellor. The parkour- and karaoke-loving Conservative entered Parliament in , Government in  and joined the DCMS in July  after Mrs May took over as Prime Minister. He was swtly promoted to Culture Secretary and then Health Secretary. But he came under fire for accepting thousands from the boss of a think tank which wants to scrap the NHS. Within days of the PMaposs announcement, he somehow found his way onto the Good Morning Britain sofa, where he said of leadership: I think you don’t rule out these things.” Laying out his policy stall beyond Brexit he said he wants to make Britain a high-tech economy exporting to the global middle class. And he said the UK needs to drive up the minimum wage at the same time as slashing tax. Esther McVey    VOTED: Leave  TRUE BLUE RATING:   The hardline Brexiteer confirmed she will be running for the Tory leadership with a pledge to slash £billion from foreign aid, and spend it on schools and the police. The former welfare-slasher and rank outsider said: Iaposve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. But former GMTV presenter Ms McVey became notorious among benefit claimants after working as a Minister and later Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions. Her blunt style drew floods of criticism even when she managed to secure limited extra money for cash-starved Universal Credit, and U-turned on a benefit cut for the disabled.  Over the years, she made a number of controversial comments which turned her into a lightning rod for anger about benefits. She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . She made clear that under her leadership Britain would leave the EU on October  - deal or no deal. Kit Malthouse    VOTED: Leave    TRUE BLUE RATING:   The former Deputy Mayor of London under Boris Johnson threw his hat in the ring, clearly deciding he could do a better job. The -year-old was an accountant before joining Tory politics and winning the safe seat of North West Hampshire in . He quickly rose through the ranks, joining the DWP as a junior minister before being made Housing Minister where he had the tough task of dealing with fallout from the Grenfell Tower disaster. He ingratiated himself with Brexit-backing MPs by devising the aposMalthouse compromiseapos - a plan for high-tech border checks and other features to solve the Irish border issue. Critics say the plan is unworkable. He openly admitted making le uncomfortable for the homeless as part of a zero-tolerance crackdown when he was on Westminster City Council. Under his watch, the council was accused by one London Assembly member of adopting a ruthless policy towards homeless people that included hosing them out of doorways. Asked in he was behind such a hosing policy, Mr Malthouse replied: We certainly instituted a policy of making le - it sounds counterintuitive and cruel - more uncomfortable that is absolutely right. James Cleverly  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    James Cleverly only won his seat in  but claimed he could deliver the change the country needs after the failed reign of Theresa May . Despite being a fierce defender of the PM until she resigned, the -year-old Brexit Minister admitted: She didnapost fit well with the role of Prime Minister. The Braintree MP and former Territorial Army Major would become the first PM from an ethnic minority backgroundhe was elected. He served on the London Assembly from  before joining Parliament and rising to a Tory Vice Chairman and Brexit Minister. He sparked fury in  by calling for the minimum wage to be scrapped. According to the Evening Standard, he made the call during a Tory conference event hosted by the right-wing, anti-state pressure group Taxpayersapos Alliance. The famously plain-speaking MP also admitted smoking cannabis and watching online porn in a radio interview shortly after becoming an MP. Today Mr Cleverly said he would absolutely lead the UK out of the EU in a No Deal Brexitneeded. But he said it is not my preferred destination and appeared not to rule out a possible delay beyond October . Still uncleartheyaposll run Penny Mordaunt  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Recently promoted to Defence Secretary, Penny Mordaunt is a -year-old Royal Navy reservist whoaposs only been an MP since  - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name. From bellyflopping on TV ing show Splash! to slashing billions off benefits and lying about Brexit, sheaposs often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons. The daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive. She worked in a factory and as a magicianaposs assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to. The PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s  and  election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.    Graham Brady VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, made a Sir in , holds Theresa Mayaposs fate in his hands as chairman of the  Committee. The august body runs leadership challenges in the Conservative Party and could change the rules to force Mrs May out. Heaposs currently its premier diplomat in the Tory war, but could reportedly sacrice his immunity to run for the top job himself. The grammar-school-educated MP for Altrincham and Sale West is a former PR man who turned MP in  and was the chief aide to former Tory leader Michael Howard. David Gauke  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The pro-Remain Justice Secretary is highly unlikely to be putting his hat in the ring. But there is some suggested he could team up with fellow Remainer Amber Rudd to run on a joint ticket. He also gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday  May straying beyond the confines of his brief. Mr Gauke took a swipe at populists like Boris Johnson saying: Populism would undermine the United Kingdom.  In the context of the United Kingdom, right-wing populism means English nationalism. The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they’re just plain wrong. Big hitters who ruled themselves out Amber Rudd VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Amber Rudd was previously seen as a favourite to replace Mrs May. But as the party has drted to the right the moderate Remainer Ms Rudd had fallen out of favour. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd, , ed to government as Work and Pensions Secretary. She has a tiny majority in her seat of Hastings and Rye, which would make her vulnerable to any co-ordinated insurgency from local Labour backers. The Work and Pensions Secretary gave a wide-ranging speech on  May that called for a st Century approach to work in what many will see as a pitch for the Tory leadership. She said I hope a softening of benefit sanctions show her credentials as a so-called aposOne Nationapos Tory. And she admitted sanctions may have damaged the Tory brand, saying: If there has been damage I hope we can reverse that.  She dodged questions on whether she would throw her hat in the ring for the Tory leadership, saying: “I’m committed to the DWP”. But she later pulled out accepting the Tory party would want someone fully behind Brexit. Liz Truss  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Chief Secretary of the Treasury is about as right wing as they come when it comes to economics. The -year-old also loves to tell a joke and hasnapost really hidden her ambition to one day hold the top job. She even posed in Westminster for a photo shoot and an interview with the Sunday Times, calling for £bn to be spent on tax cuts. And she appeared in a series of hair-raising photos with wide-bottomed trousers before giving a speech that ranged far beyond her brief. But disappointing performances in high profile jobs like her time a Justice Secretary left some MPs questioningshe has what it takes for the top job. She voted to Remain in the referendum - and since said she would change her mind and became a born-again Brexiteer. But she dropped out saying the leader had to be someone who voted Leave in .

Others pointed out his comments were published just moments after he signed a clean campaign pledge, vowing not to speak ill of fellow Conservatives. Mr Hancock later insisted: I mean that we need to back business and not bash business.    This is incredibly important for the future of the country, for the future of the Conservative Party, that in this leadership debate we understand that we need to be a pro-business party. We need to support businesses because theyaposre the ones who create the jobs.    The eyebrow-raising remark is one of many ways in which Tories are attempting to hog the limelight in a crowded field of  candidates. Remainer Rory Stewart has travelled across the country, from Barking and Kew Gardens to Wigan, posting videos on social media urging people to talk to him. But the International Development Secretary was mocked for pretending to hold his phone in the selfie position - and holding a meet-and-greet in an £ attraction. Meanwhile the clean campaign pledge itself descended into infighting amid claims not all candidates were invited to sign up.

Kemi was arrested in May last year on suspicion of trying to kill Meghan after the younger woman started dating her ex Andrew Coaker, , from Reading. The incident occurred outside flats in Federico Garcia Lorca Street near Magaluf’s brash Punta Ballena area. She was arrested half an hour after the May   incident in the nearby resort of Cala Vinyes.    The victim’s injuries were initially described as serious and she took three weeks to recover from leg wounds which required surgery. The judge handed her a two-year suspended jail sentence for a crime of wounding with a dangerous weapon as well as a three-year restraining order which prevents her from going within  metres of her victim A second woman - who was in the hire car with Kemi and is believed to be a relative of Kemi’s although it was not confirmed at the time by officials - was told she will not face any court action. Civil Guard officers confirmed at the time they had arrested a British woman then aged , although they did not name her.  A spokesman for the Civil Guard said in a statement at the time: “Officers assisted a a group of people in Magaluf who were around a woman they spotted lying on the ground. “That woman was an injured British national. They added: “Witnesses said a car had run her over before speeding away from the scene. One of the witnesses said the car had mounted the pavement intent on running over the woman. “Officers were told the vehicle was a small, white car and police patrols were alerted. “Thirty minutes later a Civil Guard patrol searching for the vehicle in Cala Vinyes spotted a suspect car with two young women inside whose descriptions matched those of the people they were looking for. Coaker claimed after her arrest that her victim would taunt her whenever they crossed paths in Magaluf and insisted she only wanted to scare her when she drove at her. She learnt her fate at a criminal court in the Majorcan capital Palma. Kemi was thought to have been using her married name rather than her maiden name Pereira at the time of the incident. It later emerged she was the sister of a jailed drugs dealer. John Pereira, , was jailed in  for five years and six months after cocaine worth £ was found at his home in Majorca. Reports at the time said he had violence and drugs convictions in the UK and would be sent back to Britain after serving his time in Majorca because he was wanted for breaching the terms of his licence following his release from prison. Kemi and Andrew split in . Bar worker Meghan is thought to have been dating the Reading-born expat for around three months when she was mowed down.

The Scharer family beat  other finalists to move to the idyllic Bardsey Island off North Wales to work as wardens. Farmer Ned, , and his we Sophie, , were due to spend three years on the island managing the nature reserve, a farm and bird observatory with their two children. But on day one -year-old son Sam fell shortly after stepping off the boat and was taken to hospital with a leg injury - and went home with his mum to heal. Ned was left to manage the island on his own and lasted a little over a month, but quickly realised the task ahead was too much for him.  Mrs Scharer said: It was such a shame but in the end, it made the decision to leave the island easier for us because we effectively had no choice. What happened was just one of those things. It could have happened anywhere. Mrs Scharer said Sam had slipped on rocks and had to be taken to hospital by helicopter where he was treated for a leg injury. She said: The warden has a direct line to the coastguard, so even though youaposre on the island, you have this amazing back-up. The seas were too rough to launch the boat so they sent the helicopter.    Sam has only recently healed but he now has a beautul scar in the shape of the island. Itaposs a wonderful souvenir. She said husband Ned found maintaining the island - which has , visitors each year - proved too much for him, and the family have now ed home to Llanwrst in Snowdonia. The mile-long island is known as the Island of , Saints and is said to be the final resting place of thousands of pilgrims. It is now famed for its wildle and rugged scenery - attracting seals, Manx shearwaters, porpoises and dolphins.    Bardsey Island Trust is now seeking new wardens to manage the remote island for the next three years. Wardens are paid an £, salary and offered accommodation and utilities on the island. According to the trust, candidates must be physically fit, comfortable with isolation - and prepared for no phone signal.  Mrs Scharer said: Itaposs an amazing opportunity for a family who love to spend time together and to have an adventure.

The monster couple, who cannot be named to protect their children, kept one of their sons locked naked in a squalid excrement-covered bedroom with no mattress or light bulb. The boy was also subjected to beatings, having his genitals squeezed as punishment, and fed scraps of food left by the other children in the house. His siblings were ordered to beat their brother as a punishment and they themselves were made to sleep on bare, dirty mattresses with springs poking out of them. This all happened while the couple, from Northampton, slept in their own clean, fully-furnished bedroom and kept several perfectly usable mattresses locked in a spare bedroom. The parents - who abused the children over a seven year period - showed no emotion after they were convicted of six counts of wilful neglect and child cruelty at Northampton Crown Court.     The father was jailed for a total of  years to run concurrently meaning he will actually serve seven years behind bars. The mother was sentenced to a total of . years but will serve just three and a half years in prison. The court heard that when police raided the coupleaposs home in  they found one of the boyaposs bedroom covered in excrement. A lock and an exterior alarm were fixed to the door and the blind over the curtain was nailed in place. Jailing the couple, His Honour Judge Michael Fowler said: It was nothing less than a cell. When the jury first saw the photographs of the conditions in which [that boy] was kept, they must have wondered what explanation you could advance for what they were looking at. And you could do nothing but tell obvious lies and ignore the reality of the offending. During the five-week trial, the father claimed he did not realise the extent of filthy, unhygienic conditions in the boyaposs bedroom. The judge called this defence fancul, and the jury took only three hours to convict the pair. Addressing the father, the judge said: The children in this case have suffered serious psychological, developmental and emotional harm. He told the pair: Both of you were found guilty of the most serious offences on this indictment. Central to this case is the horric cruelty shown to one boy in particular and it is dficult to contemplate anything much worse than the circumstances in which he was kept. You managed to conceal the extent of your neglect and abuse and you chose to home school a child, a process which is a complete farce, without having the necessary ability or equipment to do so. In fact, no schooling took place and it was during this period of so-called home schooling the neglect of this child reached its height. Not only did you abuse him but you encouraged his siblings to join in. All the children involved have suffered severe emotional and psychological harm at your hands, having been subjected to multiple acts of violence and cruelty over a long period of time. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Nicky Webb, of Northamptonshire Police, said: In  years of working in Child Protection I have never before encountered abuse and neglect on this scale. The investigation involved taking evidence from young children who were asked to recall traumatic and distressing events from their past, recounting details of horric psychological and emotional abuse.

Chelsie Thomas, , was rushed to hospital in March last year after suffering a potentially le-threatening ectopic pregnancy. Despite “clear and unambiguous” ultra-scan results showing the ectopic pregnancy was in her right fallopian tube, surgeons removed the left one, which was healthy. The horric blunder was only discovered a week later when Chelsie was rushed back to hospital after suffering crippling stomach pains. Medics were forced to remove the right fallopian tube which now means Chelsie is unable to conceive naturally without IVF treatment.    Chelsie, from Walsall, West Mids., who has a six-year-old son Riley-Jay, said the mistake at Walsall Manor Hospital “destroyed everything. She said: “I have had to explain to my son that he cannot have a brother or sister. I have had to leave my job because I canapost face going back there and I am going to have to have therapy because itaposs getting worse not better. Chelsie also says her relationship with her partner broke down as a result of the surgery and she has also lost her job and is on anti-depressants.    She added: “None of this seems real. I am heartbroken and just feel numb at what has happened and devastated at how I can no longer have children naturally. “After I came round from my first operation I felt really ill. I was in so much pain which continued throughout the day. “The next day the doctor who carried out the surgery came to see me and at this point told me that the operations went really well and I was told I go home that morning. “Shortly after I got home I received a call asking me to go back to hospital for a scan.  “As I was being scanned I said that I thought that the ectopic pregnancy had been\u2028 removed and then I saw my baby’s heartbeat on the screen. “I started to cry instantly. I couldn’t speak as I was lost for words. “It has been dficult to come to terms with the fact that I have not only had unnecessary surgery but have been left unable to have more children naturally. “I had planned on having two more children as I come from a large family. I wanted Riley-Jay to grow up with little brothers and sisters.  “The hospital has classed this as a ‘never event’ and it is dficult to understand how this has happened. I just hope that it doesn’t happen to anyone .” Her ectopic pregnancy was discovered after she suffered bleeding and went to Walsall Manor Hospital on March  last year. She had surgery the same day, where her healthy fallopian tube was removed by mistake. But a week later, when she was still in excruciating pain, she ed to hospital where the blunder was discovered. An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes, the NHS says. If an egg gets stuck in one of the fallopian tubes - which connect the oies to the womb - it wonapost develop into a baby and the womanaposs health may be at risk of the pregnancy continues. It is not possible to save the pregnancy, and it usually has to be removed using medication or an operation. About one in every  pregnancies - or , a year - in the UK is ectopic, the NHS says. If symptoms develop they tend to surface between the fourth and th weeks of pregnancy. They can include a missed period and other signs of pregnancy, tummy pain, vaginal bleeding or a brown watery discharge, shoulder pain or discomfort when urinating or defecating. In serious cases, symptoms can include a sharp pain in the tummy, dizziness or fainting, feeling sick or looking very pale, and they require immediate treatment. Those symptoms could mean the fallopian tube has split open , a situation that can be le-threatening. In many cases the cause of an ectopic pregnancy is not clear, but it sometimes happens when there is a problem with the fallopian tubes, such as being narrow or blocked. Chelsie approached solicitors Irwin Mitchell to examine her case, and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust apologised, saying the mistake was classed as a “never event. The serious incident investigation report said that the registrar and consultant involved in the first surgery seemed not to have given “appropriate weight” to the original scan result “which demanded a forensic examination of the right tube and oy, which clearly did not take place. If Chelsie’s right tube had been “inspected throughout its entirethe ectopic pregnancy should have been discovered and removed, the report stated. Without the intervention of staff, who flagged concerns about Chelsie’s care, it is likely her fallopian tube would have ruptured, a potentially le-threatening condition, the Trust said.  It admitted liability and has offered to pay for one round of IVF for Chelsie. Solicitor Jenna Harris: “Understandably Chelsie has been devastated by the events that unfolded and she is still struggling to come to terms with not only losing a child, but also the fact that she faces the possibility of not being able to have more children in the future. “Ectopic pregnancies can be extremely dangerous and Chelsie’s care has raised a number of very worrying questions. “The Trust’s own findings in its internal investigation report are quite damning. “While nothing can make up for what Chelsie has had to go through, we recognise that the Trust has admitted liability and made several recommendations in its incident report. “We urge it to ensure these recommendations are implemented as soon as possible to improve patient care for others.” Dr Matthew Lewis, the medical director at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, admitted surgeons made a mistake, and said: “Our care fell below the standard that we would expect.” He added that the trust worked with patients and their families, our own clinicians and staff to learn lessons and put systems in place to try and avoid such incidents.

Jade Rist, , said she knew the habit jeopardised her unborn children - but refused to pack it in until she lost her fourth baby. The mum from Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, smoked  cigarettes every day throughout six pregnancies. Only two were successful. The -year-old has now backed an NHS anti-smoking campaign and says she has finally managed to ditch tobacco in preparation for her seventh pregnancy. According to the NHS, smoking tobacco is not proven to cause miscarriages - but lighting up can increase the overall risk. Jade said: Iaposve had a lot of experience of miscarriage and I do believe it is to do with smoking - I always blamed myself.  She continued: I also had problems with my daughter at birth that could have been caused by having the odd fag. Not even doctors can say  per cent smoking caused the miscarriages but that has made me more determined to quit. It made me realise I needed to do something and just thought smoking is the only thing in my le which is bad. I was determined to get pregnant again and it wasnapost fair to keep miscarrying - I always blamed myself, but this time I canapost. She decided it was time to quit with the help of an NHS smoke-free home visits adviser after suffering a miscarriage last year. Jade said: I have more time for my children. I used to go downstairs in the morning and my fag was more important than my children. I used to be aposyou can wait, Iaposm going out for a fagapos, which they donapost understand. Iaposm much happier in myself - I always used to be angry because Iaposm waiting for my next fag or playing less because Iaposm thinking about my next one.  NHS data found more than  per cent of expectant mothers in Thanet, Kent and three other districts smoke during their terms. While the South Kent Coast has the most amount of smokers, with more than  per cent of pregnant mums lighting up. NHS adviser Claire Stagg said: We know second and third-hand smoke result higher incidents of illness in children, lower immune system, eczema , asthma and ear problems. Even when smoking at a window, the smoke is pushed into your home and settles on the floor and sofa and thataposs where we put baby, so theyaposre picking up those chemicals from the smoke. Weaposre talking about this so much more and mums are told this when they leave hospital which didnapost happen a couple of years ago. Studies have revealed the links between second-hand smoke and behavioural issues children suffer, including autism and ADHD.    Evidence has shown quitting smoking benefits a babyaposs health within  hours as carbon monoxide in smoke leaves the mother. Jade said she feels this information is vital for mothers to know as it shows how quickly they can help their babies by quitting. She said: Itaposs selfish doing it, they didnapost ask to be there and theyaposre craving it too. Itaposs hard and youaposve got to have that will power and no one is going to judge you. Itaposs changed things dramatically and weaposre seeing far more pregnant women since we started home visits than previously.

Oxford University student and beer enthusiast Jack Weatherilt has been branded an aposeveryday heroapos after he spent part of his holiday on the drinking tool. The website uses data from the pub chainaposs app to rank over  drinks by their the alcohol-to-price ratio at every JD Wetherspoons establishment in the country. Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, the computer science and philosophy student said: Itaposs always been a bit of a game trying to get good value alcohol and working out whataposs the most cost-effective way to get drunk, whether thataposs in Tesco or at a pub, so having a way to work it out was the only way to settle it. Going to the Ice Wharf in Camden before a gig inspired me to make this because of how absurdly expensive it was for a Spoons, so the websiteaposs presentation had to be efficient.    Alcohol rankings y according to the branch, but Magners and Abbot Ale regularly come out on top for value, whereas Peach schnapps and vodka monster rank poorly. Users select their local Wetherspoons and the full rankings appear. The website automatically updates whenever the deals or menu changes in a particular branch. Since the data comes from the Wetherspoonsapos official app, only drinks in stock feature in the rankings. Jack quashed any doubt over the websiteaposs purpose, confirming he visits Wetherspoons pubs with his friends to get drunk on a budget.    The websiteaposs founder admitted spending too long trying to perfect the siteaposs design but says he is pleased with the result. Jack added: Since Iaposm doing computer science, Iaposve done some programming and website stuff which made it fairly simple to put the site together. I had to kind of take apart the Spoons app to see how it was getting the drinks data, and then imitate that process with my website to get all the data and calculate the value for each drink.

Mike Anthony Addison was driving Rude Napier to her final check-up along with their three children on Friday when the mum-of-four suddenly went into labour. The coupleaposs eldest son, Jayden, , had been filming a pre-birth video for his new sister Jolee Lavergne but ended up filming her birth instead.The footage, which Mike decided to later share on Facebook , shows the calm family heading to the hospital.Suddenly the situation starts to escalate, with Rudy saying to her husband Mike the babyaposs coming out, Mile the babyaposs coming outapos. Mike replies to her, by saying aposno, sheaposs notapos, refusing to believe what was about to happen.    But he quickly realises whataposs happening and turns to the camera, being held by Jayden, and says, Hey Jolee, itaposs your father. Just want to let you know youaposre making a grand presence in my car. Weaposre on our way to the hospital. We love you and weaposll see you soon. We just wanna say a prayer and just pray and ask God that youaposre delivered safely and healthy and we just canapost wait to put our hands on you. Jayden then flips the camera around and jokingly says Hurry up.    Meanwhile, his sisters can be seen in tears as their mum continues to push. As Jolee emerges, Mike says: Hold her up, hold her up, oh, my God, hold her up while Rudy says, I got her and pulls Jolee to her chest. Mike notices Rudyaposs worry that the baby hasnapost made a noise yet, and reassures her that Joleeaposs eyes are open. The family eventually got to Henderson Hospital where staff rushed Rudy and Jolee to a ward on a wheelchair and the newborn was checked out and given the all-clear.  Sharing the extraordinary moment on Facebook on Saturday night, Mike thanked the hospital for taking car of his we and child. He said: I just want to take the time to thank the ENTIRE Henderson Hospital staff for all the great immediate help and hospitality they gave us from start to finish!!!!  aposThey treated us like ROYALTY there from the minute I sped up to the front door running in like a maniac screaming for help until they were wheeling Rudy and Jolee down to me earlier today so we could finally go home.Rudy later told Fox : Iaposve never been through anything like that in my le, and Iaposve done some crazy stuff.

Alongside this, she wrote: Ladies... u got a freckle on the middle of ur wrist or is this a myth lmao.Her post quickly went viral, with over , people liking it and , people retweeting.More than , women also responded, with many saying they initially thought it was a joke, but then realised they DID in fact have a freckle in the same place.    Freckles are little brown specks or spots on the skin, caused by a pigment called melanin. They form on the skin when there is a high deposit of melanin in one area and can become darker when exposed to sunlight, as this increases the production of mealnin. Wrists may be a common place to find freckles, due to the amount of light that catches the exposed skin there.According to Nivea, nobody is born with freckles, they typically start to develop during childhood. But your genes can play a big role in determining whether youaposll get freckles, soa family member is prone to freckled skin, chances are you will be too.   People had lots of thoughts about the freckle, with one person branding it magical.

Brave photographer Alex Suh captured the moment the beast sunk its jaws into a cage he was scuba ing in - inches from his face - after mistaking it for a chunk of tuna. Alex, from Calornia, USA, visits Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, every year to study the behaviour of the huge apex predators - but this is the closest heaposs ever got to their teeth. He says he wasnapost scared at all about his safety and was mostly worried about the shark getting trapped.    Alex said: I was taking images with my underwater camera rig when a great white shark came to feed on tuna chunk that is tied to a break away line and float. The shark was going for the tuna and rolled its eyes back, a normal instinct to protect their vulnerable eyes, and could not see the cage when it grabbed the tuna chunk and hit the cage while trying to eat. The shark ended up using the cage as leverage to swallow the tuna and then swam away. I was leaning forward slightly outside the cage when it came towards me where I stuck my head body back in as it was just inches above my head.  Until that time I had never witnessed that before. It was doing what it naturally does when eating dead or dying fish. Without sharks our oceans and reefs would be ruinedthey did not clean the ocean of dead and diseased animals- the waters would continue to be polluted from the decay.

He came in for harsh criticism after the - defeat and admitted he feared for his international future.However, Clarke revealed the Derby County-bound -year-old – who played through the pain of an ankle injury in the last two games of the Reds’ season – expressed his love for pulling on the dark blue of Scotland.

The ex-Hamilton Accies skipper was set to make his international debut under McLeish, but was injured in training in November.As a result, the -year-old only made five starts since early November.All in, Clarke has included five uncapped players in his squad.The others are Livingston goalkeeper Liam Kelly and his former Rugby Park charges Stuart Findlay, Greg Taylor and Eamonn Brophy.Clarke said the time of year he is trying to shape his squad meant some of those he wanted to call up were unavailable, with others missing out due to injury.He said: “This squad of players all want to be here and that’s the main thing for me.“It’s dficult for the ones I called last week and tried to convince to cancel weddings that they’ve had organised for the last two years or whatever.“It’s really dficult to do that with people.“We have to be understanding that this is the squad that’s available and I think it’s a good squad.“Hopefully in the games you’ll see that.”Clarke said there are “conversations to be had on every single one of” the players missing from the contingent this time.Among the injured are Kieran Tierney and Ryan Christie , Callum Paterson , David Bates , Ryan Jackand Liam Cooper .Steven Fletcher has asked to be rested, while his Sheffield Wednesday team-mate Barry Bannan wasn’t considered for selection and John Fleckis set to get married on June . Players like Newcastle’s Matt Ritchie remain in international exile.Nevertheless, Clarke thinks he can get two results in his first two matches as Scotland manager, adding: “There’s enough talent in that squad to get results in both games, I’m convinced of that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/5ce7ea0f81ca81.61891080.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet maisie lance and chopper are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Maisie is an energetic girl who will need an active owner to keep up with her.The Border Terrier Patterdale cross is very affectionate but is not suitable to be homed around young children and would need to be the only pet in the household.The five-and-a-half year old, who is neutered, is not good with other dogs and would need to be muzzled when out walking.Lance is a lovely boy and gets on with everyone he meets.There is no previous history on how he is around other animals or children, but he enjoys daily cuddles and snuggling up on a sofa.We have no previous history on how he is around other animals or children.Lance, who is around four years old, is a typical German Shepherd who likes to make himself heard.Staffie Chopper is a shy boy who would like a quiet home where he is the only pet and can get all the attention he deserves.Chopper, who is around nine and has been neutered, loves to play with his toys so will need a secure garden where he can run around and have fun.There is no previous history on how he is around other animals or children.Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42816996-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42816996-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42816996-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.42816996-2-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"flats plan for former aberdeen school delayed","story":"The decision to award a contract for more than  council homes has been delayed.As reported by the Evening Express earlier this month, council officers had assured city councillors a contract for the development on the site of the former Summerhill Education Centre would be awarded “in the coming weeks”.However, a report to the capital programme committee has said more work will need to be done before the contract can be awarded.Prepared by council officers, the report said investigations are set to take place into a new eco-friendly energy model of heating and electricity as well as a new method of foundation design.It said: “Given the changes to project design and specication, especially in relation to foundation design, it is prudent to allow these issues to be puried before awarding a construction contract in order to mitigate against potential claims.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c247b270fff1.jpg ","title":"fresh delay for aberdeens hall of heroes at provost skenes house","story":"The opening date for a new Aberdeen attraction has been pushed back again – and the budget for the work is £. million more than originally anticipated.A new report shows the opening date for the Hall for Heroes at Provost Skene’s House is now expected to be autumn .The report also states the budget for the project is £.m – compared to £.m cited in .The restoration was initially hoped to have been completed by July , however, there were delays due to construction issues.At the time, finance convener and council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said he hoped the historic building would be open at the beginning of this year.It is now expected a construction contract will be awarded next month.Problems have been identied as part of the project, however, the report states the age of the building may lead to further problems being identied once work begins.It says: “There are construction and budgetary risks when dealing with such an old building the primary one is that we are dealing with the unknown.“When the works commence to disturb the existing external and internal fabric of the building, there is a signicant risk that we may uncover some challenges in the form of unusual or unexpected issues.“This could range from dry rot or wet rot through to structural issues with the building.”Plans in place to celebrate heroes at Aberdeen#s Provost Skene House\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local plans-in-place-to-celebrate-heroes-at-aberdeens-provost-skene-house embed #

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Many visitors also took a seat around the #have-a-go# table to learn more and make their own pompom caterpillar or plant, take up a bit of cross stitch or find out about the art of decoupage – a staple of the immensely popular activity of upcycling, while others took advantage of the opportunity to sit outside the hall enjoying delicious home-made cakes washed down with tea or coffee.Co-organiser Ruth Tott commented: #The idea of the craft day just grew and grew, with one thing leading to another. One of the many fun attractions, our popular ‘scarecrow’ knitter, came about by accident after an old rusty garden chair was donated then renovated with the aid of brightly-coloured spray paint, after which it was simply crying out for a body to sit on it.#Plans are already afoot for next year’s event – surely a must following such a success.Another one of the organisers, Val Whale, added: #We’re holding a post-mortem with the craft group members this week to discuss what worked, what didn’t work, and what we can do better next year.#Many from the community have already pledged their support, showing how crafting is so much more than just a hobby and can help forge friendships as well as passing on what can become a lelong skill.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Traditionally the Lordship was held by the MacDonald family.However, following disputes in the fteenth century the Scottish kings sought to curtail the MacDonalds’ influence, and in the s James IV sent a military expedition to sack Finlaggan. Many of the buildings at Finlaggan were destroyed at this time, and over the centuries that followed the site sank into relative obscurity.The reconstruction shows what Finlaggan may have looked like in its glory days when it was the seat of the Council of the Lords of the Isles, and the scene of inauguration ceremonies for the Lords.It depicts the twin islands of Eilean Morand Eilean na Comhairle , and their surroundings on Loch Finlaggan. Interestingly, by the late Middle Ages, the Lords of the Isles’ residence at Finlaggan had little in the way of defensive structures – possibly indicating how secure the MacDonalds felt in the heart of their powerbase on Islay.The reconstruction will be available as an interactive virtual reality experience at the Finlaggan Trust’s visitor centre on Islay. There is also a virtual reality app and an online video.Dr Bess Rhodes said: #Finlaggan was an amazing place to recreate digitally. Even today the islands of Eilean Mor and Eilean na Comhairle are beautul places, and in the Middle Ages they were the site of a remarkable complex of buildings which blended local traditions with wider European trends.#The work by Dr David Caldwell and the Finlaggan Archaeological Project has transformed our understanding of this site – giving us a glimpse of the relative comfort in which the Lords of the Isles and their followers lived, pampering their dogs with decorative collars, and enjoying music, imported wine and board games.#Dr Ray Lafferty, Secretary of the Finlaggan Trust, said: #Despite its impact on the shaping of Scottish culture, Finlaggan and the Lordship remains little known to many.#With this virtual reality reconstruction, we hope to give some sense of the site at the zenith of its power, when MacDonald rule stretched from the Glens of Antrim in Ireland to Buchan in the northeast of Scotland.#PICS:The Great Hall interior. no_aFinlagganReconstructionA general view of the islands. no_aFinlagganReconstructionA peaceful Finlaggan today # but it was not always so quiet. aFinlagganMedieval grave slabs among the ruins of Finlaggan. aFinlaggan"},{"url":null,"title":"three amigos clean up in lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFed up with the amount of rubbish left in the area, Flora Currie, Campbell Ferguson and Iain MacDougall # with support from staff at Lochgilphead Resource Centre # recently carried out a litter pick around the path known as Tesco lane near the resource centre.The collected all sorts of items, from polystyrene takeaway food boxes to bicycle frames.The message from the intrepid trio was: #We care about our environment.#"},{"url":null,"title":"dry spell restricts boats on crinan canal","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDue to the continued exceptionally dry period of weather, and the impact on water resource on the Crinan reservoirs, Scottish Canals have issued the following notice to boat owners restricting passage.Vessels with Deep Draught: From close of business on Friday May  until further notice, Scottish Canals will be unable to offer passage to vessels with a FRESH WATER draught over .m.In addition to this, Scottish Canals would ask that those on passage conserve water by sharing locks with others.A spokesperson continued: #In particular we would ask that you maintain groups on the flights between locks five and  so that we may minimise the water drawn from the summit reach.#We may be required to hold single vessels for a short period to make effective use of the lock.

Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local

can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and

are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose authority."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-best-young-golfers-about-to-descend-on-east-lothian","story":"They will battle it out for top spots in the tournament, which will be played at Musselburgh GC,

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9898940.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-these-hidden-gems-in-stirlingshire-and-perthshire","story":"INNERPEFFRAY LIBRARYThe spectacular Library and School at Innerpeffray were founded by David Drummond rd Lord Madertie in around , the first free public lending library in Scotland.

country is on alert over water scarcity due to low rainfall levels in April and May.Scottish Water has asked parts of the Western Isles and Argyll to make conservation efforts by taking shorter showers and only washing car windscreens and lights instead of the whole vehicle.Those affected currently involve customers served by the Tolsta Water Treatment Worksin north Lewis and by the Tarbert WTW in Argyll are being asked to take steps to save water.Other water conservation measures suggested include using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket to wash vehicles and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has placed a Moderate Scarcity orange alert in Argyll, the Western Isles, and the northwest of the country.A yellow water scarcity alert exists everywhere  except the Northern Isles and south Scotland, which have an early warning in place.The agency has issued a request to farmers and golf course managers in all areas of Scotland except the south region when using water from burns and small rivers to only irrigate only when necessary and at night to cut evaporation losses.It said water sources used for irrigation of farmland to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate are at risk of becoming \"limited\" in all areas of Scotland.The agency also suggested farmers explore how they and their neighbours in the same river catchment could avoid irrigating at the same time.SEPA said: \"River levels are still extremely low across western Scotland, particularly in the north-west.\"Further evidence of environmental impacts and impacts on private water supplies have been reported and therefore a Moderate Scarcity level has been set for this area.\"Some rainfall is forecast for the north west in the week ahead but it is not yet clear how much this will ease the situation.\"In each river catchment there is some degree of water storage, which can maintain river flows even when it is not raining.This natural water storage is mainly held in lochs and groundwater.SEP says that when natural storage has been depleted it will take a lot of rainfall for levels to recover.Currently loch levels in the north-west were described as \"low for the time of year\" following relatively dry conditions.And groundwater levels along the east coast were described as \"still very low for the time of year\".Scottish Water said that reservoir levels across Scotland were currently at  per cent and \"generally good\".But it said that despite some rainfall in parts of the country at the weekend, Scottish Water hydrologists say it has not helped to replenish to any signicant level water sources in certain areas.A Scottish Water spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore asking customers in these two areas, Tolsta on Lewis and Tarbert in Kintyre, to consider how they use their water and to follow our advice about how they can use water wisely.ldquoThe weather in these areas during most of April and May has been very dry and there has been a drop in reservoir levels that supply the water treatment works which serve our customers there.ldquoWe have a strong and resilient distribution network to keep our customers supplied, but wersquore asking everyone to play their part by considering what they can do to help us maintain supplies.Scottish Water is to attend a series of events across the country over summer as part of a Your Water Your Le campaign to talk to communities about how to use water wisely."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9914076.jpg?type=article-full","title":"in-pictures-iconic-leith-art-deco-cinema-homes-plan-gets-go-ahead","story":"The Glencairn

to replace her to claim they can strike a swt and better deal with Brussels.Boris Johnson and other hardline Brexiters have claimed they could force the EU to sht its position on the Irish backstop that bedevilled Mrs May.But European Commission president Jean Claude-Juncker yesterday dismissed notions of the EU falling into line for a new Prime Minister, saying: ldquoThere will be no renegotiation.It came as the race for Number  intensied as the field expanded to  with the entry of two more Tory MPs - junior Brexit minister James Cleverly and the former deputy mayor of London under Mr Johnson, Kit Malthouse.Mr Malthouse gave his name to the Malthouse compromise, a plan to replace the Irish backstop with alternative arrangements, that the EU and Number  said was unworkable.Also standing are Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Appearing for the first time in public since announcing her resignation timetable last Friday, Mrs May said her successor had to find ldquoconsensus with other  EU states.At a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss replacements for Mr Juncker and EU Council president Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister admitted the European election results had been ldquodeeply disappointing for the Tories, who collapsed to fth place on a .% vote share.A victory for Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party has seen Tory leadership contenders sht towards a no-deal Brexit in order to fend off a possible general election challenge from the new party.Mrs May said: ldquoIrsquove always taken a view that the best option for the UK is to leave the European Union with a deal. Irsquom not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates.ldquoThere will be a process of selecting my successor as leader of the Conservative party but I continue to have the view that itrsquos best for the UK to leave with a deal.She went on: ldquoOf course the European election results were deeply disappointing for the party. What it shows is the importance of actually delivering Brexit.ldquoI think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit.Mr Hunt, who has the most number of declared supporters among MPs, warned a no-deal Brexit would be ldquopolitical suicide for the Tories.The Foreign Secretary said MPs would block it with a no confidence vote that would force a general election which would probably ldquoannihilate the Tories and ldquoput Jeremy Corbyn in No  by Christmas.He said he would try to reopen negotiations with the EU to achieve a ldquodferent deal.He said: ldquoThat means negotiations that take us out of the customs union while generously respecting legitimate concerns about the Irish border. Why would the EU leaders do that  Because they do not want the shadow of Brexit hanging over them. Go to them with a shared problem and there is a chance of a shared solution.Mr Stewart, the only candidate to rule out no-deal, hit back at suggestions he was a ldquosuicide bomber who was only in the race to clear a path for Mr Gove.He said the remark was in bad taste given his diplomatic experience in Iraq and blamed supporters of Mr Johnson who were worried by his run.The International Development Secretary said: ldquoIrsquom not running tactically - I am running on principle and because I believe we can uny this country and make it a much better place.He also outlined plans for setting up a salaried citizens assembly of  members of the public who would be paid to work out a Brexit plan instead of parliament. He said he had been inspired by Irelandrsquos assembly on abortion.He told the : ldquoI have a lot of confidence that we are one of the most educated and articulate populations on Earth and thatwe had a citizensrsquo assembly they would be able to do what parliament has failed to do: step back, put party politics aside and look at a sensible resolution to this.ldquoYou need a Brexit deal to last for  years ndash the danger of revoke or no deal is that you end up in a very unstable situation. The issues are set up as very binary but actually in Ireland they broke it down to a whole series of dferent questions.Sir Nicholas Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, backed Mr Stewart as the only candidate ldquowho can sort out Brexit, unite our party and restore pride and hope to Britain.Mr Raab launched a campaign video emphasising ldquofairness and said he would like a ldquolegally binding exchange of letters to give the UK a clear exit from the so-called backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"calmac-campaigners-cast-light-on-pier-that-is-too-dark-to-be-safe","story":"Craignure Pier on Mull has weathered the worst of west coast storms, up to  ferries a day and the weight of an astonishing annual , passengers.Now a new dossier of correspondence reveals that it has withstood it all with only the most basic of maintenance.Neglect, say campaigners, means the  concrete and timber jetty is now more than showing its age and earlier this year the structure had to be closed after a piece broke away.Locals and visitors alike are worried and so is Caledonian MacBrayne, the state-owned company whose ferry service from Oban docks at Craignure.After this springrsquos problems a local group, the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee, used Freedom of Information laws to find out just how bad the situation was. It discovered the jetty, owned by Argyll and Bute Council, has lighting that is so bad ferries sometimes had to be cancelled.Ferry committee chairwoman Elizabeth Ferguson said the revelations had been shocking.She said: ldquoAn email of    states: ldquoThe lack of lighting, especially at the pump shed linkspan is causing us serious issues. We had a near miss this morning. Can you please have these addressed as soon as possible Another concerning email from CalMac in  states: ldquoPump shed roof leaking, water dripping into light fittings. Please deal with as a matter of urgency.Fteen months later CalMac raises the leaking roof problem again, emailing the council to say: ldquoAs has been advised for some time now, the pump shed roof leaks into a light fitting, which can be seen smoking inside. This has potential for causing a fire. Can you address ASAP.In October , another email from CalMac reveals: ldquoThe guys are having great dficulty in seeing the heaving lines being thrown during the hours of darkness. The pierhead LED was swapped for sodium, we have repeatedly asked for it to be changed back, but it has never been done.Mrs Ferguson said: ldquoIn the weekly checklists submitted by CalMac between January  and December , lighting faults have been reported on  weeks out of . In other words, over that seven-year period, the pier lighting was only reported fault-free for just  weeks.ldquoPoor lighting at Craignure pier is repeatedly cited by CalMac as one of the reasons for cancellations in hours of darkness and inclement weather, yet the evidence of the weekly checklist and the email correspondence is that not only is the lighting system very poor, but repairs take a long time to be completed.Mrs Ferguson added: ldquoThe port weekly checklists from  to December  report a fender fault of one kind or another for  weeks out of , ie for only  weeks out of seven years did the weekly checklists report that there were no fender faults. Improvements seem to be completely absent. Upgrade of Craignure street lights and pier lighting to LED has been promised for several years, but has yet to materialise.ldquoThe water supply has been leaking without a permanent fix for five years.Craignure Pier is not alone in facing questions over whether it is fit for purpose. Argyll  Bute Council has long faced criticism for the state of infrastructure along a coastline that is longer than Francersquos.It has a multi-million-pound linkspan in Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula that has no car ferry to service. Its pier at Helensburgh has lost its once regular Clyde ferries and needs pound million worth of repairs.Over the years there has been a pattern of problems, such as the specially built jetty extension at Bruichladdich that often could not handle the fuel tanker needed for Islayrsquos whisky distilleries.Islanders and coastal communities are angry, not least because piers make money. CalMacrsquos Oban-Craignure Service is its second busiest. The emails obtained under FoI, including CalMacrsquos weekly port reports, show Argyll  Bute spent only pound, on pier repairs and maintenance, over seven years while it received more than pound million in fees over the same period.Billy McClymont, chairman of Mull Community Council, speaking after the April closure, said: ldquoThe pier takes in almost pound.m a year. Itrsquos the golden goose and itrsquos a real slap in the teeth that they have spent nothing on the pier.Mr McClymont said the community council was set to join Coll, Colonsay and Tiree, in a new Confederation of Islands being planned to fight for a bigger political voice for islanders, as they claim they have been ignored for years by the council and the Scottish Government.This comes despite good news for the island.

These geriatric king-makers intend to install a leader in Nigel Faragersquos image, preferably Boris Johnson. He or she will then propel the UK into the self-inflicted turmoil of a No Deal Brexit.This is madness. Yet Scottish voters will be left watching this doomsday clock tick away inexorably till their economic welfare is sacriced on the altar of Brexit on Halloween. The prospect of No Deal may inspire a wartime spirit among Brexit voters, but the vast majority of Scottish voters see this as an act of wilful self-harm by a political elite who have lost the plot.The Scottish Governmentrsquos chief economic adviser says that No Deal could cost Scotland pound billion in less than a year. This on top of possible food and medicine shortages, and transport disruption as the UK severs its settled relations with its biggest trading partner. The longer-term impact of tarfs and lost markets could, according to the Scottish Government, cost , jobs in Scotland.Project fear  Perhaps. But not even the most starry-eyed Brexiter believes that No Deal would be cost-free. The question is: what can the Scottish government, and Holyrood, do to prevent this  Nicola Sturgeon says she wants an independence referendum in late , but by then, the damage will already have been done.I have argued against an advisory referendum on independence for the obvious reasons: Unionists would boycott it and Westminster would ignore it. But the way things are going, there may not be time to wait around for a Section  Order that never arrives. The situation is becoming critical.The Scottish Parliament needs to think carefully today about how it intends to respond to the reckless behaviour of the governing party in the UK.Gone are the visions of a smooth and orderly transition to Brexit, negotiated in goodwill with Brussels. Theresa Mayrsquos likely successors ndash Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey ndash are behaving like intoxicated football fans before an away match. ldquoCome on you Brussels they slur, ldquo you think yoursquore hard enough.Even those who would prefer negotiation, like the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are being swept way by No Deal fever. No sooner had he said that leaving without a deal would be ldquopolitical suicide than his rivals were vying with each other to don the suicide vest. They yearn for a breakdown in relations with Europe, the better to express their pugnacious nationalism.Theresa Mayrsquos EU Withdrawal Deal, which took two years to negotiate, is dead and another cannot be renegotiated before the end of the current Brextension on October . In fact, one of the conditions of the extension, we now learn, was that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened. There is, as Britainrsquos first female prime minister put it, no alternative.Anyway, there wonrsquot be a Brussels to negotiate with because both the President of the Council and the President of the European Commission are standing down and their successors wonrsquot be in place until November when Britain will already have left.This means Britain is heading like an express train for a clf-edge Brexit in five short months. And, as things stand, Scotland will be dragged over the precipice along with the rest of the UK. The game plan in the Brexit Bunker is for Prime Minister Boris, or whoever, to ignore Parliament, sit tight, and allow Britain to crash out by the remorseless legal logic of Article .Read more: Nicola Sturgeon plans for indyref next yearMany hope that Westminster will get its act together and block this ndash I certainly do. But there is no guarantee that our shell-shocked and confused MPs will be able to organise a successful no confidence motion to bring down the next prime minister and seize control. Nor is there a majority in Parliament for a repeat referendum, evenLabour were to persuade its dithering leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that it should support one. He says hersquoll think about it in September.Sothe House of Commons is now being held hostage by the Brexit revolutionaries, what can Holyrood do to save the day  Today, Nicola Sturgeon will unveil her bill for a repeat referendum, not on Europe, but on Scottish independence. However, todayrsquos bill does not actually legislate for Indyref . It merely provides the technical framework for a referendumand when Westminster agrees to make it legally binding by passing a Section  order. And the chances of that happening are precisely zero.For a start there is no prime minister to receive a Section  request. Theresa May has been reduced to the status of a piece of constitutional furniture for Donald Trumprsquos state visit. Her successor will be even less likely to contemplate breaking up the UK before the UK has departed from the EU. In fact, the prospect of any UK prime minister, Labour or Tory, agreeing to a Scottish referendum until well into the next decade seems remote.Yet, the case for a repeat referendum on Scottish independence is surely stronger than the case for the repeat Brexit referendum now advocated by Labour and the rejuvenated Liberal Democrats. Scots were told in  that only by remaining in the UK could they be sure of remaining in the EU. Now they are faced, not just with leaving Europe against their will, but crashing out of it in the worst possible terms. Material changes in circumstances donrsquot come much more material than this.Enough already. It may be necessary to advance the independence timetable and seek a test of Scottish opinion this autumn. At the very least, an advisory referendum would place on record that Scotland does not go willingly into the Brexit night."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leader","story":"The answer, of course, might be a bit of all three, and a lot more besides.

It discovered the jetty, owned by Argyll and Bute Council, has lighting that is so bad ferries sometimes had to be cancelled.Ferry committee chairwoman Elizabeth Ferguson said the revelations had been shocking.She said: ldquoAn email of    states: ldquoThe lack of lighting, especially at the pump shed linkspan is causing us serious issues. We had a near miss this morning. Can you please have these addressed as soon as possible Another concerning email from CalMac in  states: ldquoPump shed roof leaking, water dripping into light fittings. Please deal with as a matter of urgency.Fteen months later CalMac raises the leaking roof problem again, emailing the council to say: ldquoAs has been advised for some time now, the pump shed roof leaks into a light fitting, which can be seen smoking inside. This has potential for causing a fire. Can you address ASAP.In October , another email from CalMac reveals: ldquoThe guys are having great dficulty in seeing the heaving lines being thrown during the hours of darkness. The pierhead LED was swapped for sodium, we have repeatedly asked for it to be changed back, but it has never been done.Mrs Ferguson said: ldquoIn the weekly checklists submitted by CalMac between January  and December , lighting faults have been reported on  weeks out of . In other words, over that seven-year period, the pier lighting was only reported fault-free for just  weeks.ldquoPoor lighting at Craignure pier is repeatedly cited by CalMac as one of the reasons for cancellations in hours of darkness and inclement weather, yet the evidence of the weekly checklist and the email correspondence is that not only is the lighting system very poor, but repairs take a long time to be completed.Mrs Ferguson added: ldquoThe port weekly checklists from  to December  report a fender fault of one kind or another for  weeks out of , ie for only  weeks out of seven years did the weekly checklists report that there were no fender faults. Improvements seem to be completely absent. Upgrade of Craignure street lights and pier lighting to LED has been promised for several years, but has yet to materialise.ldquoThe water supply has been leaking without a permanent fix for five years.Craignure Pier is not alone in facing questions over whether it is fit for purpose. Argyll  Bute Council has long faced criticism for the state of infrastructure along a coastline that is longer than Francersquos.It has a multi-million-pound linkspan in Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula that has no car ferry to service. Its pier at Helensburgh has lost its once regular Clyde ferries and needs pound million worth of repairs.Over the years there has been a pattern of problems, such as the specially built jetty extension at Bruichladdich that often could not handle the fuel tanker needed for Islayrsquos whisky distilleries.Islanders and coastal communities are angry, not least because piers make money. CalMacrsquos Oban-Craignure Service is its second busiest. The emails obtained under FoI, including CalMacrsquos weekly port reports, show Argyll  Bute spent only pound, on pier repairs and maintenance, over seven years while it received more than pound million in fees over the same period.Billy McClymont, chairman of Mull Community Council, speaking after the April closure, said: ldquoThe pier takes in almost pound.m a year. Itrsquos the golden goose and itrsquos a real slap in the teeth that they have spent nothing on the pier.Mr McClymont said the community council was set to join Coll, Colonsay and Tiree, in a new Confederation of Islands being planned to fight for a bigger political voice for islanders, as they claim they have been ignored for years by the council and the Scottish Government.This comes despite good news for the island. A new ferry is needed to handle a  per cent increase in the routersquos traffic as a result of the introduction of Road Equivalent Tarf in .But Craignure is not big enough for bigger ships. A recent Scottish Transport Analysis Guide appraisal stated that the north and south berths at the pier were too short for larger ferries.Meanwhile, CalMac has its own headaches, including an ageing fleet, with many past their lespans and more than  years old."},{"url":null,"title":"fishing-vessel-and-tanker-in-overnight-collision-off-ayrshire-coast","story":"The Troon RNLI all-weather leboat was sent to the scene around fivenautical miles south-west of the town after the alarm was raised at .am on Wednesday.:Polly Rodger: Plastic fishing boat tour to highlight pollution in Scotlandrsquos watersNo-one was injured but the fishing vesselsuffered damage to its bow.CALLOUT: At .am on Wednesday  May , Belfast Coastguard requested the launch of Troon RNLI all-weather leboat following a collision between two vessels approximately  nautical miles south west of Troon. https:t.co SLprLrfAlC pic udYdNdxTjmdash RNLI Troon LeboatMay , The marine protection vesselMinna, which was in the area, also went to the scene to assist.The leboat escorted the fishing vessel back to Troon harbour while the tanker remained at anchor.Marine Scotland tweeted: ldquoEarly this morning #MPVMinna was asked to assist @TroonLeboat and @BelfastRnli with a tanker and fishing boat that had collided at sea.ldquoBoth vessels and all crew are now safe and our thanks go to all involved."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-leadership-hopefuls-rule-out-second-referendum","story":"Home Secretary Sajid Javid,International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and Brexit minister James Cleverlysaid they would refuse to grant Holyrood the necessary power to hold a vote.:SNP MEP Alyn Smith threatened with legal action by Brexit PartyOther candidates to be the next Prime Minister are expected to follow suit.Ms Sturgeon hit back, saying voters would not accept being denied a vote by a Tory PM.Memo to Tory leadership candidates: A majority of Scots - independence supporters and opponents alike - will not accept being told by a Tory PM that we are not lsquoallowedrsquo to choose our own future @theSNP gov https:t.co khEIWdmvapIt followed the First Minister publishing the legislation she hopes will pave the way for a new vote on the constitution in the second half of next year.However the -page Referendums Scotland Bill only applies to issues within the current powers of the Scottish Parliament.In order to form the basis of an independence referendum it would require the transfer of extra powers from Westminster under a so-called Section  order.Ms Sturgeon has said she will ask Westminster for a Section  order in due course, buyut has been unable to say how she would get it from a reluctant government.Theresa May has already refused to grant an order, saying ldquonow is not the time.Now those vying to replace her as Prime Minister have also ruled it out.:Politics Live: Scottish independence legislation to be tabled at HolyroodMr Javid tweeted: ldquoIf I become PM, I wonrsquot allow a second Scottish independence referendum.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Kilted Chef Craig Wilson raids Oldmeldrum local Liz Millars fridge\"  Kilted Chef sets out to reduce food waste viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"glad rags and cartridge bags calling all prince charmings","story":"Scotlands premier all female shooting club, Glad Rags  Cartridge Bags is hoping to add a bit of romance to their event in June.It’s a first for the club as Mhairi Morriss owner of Jomm Events and founder of Glad Rags and Cartridge Bags explained: “I have so many wonderful ladies coming to our events, but some have not found their prince charming yet so I thought I would try and give cupid a helping hand by organising a fun evening of clay shooting and supper for all the single lads and lassies.”Mhairi stressed that it will be a fun relaxed evening with all abilities of shot very welcome from complete beginners to the more experienced.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself. It#s good to have a hobby, and I don#t find that my sport has a negative effect on the farm.#For more on this story, see next week#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In contrast, there are currently only , petrol stations - a figure that is continuing to decline.Scotland is the UK region with the greatest number of charging points, followed by London and the south-east.Yorkshire and Wales are the regions least well equipped with facilities.The network has been expanding steadily to support an increasing number of electric vehicles coming on to the road, with the number of locations increasing by  per cent in the past  months.Across Scotland there were virtually no chargers fitted five years ago, while petrol forecourts have declined by a quarter over the last decade.The Petrol Retailers Association has said one third of independent filling stations, many rural, have closed.Now plug-in points are replacing pumps in many villages.Areas without access to petrol which now have chargers include Torridon in the West Highlands and Tomintoul in Moray.Ben Lane, Zap-Map co-founder, said: “The public and private sectors are now investing heavily in the UK’s EV charging infrastructure to ensure that there are sufficient charging points to support the growing electric fleet. “This month’s milestone reveals the rapid pace of change already underway as the age of the combustion engine gives way to an all-electric era, with vehicles offering both zero-emissions and a better driving experience.”Juliet Davenport, founder and chief executive of renewable power firm Good Energy, said: “Tackling the climate crisis means electric vehicles need to go mainstream. “This milestone shows how rapidly we are moving in that direction, away from polluting petrol and diesel cars.

One of these # probably the most common question addressed to authors is: Where do you get your ideas from  Ask an author this, and you will get, in the first place, a thin smile that is actually a wince, quickly disguised as a thin smile. It is, of course, a perfectly understandable question. Do authors make things up, or are they inspired by what they have seen or heard  Or do they perhaps get them from the books of other authors  Is there a great Jungian soup of ideas somewhere in the human consciousness from which authors may select salient plots Possibly, but most authors will answer tactiturnly and pass, as quickly as possible, to the next question. Some authors,they are unduly irritated by this enquiry, will reply: “From a mail order company called Ideas Ltd”. That is a discourteous reply, and not recommended, but is sometimes tempting.The other question that occurs very commonly is: What were your favourite books as a child  Now that is an interesting question to ask anybody, author or not. And while we’re here, perhaps you might like to think about it. Can you remember Since you ask, as a small boy I had two. One was The Boy’s Book of Merchant Shipping, a small, blue-bound book that featured, in infinitely boring detail, a long list of merchant ships, along with a small line drawing of each. Tonnages were listed, as were dates of construction and normal routes. That was all. It was a book without any human characters. It was, in effect, a merchant shipping trade directory, disguised as a book for hapless boys.I loved it, and slept with it under my pillow, an attachment that brings to mind W.H. Auden’s lines: When I was a child, I Loved a pumping engine, Thought it every bit as  Beautul as you. Sometimes today I think back to it and reflect on how,I still had it, it would be ideally placed under the pillow – a sure remedy for any bout of insomnia. One might forget the usual remedies for sleeplessness and resort, instead, to a brief dip into The Boy’s Book of Merchant Shipping. How quickly would sleep overcome one as one perused the features of coastal steamers. So, these otherwise unreadable books may have their uses. I once read five pages of the Swaziland Telephone Directory, and enjoyed the experience. There were some wonderful names listed, including somebody called Charlie P. Charlie. I would have loved to have met him – or at least to have phoned him.My other favourite book as a boy was called Ginger’s Adventures. I loved that book every bit as much as my list of merchant ships. Unlike The Boy’s Book of Merchant Shipping this book was in verse, or doggerel, perhaps. Anyway, it rhymed, and had an unying metre. It tells the tale of a boy called Tommy, who had a dog called Ginger. I would have enjoyed it evenit had stopped there, but there was more. Tommy lived on a farm and wore an old-fashioned smock. Today he might have been recognised as a cross-dresser – but not in those days. His dog, Ginger, was accused – unjustly – of chasing ducks and sent off to live where. The word we now use is rehoused, but that was not available then. People were kicked out in those days, rather than rehoused.Ginger’s new home was in London. That was bad enough, but for a dog it was pretty awful. And then, to pile Pelion upon Ossa, his new owner was a girl. Today, of course, in a modern edition of this book, Tommy would be a girl anyway and Ginger would be a bitch. But in those days, they were male. Ginger did not like living in London, where he was obliged to sleep on a satin cushion. I remember looking enviously at the picture of the satin cushion. We had no satin cushions in our house. Children’s books are often slyly aspirational.Just when things are looking pretty bleak for Ginger, he decides to run away. Off he goes, and at last ends up back on the farm. There, all appears to be forgiven and he is allowed to stay with Tommy once again. The end.Now it would be possible to deconstruct this story in a trice. Ph.D. theses have been written on less fertile ground than that, but one thing is clear: Ginger’s Adventures would not make it into print today. And that leads to a serious question. Nobody would suggest that today’s boys should be subjected to such sexist messages, even subliminal ones, but a legitimate question might he asked as to whether boys’ needs are being adequately addressed. There are plenty of books that quite properly portray girls fulfilling roles that in the past were dominated by boys. These books are important. There are also books that convey to boys the message that they can take on roles that have in the past been the province of girls. There is currently a book about a boy who dreams of becoming a mermaid.But what about boys who don’t want to become mermaids  There must be some. I never wanted to be a mermaid. Never. But that was entirely to do with the problems of breathing underwater. That’s all.Somebody should write a book called It’s All Right to be a Boy. A sensitive book, mind. But perhaps the hero could dream of becoming a lumberjack. With a tartan shirt. Or a pilot. Boys would love that – and we must keep them reading.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"life re injected into edinburgh international film festival alistair harkness","story":"The programme launch of the Edinburgh International Film Festival has been a dispiriting affair in recent years, with too few films of note to get excited about and far too many unknown quantities proving they were unknown quantities for a reason.Opening with Edinburgh director Ninian Doff’s properly funny coming-of-age comedy Boyz in the Wood, however, the rd edition of the festival proves there’s le in the old dog yet.There is the UK premieres of Jim Jarmusch’s recent Cannes-opener The Dead Don’t Die, Joanna Hogg’s Sundance-winning The Souvenir and — headlining a commemorative retrospect — Varga by Agnès, the final film by the late, great Agnès Varda.

Mr Stedman-Bruce looked set to seize a seat north of the Border for Mr Farage’s party backing a ‘no-deal’ departure form the EU and it was primed for widespread gains.The SNP, which came out on top as expected with around  per cent of the early votes, saw Mr Smith and Mr Allard heading to Brussels as MEPs.Mr Smith said last night: “Scotland’s a dferent country. We’ve got a dferent view of how we see our place in the world.“We’ve got a dferent view about how we want to interact with our European continent. We voted clearly remain in the initial EU \u2028referendum and that vote has been clearly replicated with the vote which is doing well for my party.“Taking the results in the round, it’s clear that Scotland’s for Europe – we have voted Remain again. That will cannot be ignored.”Scots voted  per cent in favour of staying in the EU in the  referendum, but the weight of votes south of the Border swung the outcome in favour of Leave.The final results announced in Scotland showed the SNP winning . per cent of the votes in the European election – a total of , votes.The Brexit Party came second with , votes , the Liberal Democrats in third with , votes , the Conservatives in fourth with , votes , Labour in fth with , votesand the Scottish Greens in sixth with , votes . Change UK came seventh with , votesand Ukip were in eighth with just , votes .Mr Stedman-Bruce’s victory came at the expense of Ukip, which lost the seat it won in Scotland.There was better news for the Lib Dems, who looked on course to finish second across the UK.The outcome is likely to heap the pressure on the contenders for the Tory leadership to take a hard line and getting Brexit finalised without a deal.The Brexit Party’s victory across the UK saw it claim over  per cent of the vote while the Tories were struggling to take  per cent just days after Theresa May announced her departure as Prime Minister. The first seats declared on the night saw former Scottish Tory MSP Brian Monteith win a seat in the north-east of England for the Brexit Party, which took two seats in the region, while Labour took one seat. The Brexit Party’s  per cent share of the vote wasdouble the  per cent racked up by Labour.: Scottish Parliament’s Presiding officer on tour for anniversaryLabour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry blamed the lack of clarity about the party’s position on Brexit for its poor showing.“We went into the election where the most important issue was what was our view on leaving the European Union and we were not clear about it.“We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear and sent people out to campaign on that and unfortunately we just weren’t clear enough.”She said the party must now come out clearly in favour of a second vote on leaving the EU.The misery for the Tories continued just days after the announcement of Theresa May’sdeparture as leader, as the party was left heading for about  per cent of the vote. The omens were bad for the big two when the first results of the night came through in Leeds and saw Brexit claim victory with  per cent of the vote. Labour slumped to  per centwhile the Tory vote was down by  per cent. Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson tweeted a link to hisarticle, adding: “The message from last night’s results is clear. It is time for us to deliver Brexit and set out our positive plans for the country.”Other results in ares like Sedgmoor in Somerset and Newcastle in the north-east saw big wins for the Brexit Party. Turnout was up considerably north of the border by  per cent in some places, despite a lacklustre campaign, suggesting that Scots have been prompted to turnout by the recent Brexit turmoil. Edinburgh recorded a . per cent turnout, an increase from . per cent in the  vote.It was a similar picture across the EU, where the traditional parties had a bad night, while the far right enjoyed a surge in support. The Greens also fared well. In France, president Emmanuel Macron looked poised to suffer defeat to Marine Le Pen of the National Front.Seventy-three MEPs will be elected to represent the UK, but they may only be in office for six months with the UK still poised to leave the EU in November.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

They also said they hope the Scarva Street congregation will be able to move forward together.The comments came after Rev Andrew Watson was removed from his post at Scarva Street Presbyterian Church after the congregation said they no longer had any confidence in the minister.Earlier this year he was ly accused of having an “improper relationship” with another woman.Following an internal investigation, it was revealed that the accusations were unsubstantiated. However, despite having his name cleared, Rev Watson has still been removed from the post he has held for the last twelve years after the congregation committee passed a vote of no confidence.Rev Watson, who has also served as the Moderator of the Iveagh Presbytery, was removed from his position in the church last Monday, even though he was cleared of immoral conduct earlier this year.The internal investigation was launched in April when Rev Watson, who is married with five children, became the centre of malicious rumours in the town. Rev Watson was accused of having an affair with a woman who said she was going through a orce at the time. She denied there was anyone  involved in her orce.The Judicial Commission of the Presbyterian Church found “no evidence” of the alleged misconduct and it was reported that a number of the church elders had “contributed” to spreading the rumours. Two members of Scarva Street Presbyterian Church have since been disciplined for their involvement. An elder was removed from his position and the Clerk of Session was also removed from his post, although he remains as an elder in the church.Rev Watson, who moved to Scarva Street Presbyterian from Donegal in , is said to be “devastated” by the decision. The Presbyterian Church have yet to find a replacement for Scarva Street Presbyterian and it is understood that Rev Watson has not yet found a new position.A spokesperson for the Presbyterian Church said that Rev Watson was “a minister of good standing with the Presbyterian Church. I would hope Andrew will find another congregation and have a flourishing ministry.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours. The young ones are putting their mark on the garden, which is great.”Michael McAllister from Leonard Cheshire Disability commented: “It’s good to get the guys involved in this project.“This is the third day we’ve been here and we’re getting ready for the barbecue next week. It’s been good fun, but it’s a good opportunity for the young people to get involved with Rosemount House.“It’s a good education for them. It’s also about creating more awareness in Belfast about homelessness. This is a real positive project for the young people to be involved in.”Michael Bradley, who lectures at Belfast Met, said: “Partnering up with Leonard Cheshire gives young people the chance to give back to the community. They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here.

It’s like getting a record out again, all you have to do is just dust it down a bit.”Terry stressed that their Harmony Live performance, along with Irish duo Aslan and The  Of Us, definitely won’t be their last following speculation that circulated at the start of .“We didn’t say anything about final shows, I’ve actually discovered how this happened and it’s usually the venue or the agent who come out with the story.

Even when you deny it, it appears in the papers as well, but it’s not the case,” he said.Terry spoke of how nowadays outdoor festival gigs are planned to within an inch of their le – unlike back in the ’s.“Back in the day the first thing you did when you arrived at an open air thing, was the itinerary would be on the door, first thing you’d do is take it down as it had no resemblance to reality because everything then would run half an hour, to an hour late.”With the Spice Girls set to appear at Croke Park this weekend, Elton John taking two years to complete his ‘farewell’ tour and a Let’s Rock ’s festival set to set out its stall this summer in Boucher Road, Terry spoke of how nostalgia is a “new aspect” of the rock ‘n’ roll industry.“There is a big nostalgia industry, people who might have bought a record of ours when they were teenagers are now in their ’s. People want to go out and see what they spent their money on in their youths. Nostalgia is not part of the rock ‘n’ roll business, it’s a new aspect. Now rock ‘n’ roll is old enough to be nostalgic.

The couple has moved there after the loss of the family home, Belle Reve, to creditors. Stanley’s suppressed rage at his lot in le finds an outlet when Blanche turns up.Through “nips of whiskey”, “sips of Bourbon” and card games, Blanche’s dreamy posturing and posingcollides head-on with Stanley’s rage and the anger boils over as the play reaches its brutal, violent climax.The production is spot on in its timing, debuting as the fall-out from the#MeToo campaign around the abuse of women continues to gather pace. Key contemporary issues of PTSD, mental health and gender equality are brought into sharp and devastating focus and we are forced to confront the question of how much –anything – has changed in  years.Emma Jordan’s sure-footed direction, Ciaran Bagnall’s atmospheric set and lighting design, Enda Kenny’s exquisite costume design and Carl Kennedy’s sound design interweave to bring us an utterly convincing sense of place and mood and combine with an absolutely outstanding cast to make this production the best I have ever seen at the Lyric.The audience were on their feet at the end to gave a well-deserved standing ovation to all involved in a play that will stay with you for a long time to come.A must-see.

Mr Hunt, one of  MPs vying to be the next prime minister, said a failure to solve Brexit could ruin the Conservatives and warned the \"biggest risk\" to delivering on the referendum was a general election. His comments came as Housing Minister Kit Malthouse became the latest person to enter the race to succeed Theresa May, saying there was a \"hunger for someone new\". Mrs May, attending a summit in Brussels, said the European election results in which the Tories took just % of the vote were \"deeply disappointing\". \"I think what it shows is the importance of actually delivering on Brexit. I think the best way to do that is with a deal,\" she said. \"But it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward and get a consensus.\" The comments are aimed at Brexiteers in the race to replace her who have said they are prepared to back a no-deal departure from the EU, something which could lead to a clash with Parliament. Mr Hunt warned rivals that calling a general election - potentially to win a mandate for a no-deal Brexit - could be a disaster for the Tories.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"We must not go back to the electorate asking for their mandate until weve delivered what we promised we would do last time, which is to deliver Brexit, it would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.\" Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum but has adopted an increasingly Eurosceptic tone, said he had \"always believed we should keep no deal on the table\" as it is the \"best way of getting a good deal\". He said it was important to \"find a dferent way to get a deal\", adding \"we have to have a go at this\" as he proposed forming a new wider negotiating team to change the Withdrawal Agreement. Leadership rival Dominic Raab also said he was focused on \"getting a fairer deal from the EU as we leave\". But outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed \"there will be no renegotiation\". The agreement between the EU and Mrs May to delay Brexit until October  included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal. Meanwhile, Mr Malthouse, who brought together Tory Leavers, the DUP and Remainers behind a compromise Brexit plan earlier this year, said he had a \"good number\" of MPs backing his bid. \"Weve got to find a way to unite the Conservative Party to deliver a Brexit plan so we can move onto a really compelling, attractive domestic agenda that might command victory at a general election,\" he said. \"One of the reasons that Im running is that Im the only person who has actually done that.\"Other candidates for the top job also started to offer a flavour of their policies should they win a ballot of Conservative Party members later this year. Michael Gove is prepared to offer free UK citizenship to three million nationals who resided in the UK at the time of the June  referendum. Matt Hancock wrote in the Daily Mail about \"driving up the living wage and cutting taxes\". In response to Mr Hunts warning that a no-deal Brexit election would be \"political suicide\", leadership rival Esther McVey responded: \"Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on October .\" Others vying for the top job include Cabinet colleagues Sajid Javid, Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart, and current bookies favourite Boris Johnson. Meanwhile, Downing Street indicated the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may never be published."},{"url":null,"title":"safety at core of translink business st macnissis little reporters learn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon why we should celebrate northern ireland having three female meps","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it comes to grasping at straws, that surely takes some beating.Its hard to argue that Alliance has bagged top boasting rights. Naomi Long more than doubled the Alliance vote, attracting , extra first preferences than Anna Lo did when she stood for the party back in , and the party has become the first to describe itself neither as unionist nor nationalist to take a European Parliament seat for the constituency.Some people will deny that last part. There are always conspiracy theorists on the farther edges of either political tradition who claim to know what Alliance \"really\" stands for.It also remains to be seen whether the results represent a permanent sht away from sectarian politics or just a recalibration of the centre. Another low turn out suggests voters here dont give EU elections that high a priority, even after three years of scare stories about the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The Remain vote only went up fractionally on the  referendum.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetWhats definitely historic is that the three MEPs sent to represent Northern Ireland in Brussels are all women, a detail which, to be honest, I hadnt even noticed until it was pointed out to me. That makes two things worth celebrating. The first is the increasing prominence of female representatives in a society which has been male-dominated for too long. The second is that their presence has become so familiar that its becoming possible to not even pay close attention to their gender.Some might wonder whether the female politicians in Northern Ireland are that much of an improvement on the men. The current impasse at Stormont has been presided over by the DUPs Arlene Foster, Sinn Feins Michelle ONeill and a female Secretary of State after all.That is to miss the point - and those who champion the entry of more women into politics often miss it most spectacularly.Alexandra De La Torre is coordinator of the womens peace project the Next Chapter. Last month she said that the real question to ask about the growing number of female politicians in Northern Ireland is: \"Are they representing all women  Or are they representing the male-oriented politics of their political parties \"With respect, that isnt the \"real\" question at all. Its not womens job to clean up the political sphere, any more than its their job to clean the house. It doesnt matterwomen make anything better. Women have every right to be as useless at politics as the men who came before them.What matters is that theyre there at all, which is why every woman who wins an election represents another small victory, not least in Northern Ireland, where, those totemic leadership roles aside, theyre still in a minority politically.There is something to be said for the argument that having female leaders masks the fact that women still dont have a strong enough voice, but part of the problem is the belief that women have \"a voice\" when the truth is they have lots of voices. Too often women in public le are told that they must say and believe certain things in order to earn respect, especially from other women who call themselves feminists, but whose feminism mainly seems to consist of telling other women what to think and haranguing them when they refuse. Feminists who still think the \"wrong\" sort of women are winning elections are just as guilty of doing down women as the misogynists who think the corridors of power are no place for a woman.Whats refreshing is that the three women who now speak for Northern Ireland at EU level are standing there on their own merits and on the s of their respective parties, rather than playing the \"female card\". They each see their role, rightly, as to represent everyone in Northern Ireland.That theyre all so dferent, in character and background and attitude, is noteworthy too. Diane Dodds was a teacher Naomi Long, an engineer Martina Anderson... well, lets just say she was out of the job market for a long time.When it comes to Brexit and the Union and other issues, their views span the whole spectrum of opinion. To give one example, Diane Dodds is opposed to any attempt to dilute the law on abortion Naomi Long believes that terminations should be decriminalised and made available in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality, but does not support extending the  Abortion Act fully to Northern Ireland Sinn Fein wants abortion liberalised immediately along the lines of the Republic. That seems broadly representative of views across Northern Ireland.There are other dferences too. Diane Dodds is from a rural background the other two grew up in the city, one in Belfast, one in Derry. Anderson is also the only one of the three to have blown up a furniture store in her teenage years, whilst Naomi Long found minor fame as a schoolgirl by appearing on the quiz show Blockbusters. Readers must decide for themselves which was the more admirable adolescent pastime.The important thing is that they are all distinct politically in ways that have little to do with their gender.As it happens, theyre unlikely to get a chance to take up their seats in the European Parliament anyway. The Tories have been so spooked by the rise of the Brexit Party that the new prime minister will feel bound to get the country out of the EU by the October  deadline rather than face another general election. All three seats were filled by women here for the first time, but it was probably also the last time. Just let no one say that the achievement is any less symbolic for that."},{"url":null,"title":"meps to earn 30000 plus expenses for four months work if brexit happens","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added:

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny, pledged to give judgment on the appeal as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Recycling survey reveals trend in local

authority had asked them to recycle.The survey mdash carried out by polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk mdash revealed that only % of those surveyed would recycle when it was convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling, including glass mdash a service that until last month was unavailable in the former Down Council area.In addition, the survey showed that where the council area could lsquocomminglersquo glass in the same bin with the rest of their household recyclables mdash plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard etc mdash householders were on average % happy with their glass collection method, compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more local authorities are seeing the benefits and cost savings achieved by switching to commingling collection services, alongside an ultra-modern Materials Recycling Facilitylike ours that receives, separates and prepares recyclables for productive use where.The Lucid Talk survey was carried out across all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district council

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

The Consortium, which is hosted by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, is comprised of the  councils outside of Belfast. The Consortium will implement an exciting new collaborative programme to drive greater investment in fibre and digital infrastructure across the region.Together the Consortium developed a Northern Ireland bid for £m of LFFN funding from DCMS. This substantial funding award will be used to deliver full fibre to approximately  public sector sites, under the Public-Sector Anchor Tenancy model, by March . The project will enable Councils to signicantly develop their ability to deliver services and improve access for communities and residents. It is hoped that this will be the first of many such investments over the next few years.Minister for Digital Margot James said: “We’re building a Britain that’s fit for the future, and our plans for a national full fibre broadband network underpin our modern Industrial Strategy. This £ million boost for gigabit speeds in Northern Ireland will benefit homes and businesses across the country and I congratulate the Full Fibre Northern Ireland Consortium in its successful bid.”Currently only % of premises in Northern Ireland have access to full fibre connectivity and outside of the major conurbations the figure is much lower. With responsibility for promoting economic development, and local knowledge, the councils within the FFNI Consortium are well positioned to drive fibre infrastructure in areas where it is most needed.Through the FFNI programme the Consortium will therefore help to expand the fibre footprint across the region to ensure Northern Ireland has available and affordable connectivity to support future growth and prosperity.Open letter demands government action on Irish language Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. motorist crashes car with R plates through clothes shop windowN.I. set to sizzle in long summer of intense heat -

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Glackin blamed UK leader Jeremy Corbynrsquos ldquotin eared approach on Brexit for the partyrsquos woes, saying that while Labour had tried to appease Leave voters south of the border, this policy had cost votes in Scotland.Writing in the Daily Record newspaper Mr Glackin said: ldquoIf I could pull the plug out of theLabour Partyand restart it I would.ldquoWe are essentially on le support at the moment and facing a terminal decline in Scotland.In the wake of the European election result, Mr Leonard said he ldquohoped Scottish Labour would back a second Brexit referendum in all circumstances, and would campaign for remain.This policy sht is to be voted on when Labourrsquos Scottish executive committee meets on June .But Mr Glackin saidwhile Labour had been in ldquobad situations before ndash including when the party lost all but one of its Scottish MPs in the  general election ndash things were now ldquomuch worse. --Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonardwith Jeremy Corbyn  --He described the results of the European election as ldquocataclysmic, and added: ldquoJeremy Corbyn and his inner circle have been tin-eared when it comes to Scotland.ldquoA substantial majority of Labour voters in Scotland, as where in the UK, were Remain voters.

That side was obviously Remain.He also hit out at Mr Leonard saying while his predecessor Kezia Dugdale had won more autonomy from London for Scottish Labour, Mr Leonard had shown a ldquomystying reluctance to use this..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Scottish Labour on  ule support u after  ucataclysmic u Euro election results article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
