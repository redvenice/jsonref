Video: Reuters  Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron will go into the April 24th presidential election runoff, according to projections following Sunday’s vote.  Photographs: Joel Saget and Eric FeferbergAFP via Getty ImagesPresident Emmanuel Macron will confront the extreme right-wing leader Marine Le Pen in the runoff of the French presidential election on April 24th, after ten other candidates were eliminated in the first round of voting on Sunday.Mr Macron defeated Ms Le Pen five years ago. The Ifop-Fiducial polling institute on Sunday night predicted he will defeat her again, by a much narrower margin of 51 to 49 per cent. That prediction is within the margin of error, meaning Le Pen has a chance of winning. Mr Macron defeated Ms Le Pen by 66 to 34 per cent in 2017.Mr Macron won an estimated 28.3 per cent of the first-round vote, five points higher than Ms Le Pen at 23.3 per cent.There was palpable relief among Mr Macron’s supporters, because the last opinion polls on Friday had placed Ms Le Pen only one or two percentage points behind him.Four other candidates immediately called on their supporters to vote for Mr Macron in the runoff and the extreme left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who came in third with an estimated 21.2 per cent of the vote exhorted his supporters: “Do not give a single vote to Madame Le Pen!”. Mr Mélenchon could make a big difference by asking his supporters to vote for Macron.“I solemnly invite our compatriots, whatever their choice in the first round, to join us,” Mr Macron continued. “Some will do so to bar the way for the extreme right. I am fully aware that does not mean they support my programme, and I respect that. I know that is the choice of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. I salute their clarity towards the extreme right... I want to hold out a hand to all those who want to work for France. ”Ms Le Pen made a similar appeal, inviting all those who did not vote for Mr Macron to join her. The leader of the Rassemblement National said the runoff presents France with “a fundamental choice between opposing visions” with on one side “ision, injustice and disorder” which she said were embodied by Mr Macron, and “social justice” if she is elected.Eric Zemmour, also from the extreme right, came in fourth, at around 7 per cent. He was alone in calling on his supporters to give their second-round vote to Le Pen. He said that the party he recently founded, Reconquête! (Reconquest!) “will not give up until France is reconquered”.Ms Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal, who abandoned her aunt to join Mr Zemmour’s campaign, said it was up to Ms Le Pen to “hold out her hand” to Mr Zemmour “so that Emmanuel Macron will not be re-elected”.Sunday’s results showed how successful Mr Macron has been at destroying the traditional left and right-wing parties, the Socialists and Les Républicains, but how badly he has failed to blunt the appeal of the extremes. Of the top four candidates, only Mr Macron is not considered an extremist. Three extreme right-wing candidates and Mr Mélenchon from the far left won a combined score of about 53 per cent.None of the other candidates was certain to reach the 5 per cent threshold required to have their campaign expenses reimbursed.By winning more than 20 per cent of the vote, Mr Mélenchon, a former Socialist, is positioned to lead the remnants of the French left in the legislative elections which follow in June.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"perilous moment conservative party","story":"And we have the ongoing police investigation into whether Boris Johnson himself broke lockdown rules by attending events in his flat and the offices within Number Ten. Here there is already a concerted attempt by loyalists to downplay the significance of the moment should the Prime Minister be fined by the police. Their job has been made easier by the strength Johnson has shown in arming Ukraine and standing up to Russia. They are aided too by the sense that Sunak’s recent difficulties mean he is less likely, for now at least, to win the race to succeed Johnson. And they will use Sunak’s example as a warning against taking a chance on other less experienced candidates.Regardless of their good fortune, however, the loyalists’ arguments will not wash. It is not sustainable, for example, for Downing Street to keep the names of senior staffers or officials secret after they have been fined. Nor is it sustainable for fines issued in relation to events in the Downing Street flat to be kept secret. Nor can the Prime Minister or his spokesmen get away with refusing to accept that it will be established, if he is issued with a fine he accepts and pays, that he has broken the law.However much the loyalists may wish to convince themselves otherwise, the idea that a prime minister should survive a process that finds him guilty not only of breaking the law, but breaking extraordinary laws he imposed and implored the public to respect, is simply absurd. So too is the idea that he should survive after denying breaking those laws and issuing emphatic denials in Parliament.The Conservative Party might be capable of deluding itself thus, but if it does the public will draw very different conclusions. They will see a Government – already struggling with inflation and finding it difficult to get things done – closing ranks and showing appalling double standards.This is dangerous enough for the Tories, but if part of the strategy to prop up the Prime Minister is to limit and discredit potential successors, there follow two more problems. Keeping tall poppies away from high office will mean the quality of day-to-day government will continue to suffer. And it will risk a crisis of leadership following the Johnson premiership, whenever it ends, as the choices are narrowed unnecessarily. It is ridiculous that the likes of Tom Tugendhat and Jeremy Hunt remain on the backbenches, and ridiculous that some in Downing Street see only advantage in Sunak’s recent difficulties.With notable exceptions – such as Nadhim Zahawi’s vaccine rollout, Ben Wallace’s work arming the Ukrainians, and Priti Patel’s forthcoming plans to establish offshore processing for asylum claims – much of what the Government is doing is piecemeal, technocratic and often contradictory. The Tories want to intervene in the economy, but have junked their industrial strategy. They say they want lower taxes, but keep putting them up. They promise to level-up the country, but while Michael Gove has the ideas, he lacks the spending power for them to make a difference quickly enough.As with the questions of ethical standards in government, this lack of coherence can be explained in part by the Prime Minister’s style of leadership. Johnson has deliberately formed a third eleven cabinet, to avoid creating powerful rivals. He has set lofty targets, but neither formed detailed plans to achieve them, nor empowered ministers to do so. He has appointed a chancellor with whom he was always going to clash thanks to their contrasting methods of working and starkly different views of fiscal policy.Tired governments, made complacent by years in office, come to believe that their position of power will last forever. They lose sight of the bigger picture, drift into technocratic decision-making, and their fights with one another grow more important than those with opposing parties and vested interests.Unfortunately, this government now suffers all these ills.So now seems a good time for Conservatives to remind themselves of the binary nature of power in our parliamentary democracy. You either hold power, or you do not. You can change the country, or you can watch the other side change it in ways you dislike.More from NewsChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov warns Russia will \u0026#39take Kyiv\u0026#39 in new offensiveRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia could use phosphorus munitions to seize Mariupol, warns MoDPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak has been \u0026#39very candid\u0026#39 about tax, insistsWhy this French presidential election heralds the demise of traditional politicsLocal Elections 2022: What is up for election, where, and how to votePink Moon 2022: when it peaks in the UK and other full moon datesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"easter holidaymakers urged travel night country braced busiest","story":"Easter holidaymakers have been urged to travel at night to avoid road chaos as travel woes are set to worsen.An estimated 21.5 million leisure trips will be made between Good Friday and Easter Monday, making it the busiest weekend on Britain’s roads in at least eight years, according to the RAC.As families seek to avoid chaos on the railway network, with 2,500 train routes due to be delayed or cancelled, and in airports, where Covid staff shortages continue to cause disruption, more are expected to travel by car for the first bank holiday in two years with no legal restrictions.Long delays are also expected to continue on roads in Kent because of a shortage of cross-Channel sailings caused by the suspension of operations by P\u0026ampO Ferries after it sacked nearly 800 workers.The RAC, which began tracking motorists\u0027 Easter plans in 2014, has urged drivers wishing to avoid congestion this weekend to set off before 9am or delay their journeys until after 7:30pm.Around 2,000 roadworks will be in place over the Easter weekend, and the busiest single day on the roads is expected to be Good Friday.In addition to increased congestion, motorists also face the most expensive Easter on record when it comes to fuel prices.Latest government figures show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on April 4 was 161.9p, with diesel at 176.0p.Likely congestion spots will include the M25 clockwise from Junction 8 (Reigate Hill Interchange, Surrey) to Junction 16 (Denham Interchange, Buckinghamshire), the M6 north between Greater Manchester and the Lake District, and near Stonehenge, Wiltshire.Meanwhile, several airlines and airports are struggling to cope with staff sickness and shortages, prompting thousands of flights to be cancelled by easyJet and British Airways in recent weeks.Manchester Airport is warning departing passengers to expect delays of up to 90 minutes, whilst rail passengers are being warned of delays as Network Rail carries out 530 engineering projects costing a total of £83 million.The West Coast Main Line will be closed between London Euston and Milton Keynes between Good Friday and Easter Monday because of upgrades of the existing line and HS2 work.This will affect football supporters as Liverpool and Manchester City meet in an FA Cup semi-final match at Wembley on Saturday.Rod Dennis, an RAC traffic spokesman, said: After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads, our research suggests a return to traffic levels that are much more typical of this time of year.It\u0027s very possible this weekend could turn out to be one of the busiest for leisure journeys for many years.Add in the impact of disruption on the rail network and one of the biggest fixtures of the sporting calendar taking place this weekend, and you have all the ingredients needed for problems on the roads.Traffic volumes will likely be even higher if some warm spring sunshine makes an appearance.Mr Dennis urged drivers to make sure vehicles are prepared for getaway trips.This is even more important for anyone travelling longer distances than they have for several months, he said.A breakdown is much less likely if a car\u0027s oil and coolant levels, as well as tyre pressure and tread depth, have all been checked before setting out.A Network Rail spokesperson said: 2,500 train services over the four-day Easter weekend will be affected by works. Some will be running on alternative or shorter routes with buses.Over 95 per cent of our network is open for business but works will affect some routes.

The under-fire Chancellor tonight took the dramatic step of referring himself to Boris Johnsonaposs independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, following a growing row over his familyaposs financial arrangements. It comes hours after he had ordered a Whitehall inquiry into how his weaposs tax arrangements were leaked to the media. Mr Sunakaposs political future hangs by a thread as he faces fresh calls to come clean over his tax affairs and US immigration status. The Tory minister tried to claim his we Akshata Murty was the victim of a smear campaign, after it emerged she held non-domiciled tax status, which allows people to avoid paying UK tax on overseas income.  The Chancellor, whose Spring Statement last month failed to help struggling families cope with the UKaposs biggest fall in living standards since the time of rationing, was reportedly weighing up whether to quit after a string of damaging stories. His team has previously argued all declarations to the register of ministerial interests were above board. In a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday evening, Mr Sunak said: “I have always followed the rules and I hope such a review will provide further clarity.” In a letter to Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak said his “overriding concern” was to maintain public confidence.  “My overriding concern is that the public retain confidence in the answers that are given and I believe the best way of achieving this is to ensure those answers are entirely independent, without bias or favour,” he said. “To that end I would recommend that Lord Geidt makes all his conclusions public. “I am confident that such a review of my declarations will find all relevant information was appropriately declared. “I have throughout my ministerial career followed the advice of officials regarding matters or propriety and disclosure and will continue to do so.”  The White House has been urged to investigate after Mr Sunak admitted holding a US green card until October  - while he was the Chancellor.Mr Sunak has been hit with reports that he is listed as a beneficiary of tax haven trusts in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, despite pledging to close tax loopholes. Meanwhile, Infosys, an Indian firm founded by his weaposs billionaire father, where Ms Murty holds £m of shares in, is urgently reviewing its base in Moscow. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a matter of “basic fairness” that the Chancellor’s family should pay tax in the same way as everyone . “I don’t think the Chancellor gets that. That raises real questions about his judgment,” she told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.  Policing Minister Kit Malthouse admitted Ms Murtyaposs status as a non-dom - something she gave up last week amid public fury - was “not ideal”, but nonetheless rushed to defend Mr Sunak from colleagues who declared the Chancelloraposs career to be toast. He said the Chancellor was a “smart, clever, committed politician” who had helped steer the economy through the worst of the pandemic. Ms Murty, who is an Indian citizen, dramatically announced on Friday that she would now pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her tax status to be a distraction. It has been estimated that her non-dom status could have saved her £ million in taxes on idends on her shares. Mr Malthouse admitted it was “not a brilliant time” for the details to come out when the country was struggling with a cost of living crisis. “Rishi Sunak has been a remarkable force for good in this country over the last two years, he said.“He put in place some incredible support schemes during the pandemic at enormous speed. “It is not ideal, but we all when we sign up for this job know that there is going to be rough times and smooth times,” he added. Meanwhile sources close to Mr Sunak have played down reports that he was moving his we and two daughters out of Downing Street to escape the glare of the media. The Sunday Mirror published pictures of removal vans arriving in the street on Saturday to take their belongings away. One source said however they had always intended to spend more time in their west London home as their elder daughter, Krishna, entered her final term of primary school before moving on to secondary school. Mr Sunak is still expected to stay in Downing Street during the week while joining them at weekends. Labouraposs Angela Rayner said: “The chaos caused by the Conservatives over the last week must be brought to an end. “A fish rots from the head. It is the Prime Minister’s responsibility to bring this debacle to a close by ensuring that standards are upheld across his Cabinet. When it comes to the Tories hiking up taxes on working people, it seems it is one rule for them and another for the rest of us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Breaking NewsRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fishy Rishi is a beached Chancellor without credibility, struggling to survive and contemplating resignation over the Rishi Notax scandal. The nets trawling the sordid financial affairs of his incredibly wealthy family may yet produce another jaw-dropper that will force the Tory moneybags to resign in disgrace. And the morally corrupt Prime Minister he’s now unlikely ever to succeed – charlatan Boris Johnson, who presided over widespread law-breaking during Covid, his head on the chopping block until Putin spared him – remains a rotten man. Downing Street’s decaying neighbours represent a Conservative government decomposing rapidly, with ministers mocked for regurgitating on the airwaves pathetic excuses for indefensible behaviour.  Draw a Venn diagram and the fools spouting drivel to shield slippery Sunak and an heiress we, Akshata Murty, who’d pay £, to avoid millions of pounds in British tax, overlap with idiots who ly claimed Johnson didn’t hold parties and is innocent of all charges. Whether what non-dom Murty and Green Card Sunak did was legal misses the point that it is unacceptable for a Chancellor to put up taxes for the little people while his family lawfully dodge them. Sleaze taking the Tories back to the John Major era is a glorious opportunity for Labour – and a challenge. Leader Keir Starmer is receiving conflicting advice. Either he sticks with Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals to end the non-dom scam, or he listens to those who say it would be seen as anti-business. Championing fairness could draw a thick red line between Labour and the Tories at the election. The Conservative fish is rotting... Labour needs to use its head.

NEU Joint General Secretary Dr Mary Bousted said teachers had among the highest number of unpaid working hours, saying: This is simply unsustainable and can only lead to burn-out. “The government would do well to not just accept that high workload is a problem, but that they have played a starring role in many of the contributing factors. Dr Bousted went on: The Department for Education must take steps to right the ship, which is currently shedding too many staff and not finding enough to replace them. This is to a very large extent because the job is made unattractive and unsustainable. Labour warned that Tory cuts and the chaotic handling of childrenaposs education during the pandemic had made le a misery for schools. Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan said: A decade of Conservative government and their botched handling of the pandemic is driving teachers out of our schools. Unsustainable workloads, doubling up on roles to plug staffing gaps, soaring stress levels, these are not conditions that will deliver the world class education our children deserve. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We recognise the pressure that staff in schools and colleges have been under and are enormously grateful to them for their efforts, resilience, and service now and throughout the COVID- pandemic.

On the international stage, Mr Johnson has shown Britain to be Ukraine’s staunchest ally, committed to Ukrainian independence and standing by the Ukrainian people in their hour of need. But that story is disturbingly dferent closer to home. What Ukrainian people fleeing war need most is sanctuary, and , big-hearted British families are ready to open their homes to provide it. Yet only , Ukrainian refugees have arrived here so far under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  That is because Priti Patel is not issuing them with visas quickly enough. The Home Secretary promised Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko she would ensure visas were processed in three days. That was three weeks ago. Ms Vasylenko is an impressive MP. And she is not impressed by Ms Patel’s dilly-dallying. In Kyiv today, Mr Johnson showed President Zelensky the firm hand of friendship. Now the PM needs to take a firm hand with Ms Patel – and tell her thatshe cannot sort out this mess, he will find someone who can.  Grant us a plan There was something depressingly inevitable about Brits who’d been looking forward to their first proper holiday for years spending much of it stuck in traffic jams and airport lounges. Today, chaos reigned on the ground and in the air as people tried to get away for a much-needed Easter break. The port of Dover blamed its delays on the suspension of PO Ferries. Airports said they were plagued by Covid staff absences. And Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrung his hands and expressed concern, which was about as much use as a flat tyre on the M. PO bosses are to blame for some of this by their summary sacking of  seafarers. We must spare a thought for them and their families. But Mr Shapps knew PO would present a problem this weekend. And Covid should have come as no surprise to him. Labour says better planning could have alleviated some of these delays. And when it comes to travel, Mr Shapps is planner-in-chief.

And he got the snap he wanted. A handshake and grin before getting back on the plane. Job done. Kind of. After all, that’s the optics sorted, PM, now it’s time for action. During his brief stay Mr Johnson pledged, as is his wont, everything that Ukraine needs to survive as a sovereign nation. And he’s promised missiles, rockets, armoured vehicles and new anti-ship weapons systems. That’s a start – these weapons are much needed. They are up against one of the world’s largest and most ruthless armies.  But the battlefield is not the only place where the PM needs to deliver. He also promised visas. He promised that the UK would make the process as easy as possible for desperate refugees. That’s a promise he’s failed to deliver. More accurately, his Home Secretary has failed. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP who took up arms against the Russians, said she was promised visas in three days by Priti Patel – three weeks ago. We’re used to this Government breaking promises. But to renege on a deal made to such desperate people is unforgivable. The joke in the Ukraine is that the visas will land when the war is over. Dark humour but frighteningly close to the bone.

A red velvet armchair, a shelving unit and several bags and boxes were loaded onto two trucks, which arrived at Downing Street’s back gate early on Saturday morning. But the Sunday Mirror understands the move was planned before Mr Sunak’s popularity noseed this week. The family are making the move because their eldest daughter is about to go into her final term of primary school, the Mirror understands. They want to be nearer to her school for the last few months before she goes to boarding school.  Mr Sunak is expected to split his evenings between the Downing Street flat and their Kensington home, but continue to work from Number .Previously a shoe-in to replace Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister, Mr Sunak’s fortunes have been on the wane since last month’s disastrous Spring Statement failed to provide help for families facing a cost of living crisis. This week it was revealed Mrs Murthy enjoyed non-dom tax status - and Mr Sunak had held on to his Green Card as a ‘resident’ of the United Sates for more than a year after becoming Chancellor. It comes amid calls for partners and spouses of ministers to be banned from being non-doms - and avoiding paying tax on money made outside the UK. Labour said Mr Sunak and his family potentially saved tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his weaposs non-dom status. And Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh blasted the chancellor for not being transparent about his family’s tax status. “He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate, she said. Mrs Murty announced on Friday that she would voluntarily pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her financial arrangements to be a distraction for her husband.

But ft in Alison, of Dreghorn, near Irvine, Scotland, made a dramatic breakthrough in January  when she joined WW and lost st lb, saying: “I was determined to lose weight and keep it off this time. I was fed up being the fat mum, fat we and fat friend and wanted to make myself feel better. “Due to my MS, I was struggling with a lot of basic everyday tasks, so losing weight was one way I knew I could help myself.But, because of my health and being unable to do strenuous exercise, most of my weight loss had to be down to what I ate.”Allison, whose illness means she cannot work, had a body mass index , used to gauge a healthy weight, of ., compared to the NHS healthy range of . to . when she signed up to the slimming club, making her obese.Now a healthy st lb, with a BMI of . and a slim size  , she was delighted when in August , Alasdair decided to join her and lost st in just six months.

I was so embarrassed and never really stuck to the plan.  “Over the years I’ve probably been to every slimming club there is. I’ve always lost a bit of weight then went straight back again to my normal eating habits and put it all back on.” When she finally joined WW, she had hit rock bottom with her weight, saying it was really influencing her moods and damaging her self-confidence. Also, while there were days when she felt fit and healthy, on others her MS meant she could not get out of bed and being big only increased her battered self esteem and poor body image, which made feeling fat even harder to bear. She explained: “I realised thatI carried on going the way I was that I’d have a heart attack and never see our wee boy grow up. I just wanted to be healthier.” Allison threw herself into the plan, buying books with new healthy recipes and cooking herself meals from scratch full of vegetables. While her weight loss was slow, because she could not combine diet with rigorous exercise because of her MS, she never once gained weight in more than three years on the plan.

Evenyou’re disabled, please don’t think you can’t.” Inspired by his we’s success and following an embarrassing incident at a funfair, Alasdair joined WW last summer. He said: “Last summer I was at the fair with Jacob and got marched off a ride for being too big. It was so embarrassing. “Exactly a week later, I joined Allison at my first WW meeting. I decided something had to change.” Despite being stick thin as a young man, by the time he joined WW, years of unhealthy eating, washed down with calorie-laden booze, had taken its toll on Alasdair, who wore a in waist size and whose BMI was ., making him obese. He said: “I’d seen how well Allison had done, but I was still a bit apprehensive about going on a diet at first, as I thought I would struggle cutting my portion sizes down, stopping drinking and all that.” But, losing a whopping .lb in his first week spurred Alasdair on to keep it up. And soon he was even sitting through meetings on topics such as eating more throughout your period. Sticking with the plan, he cut out alcohol, fizzy drinks, takeaways and started the couch to k app. With husband and we both using the WW app to track and scan their foods, they now enjoy a breakfast of porridge or muesli, lunches of homemade soups and salads and dinners of pasta or risotto cooked from scratch. Alasdair, now a in waist, runs k three times a week and has taken up cycling. In just  weeks, he reached his goal weight of st lb, making his BMI a healthy .. Between them the couple have lost an astonishing st lb and are both maintaining their weight, while still attending weekly WW meetings. Alasdair thanks his we for his success, saying: “Without Allison, I absolutely could not have done it. I’d have given up. She was the one who showed me the ins and outs and reassured me. She was always there to remind me how much I had to lose when I wanted to give in.” Their diet before Breakfast – Cooked breakfast, cereal or filled rolls Lunch – Toastie Dinner – Takeaway or homemade meal such as donner pizza and cheesy chips with curry Snacks – Crisps Diet now Breakfast – Porridge or muesli or brown toast Lunch – Homemade soups or salads, fruit and a yoghurt Dinner – Sausage bake, port tagliatelle or risotto.

But the Queenaposs relatives who are further down the line of succession donapost have this privilege, which means they have to use a normal surname like the rest of us. So while Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis use their parentsapos aposCambridgeapos title as their surname at school, their cousins Archie and Lilibet use the royal familyaposs aposofficialapos last name - Mountbatten-Windsor. The moniker combines the royal name, Windsor, with Prince Philipaposs surname, Mountbatten. However the name caused a massive row in the royal family and was even raised in the Houses of Parliament, resulting in a rt between the Queen and her husband.  It didnapost appear on an official document until , but the complicated story behind the name dates all the way back to .Before marrying The Queen and becoming the Duke of Edinburgh, Philipaposs official title was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.However, his name wasnapost considered to be neutral enough so he adopted the name Mountbatten after his grandparents. When the then Princess Elizabeth had the coupleaposs first child, Prince Charles, in , he assumed, due to tradition, that their little one would take his name.  However, when Elizabeth went on to become Queen in , she had to confirm the official surname of the Royal Family and many wanted her to continue using Windsor, instead of changing it to Mountbatten. Winston Churchill is said to have been an advocate for the Royals using the name Windsor and The Queenaposs grandmother, Queen Mary, agreed.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here. It is said to have caused such an issue that the matter was even discussed in Parliament. In the end, the Queen decided to support her familyaposs views and the name Windsor was used.At the time, Philip reportedly said: I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.The topic continued to bother him for years to come, but it wasnapost until  that Elizabeth decided to do something more about it. When the couple fell pregnant with their third child, Elizabeth was Queen and Philip was still keen for his children to have his surname. So in , Her Majesty is said to have gone to see Harold Macmillan, who had then taken over as PM. She said she absolutely needed to revisit the issue and admitted it had been irritating her husband since . Finally, a comprise was met, and on February ,  -  days before Prince Andrew was born - the Queen declared that she had adopted the name Mountbatten-Windsor. She announced that it would be used by all her descendants who do not enjoy the title of His or Her Royal Highness. And as we have seen, itaposs still used today. A statement on the Royal website explains: The Royal Family name of Windsor was confirmed by The Queen after her accession in . However, in , The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh decided that they would like their own direct descendants to be distinguished from the rest of the Royal Family , as Windsor is the surname used by all the male and unmarried female descendants of George V. It was therefore declared in the Privy Council that The Queenaposs descendants, other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince Princess, or female descendants who marry, would carry the name of Mountbatten-Windsor.

The Barbican Estate was hailed a city within a city when it first opened its doors to residents in . The site was branded as a utopia for hard-working, middle-class Londoners, with everything they could possibly need - a cinema, tennis courts, an arts centre, bars and schools, MyLondon reports.The Grade II-listed development, which sits across -acres of ground in the City of London, was designed by architects Chamberlin, Powell, and Bon. It was built by the City of London Corporation to get people to live in the financial district after it was obliterated during the Blitz. Today, around , people call the estate their home in over , apartments. The site is still run by the City of London but the vast majority of the flats are privately owned.Average property prices at the Barbican recently reached an eye-watering £million in  - a massive  per cent higher than . Miranda Quigley, , moved to the Barbican with her husband in September. They left their family home in Hertfordshire with a swimming pool and garden in search of a new way of le after their children moved out. The couple now live in a one-bed, one-bathroom flat with views of the London Eye. She said: We had an opportunity to change our lives and we did what most people don’t do - we moved into Central London. It’s an iconic part of London. I can remember coming here as a child. It had just opened and I remember thinking. ‘I’d like to live there one day’. I feel really excited that this dream has come true. While the flats are often small and expensive, Miranda said residents are well-looked after and there is a strong strong sense of community, which can be hard to find in London. She added: We didn’t even look at the Barbican at first because we thought it was expensive. But our estate agent suggested we come and look here. Prices had dropped quite a bit because of the pandemic.  Within  seconds we thought, ‘It’s perfect’. It isn’t what we were looking for - we wanted two beds and two bathrooms but it’s light, it’s bright, it’s a bit quirky. The service charges are really high everywhere in the City - like £, to £,. Here we pay £, a year but it feels like you’re getting something that’s worth paying for as all the maintenance is done really well. The listed status of the estate also makes it hard for residents to alter their flats. For example, wooden floors are banned because they make too much noise. Miranda said: There are some weird, quirky things. With it being such a huge entity, making change happen is quite dficult. If we wanted to put another toilet in here it would be virtually impossible. Resident Adam Hogg, , bought a flat at the Barbican five years ago. He added: We are right in the middle of London - you couldn’t be more central with public transport. I walk about the place at night just thinking how nice it is to be here. It’s absolutely lovely. I have come here to die. I have no intention of going anywhere . The former brewer and factory manager is a huge fan of the brutalist design of the estate and his uncle, also architect, was close friends with Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. He said: The flats are terric. There’s the architecture which is Marmite - you either love it or you don’t. I have always been brought up in modern houses.There are lots of architects, lawyers, professional people living here and people who make films. It’s a middle-class ghetto. It’s a lovely place to live and we have benevolent landlords in many ways. There are people who came here when it was built. Both Miranda and Adam said the City looks after them well but it could be more environmentally-friendly. The whole estate still has old, underfloor heating that is controlled by one provider and cannot be turned off. Miranda said: Sometimes we open the door because it’s so hot and we are trying to improve our carbon footprint and it’s a bit insane. Sometimes it feels criminal to let the heat out especially with what’s going on. Resident Fred Rodgers, , also said the design of the buildings can be a pain. He added: The underfloor heating charges are constantly rising because of electricity costs rising but there’s very little that can be done about it. But like the others, he said he loves the way of le at the Barbican, where he has lived with his we since . He added: We lived in a small basement flat in Marylebone and decided we wanted to move where there was light and the Barbican with its massive windows offers a massive amount of light. It has so many attractions. We can walk down to the cinema in slippers and our dressing gowns basically. We have got everything we could want. We are very well looked after and we are very privileged. Adam, also chair of the Barbican Association, which represent the thousands of people living on the estate, said living at the world-renowned site means lots of people are drawn to it, like noisy skateboarders who sometimes shout at them to get out the way. But he is less bothered by the endless stream of influencers having photoshoots outside their homes because it adds to the charm. Adam is also worried about the future of the arts centre, which is poised for a £ million revamp and the Museum of London, designed by his uncle, which is being moved to a new home. Like many residents, Adam hopes the City will preserve both the buildings at least on the outside. A City of London Corporation spokesperson said: “The Barbican Estate is home to thousands of residents who enjoy living in this iconic area of the Square Mile, and within walking distance of one of the largest multi-arts and learning institutions of its kind, the Barbican Centre. Residents who have any concerns about their living standards and accommodation are always encouraged to contact the Barbican Estate Office, which can offer them information and guidance on a wide range of issues. “Any changes to the Barbican Centre made as part of the upcoming Renewal Project will respect the building’s Grade II-listed and be developed in line with listed building planning regulations. “The views and ideas of the local community and other groups are - and will continue to be - important to us, because they help ensure that the Barbican Renewal Project meet the needs and demands of modern audiences. As the development proposals evolve, residents and other interested groups will be engaged and consulted with.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingCity of London CouncilCity Estate\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She had a perfect le. We were told she would never smile or get head support and that she would never sit on her own – she managed all those things,” Lisa said.  “She laughed constantly, she started waving and smiling. She developed her own little character. “All the things we thought she would never do, she did. And more. For a baby that was so poorly, she accomplished more in her nine months of le than most of us do in a year.”After a normal pregnancy, Lisa was concerned about her babyaposs movements and made her way to the University Hospital of North Tees in September  - when days later she was induced. On Friday, September , the health care assistant welcomed her daughter into the world via caesarean section.But it was only upon Nancy’s arrival that she and her midwery team recognised something was out of the ordinary. Nancy was taken straight to the special care baby unit which cares for premature or seriously ill newborns.  Lisa, , said: “When she was born, she didn’t cry. She had dficulty breathing – she had a wheeze. The only thing I remember saying was that she only had four fingers – she didn’t have her little finger on her left hand.” Medics found that Nancy had problems with her heart and kidneys, slanted eyes, webbed toes, a missing finger and she could not suck or swallow. The newborn was transferred from the University Hospital of North Tees to the paediatric intensive care unit at the Freeman Hospital. Lisa continued: “Two days after giving birth by C-section, I was travelling to Newcastle. I needed time to heal but Nancy came first. I was allowed to change her and hold her but she was so poorly. A doctor there asked meI understood how poorly she was. “He told me to take her home to meet her family because she won’t be here in  hours. They’d done all they could and we just had to wait and see now.” But three weeks later, on October , , Nancy came home. The following month, she was diagnosed with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome . Symptoms of SLOS dfer from person to person. Some people may have more symptoms than others and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Those with the syndrome also have abnormally low levels of cholesterol in their blood. Lisa knows of only two other iniduals in the North East with this condition – one of whom sadly died.Despite being given just  hours to live, Nancy defied doctors’ expectations, continuing to grow and develop. Although she remained under the care of several hospitals and specialists across the North East, Nancy lived a full le, Lisa said.She enjoyed her first Christmas at home, went on three holidays and laughed as she spent time in the water. But on July , , Nancy was taken to the University Hospital of North Tees by ambulance where she received treatment after Lisa noticed she was struggling to breathe.She sadly died on the children’s ward two days later of heart failure and sepsis.Lisa continued: “I was sat with her the whole time and one minute she was quiet and not moving much, then a few hours later she was lively and kicking her legs, playing. I was holding her in my arms and when I thought she’d gone to sleep, I put her back to bed and put her oxygen mask back on her and she just flopped to one side and was gone. She’d died in my arms. Doctors and nurses worked on her for  minutes. But she was ready to go – she was tired and she’d had enough. We say now that she didn’t want me to have to make that decision to give her open heart surgery which only has a % survival rate. “Nancy made her own decision.” Since Nancy’s passing in July last year, Lisa and her family have dedicated themselves to raising awareness of SLOS and raising money for the organisations who helped Nancy. She has raised and donated money, along with blankets and clothing, to the special care baby unit at the University Hospital of North Tees. Lisa said: “I can’t describe how thankful I am to everyone in the special care baby unit at North Tees - to Zoe Kitching and Jayne Jobling especially.“Jayne came to Nancy’s funeral and continues to be a great support to me, as are a lot of other nurses. Nancy simply wouldn’t have had her nine and a half months without the NHS.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Childrens HospitalBabies\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lidl’s Mister Choc Crunchy Peanut Butter was found to be the best value pick, costing p for g - p per g. At the other end of the scale was Sun-Pat, costing £. per g jar - or p per g. Other supermarket own-brand products were ranked better on taste. Big brand spread Marmite cost £. per g jar - £ per g - said Which   Yet Aldi’s Grandessa Mighty Yeast Extract was not only ranked top for taste but also costs £. per g jar - p per g.

A report from number crunchers NinIQ showed sales of branded grocery products fell by .% in the four weeks to March . Sales of own-label products were down less, at .%, while demand packaged “private label” ranged increased by .%. It meant the own-label products shares of all sales rose from .% a year ago to .% now.

Britains are being encouraged to break out the sunscreen as another mini heatwave is set to boost temperatures over the coming days, following the hot weather earlier in March.Over the next  days the weather is set to get warmer and more stable as high pressure builds pulling air in from the Atlantic.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express : “After the weekend we expect to see more in the way of high pressure building over the UK.“This could bring temperatures back up to something like we saw at the end of March.  “It will also turn more settled, again as we see high pressure taking more of a dominant effect over the weather.” But a risk of spring showers remains, with the possibility of downpours on Monday and Friday for much of the UK, despite rising temperatures. The start of the week will mark the end of the colder weather seen over the past week in parts of the country. Parts of Scotland and Northern Britain will be slower to catch up with the rising temperatures, with the possibility of frosts and wintry downpours remaining during the start of this week. Rain is also predicted early in the week for northern and western regions as low pressure moves in from the Atlantic.  However for many, Monday will see temperatures raising as the sun breaks through for the run up to the bank holiday. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said warmer weather is on the way for the start of the week.“With a southerly air flow, it is certainly going to feel warmer,we get some brightness in the southeast, temperatures could top out at C, mid-teens where,” he predicted. “For the next  days, the general trend is for it to turn warmer with higher pressure increasingly through next week and into the following next week.”  Britons could be in for a barbecue Easter weekend with highs of C possible next weekend, according to some forecasters. High pressure will build keeping chilly northerly winds out and allowing warm gusts in from the south. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: “It is going to warm up from where we are at the moment. “Next week we could see temperatures in the high teens, and I would not be surprisedby Easter weekend we saw C. “It is fair to say that the week to come is not going to be a bad one.”  Balmy forecasts have prompted books to slash the odds on an Easter scorcher with Ladbrokes offering - on an Easter sizzler. Spokesman Alex Apati said: At last it looks as though Brits will have something to smile about on the weather front, with a record-breaking Easter scorcher potentially on the cards. However, allergy sufferers should watch out for rising tree pollen levels as experts sound the hay-fever alarm. Airbourne allergens expert Max Wiseberg said: “High pollen counts are forecast across the south and east of England on Monday. “Tree pollen could be released earlier than usual and in a shorter space of time leading to a more severe tree-pollen season. “People with allergies should prepare a hay-fever kit to suit their needs which may contain antihistamines and a nasal balm.” Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said: “The mild theme is going to persist for a good part of next week. “The wind direction goes into reverse after the weekend bringing milder temperatures. “This is down to tropical maritime air from the southwest which could also bring some cloud and rain. “But, through the start of the week it is going to feel very pleasant, and we expect mild conditions to hold out for a good chunk of the week.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WeatherHolidaysHeatwave\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Clive Stephensonaposs loved ones say they were assured his plot would be next to his mother’s in Handsworth Cemetery, yet he has been buried on the very edge of the vast Birmingham burial ground.His sisters, Vivienne and Jean Honeyghan, say mourners were unaware of the change until Clive was placed in the ground on the day of his funeral. Then, it was too late to protest, Birmingham Live reports.Vivienne said: They could not have placed my brother farther from my motherthey tried. They’ve made him look like the black sheep of the family. To add to their anguish, father-of-seven Clive was placed in a plot so sodden, it was filling with water as the coffin was lowered into it, they say Birmingham City Council has met the family on-site in a bid to resolve the issue. They have offered to exhume the body, at their own cost, and place it in the grave of another sister, Ionia Stephenson, who died only months after Clive, a painter and decorator from Northfield.  The local authority has told them it cannot put Clive, one of nine siblings, close to his mother Rita’s -year-old grave because that section of the cemetery is no longer used for burials. But support worker Vivienne - a cousin of former boxing world champ Lloyd Honeyghan - alleges graves have been placed in the area since her brother’s funeral. Things have moved on since Clive’s death, from a brain tumour, in February . The grandmother of his three youngest children died and was buried close to him. For those children’s sake, the family no longer want his body exhumed. They want the council to pay for a memorial stone on Clive’s grave - as an acknowledgement of mistakes made - and say sorry. They are being supported by Bishop Desmond Jaddoo who conducted the funeral service at Handsworth’s New Le Wesleyan Church in March . For the bishop, the campaign is particularly poignant. Clive died in his arms after the cleric delivered the last rites. The dying man told Desmond in those final hours he wanted to be buried near his mother.  The bishop has dubbed the council’s handling of the matter “shoddy” and “arrogant”. He says the authority is no longer communicating with him or the family. Vivienne says she was too numbed by grief on the day of the funeral to fully comprehend her brother was being buried in the wrong plot. She said: “Clive’s last wish was to be buried near his mother and that was agreed. That was the plan. On the day of the funeral, it didn’t sink in, but I know now. I know one of my brothers asked, ‘why are we stopping here ’ On the day, grief does take over your mind, grief does blind you. “If I’d known, then and there, it was the wrong place I would’ve stopped it in a split second. A lot of the family were totally distraught, but, at the time, what can you do  “On the same day, I contacted the undertaker and said, ‘this is not what was agreed’. I was given an assurance they would look into it and, to use their words, ‘heads would roll’.” Vivienne has claimed she later learned a decision was made on the day of the funeral to change plots: the one where Clive was intended to be interred had become badly waterlogged. Yet he was placed in a pool of a grave. Even the bishop askedanything could be done to stop the water pouring in,” she said. “We paid so much money for that grave. We are a close family. He is miles from the rest of his family. His last wish has not been realised. The council messed up. We want them to take responsibility, we want an apology stating they have done this.” Those sentiments are echoed by sister Jean. The -year-old, from Handsworth, said: “I think this has been handled terribly. Now, the council don’t respond to our requests, they just blank us. “I was too distraught on the day to notice what was going on, I just assumed it was the right spot. I had to be led away because I was so distressed I was passing out. We are not asking for money, we just want it sorted. Our brother is not in the right place. I’m so emotional about it, it has broken me down.” Bishop Jaddoo is currently attempting to broker a solution. He told the Sunday Mercury: “I think the family have been treated shoddily, at no point were they told the grave was going to be moved. “Things have moved on. They no longer want their brother moved, they don’t want to go through the trauma again. His final wish was to be buried as close as possible to his mother. They buried him on the edge of Handsworth Cemetery, it could not be farther from his mother’s grave. “Birmingham City Council has failed to consult with the family, which shows arrogance by the council.” A spokesman for the local authority told the Sunday Mercury: “Unfortunately, the request for the late Mr Stephenson to be buried as close to his mother’s grave as possible was not passed onto Handsworth Cemetery prior to the funeral. However, any request to locate a grave in a specic area cannot be guaranteed due to the uncertainty of ground conditions, and the paperwork which the family of the late Mr Stephenson signed, makes this clear.

Iris Jones, , fell for Mohamed Ahmed Ibriham, , three years ago in  despite their massive -year age gap.The loved-struck couple married a year later in  but have had to spend time apart the past month after Mohamedaposs father fell ill and he rushed back to Cairo to visit him.But their month spent thousands of miles apart has lead Iris to a major revelation, and has helped her realise what a priceless gem her hubby is, Manchester Evening News reports.  Iris welcomed him home last weekend, then reflected on how lucky she is to have him on Facebook.The British grandma, from Somerset, was swept off her feet when she met Mohamed in  through a Facebook page for atheists. They tried to get married in Cairo just four days after they first met in person, but they didnapost have the right paperwork. They were eventually able to wed a year later, and he was able to move in with her shortly afterwards when he was granted a three-year visa. Iris wrote on Sunday: Love is knowing you look like s**t after a days housework and gardening, without a scrap of make up on dressed in my scruff! After a monthaposs absence, my wonderful husband will welcome me just the way I am, because thataposs what love is all about.Welcome home, Mohamed. Missing you this past month has made me realise what a priceless gem you are. This rough diamond of a we will be more appreciative of you in the future. In an earlier Facebook post, Iris uploaded a photo of a suitcase, and explained in the comments: My husband had to make an emergency dash to Egypt as his father was ill. The update comes after the pensioner made headlines in January  by sharing intimate details of their sex le.Speaking on ITVaposs This Morning, she had hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby blushing. Describing their first night of passion, Iris said: “Pretty rough. Nobody had been near me for  years. I thought I was a virgin again.“Can I say we used a whole tube of KY Jelly  I couldn’t walk the next day. I felt asI had been riding a horse. Saddle sore wasn’t in it. Anyway we got over that.”  The pairaposs romance caused a rt in Irisapos family, with her previously opening up about how her two sons, both in their mid-s, had struggled to come to terms with their mumaposs relationship with a man  years her junior.Speaking with the Sunday Mirror back in , she said: Darren [one of her sons] is worried Mohamed is just after my money and we had a big row which resulted in me asking him to leave the house.We have made up since, but I’ve asked him not to talk about it – I don’t want to argue. Her other son Steve, , was aposa bit wary,apos according to Iris, but said she thinks he will eventually accept Mohamed as his dad.“If he’s marrying me for my fortune he’ll be sadly disappointed because I live on a pension, she said to those who questioned why Mohamed was with her. I don’t suffer fools gladly. I’m honest and I’m truthful and I told him straight away he couldn’t be a freeloader. “In Egypt we were quite frivolous, going out to the best restaurants all the time and we split everything  . She said Mohamed had agreed to sign a pre-nup to prove his love for her. It’s me he wants – not my house, she said. “I’ve spent years making other people happy, now I just want to marry the man I love before I die.

Heaposs been spotted out and about with Kate on several occasions, and photographed with her in fancy dress at a rollerskating party before she married into the royal family. Sam was a guest at Kate and Williamaposs royal wedding, and the Duchess and sister Pippa were in the congregation for his nuptials to Bella Ballin. After his victory at Aintree, the Cambridges took to social media to congratulate their pal on his win.  We take a look at Kate and Samaposs unexpected relationship over the years. Tragic loss Kate and Sam became pals under tragic circumstances, as the Duchess was originally friends with the jockeyaposs younger brother Thomas. Thomas died in , just days after his th birthday. He was diagnosed with the bone cancer Ewing’s sarcoma in . Sam focused racing while dealing with the loss of his brother and was quick to reference him following his Grand National success, revealing that his initials were on his saddle. After Thomasaposs death, Kate organised a charity roller disco in London to raise money for a paediatric surgery ward named after him.Sheaposs pictured at the event wearing yellow hot pants and a green sequin top, while Sam wore a bright pink blazer with an orange top. Royal matchmakingAfter meeting at university and falling in love, Kate and Wills split in . The couple discussed the brief breakup during their engagement interview.Kate admitted: At the time, I wasn’t very happy about it, but it made me a stronger person. You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn’t realised.I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you’re younger. I really valued that time for me as well, although I didn’t think it at the time. William added: We were both very young… we were both finding ourselves and being d­ferent characters. It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, so it was just a bit of space and it worked out for the better. However before long they were back together, and Sam reportedly played a big part in their reunion. Despite awkwardness surrounding the breakup, the jockey decided to invite both of them to his aposFreakin Naughty-themed partyapos at his familyaposs Oxfordshire manson. According to MailOnline, Wills wore hot pants and a policeman helmet and Kate was dressed as a naughty nurse in fishnets. They were reportedly seen in deep conversation during the evening, and within just a few weeks they were back together. However Sam always plays down his role, saying in : There’s an idea that I was like Cupid with a bow and arrow.

The -year-old council worker moved into hotels and then a rental property as work was started by insurers but it stalled and the damage quickly worsened.Ian believes the bill to fix his digs in Walton Street in the cityaposs West End could now be as much as £million, reports the Daily Record. He said his le has been on hold this whole time with his home, which dates back  years, lying in ruins. He explained that pouring fat down the sink had originally blocked the drains and he was told by insurers Axa to move into a hotel for six weeks.Have you had a similar issue  Let us know at webnews@mirror The firm agreed to cover the cost of the flooring repair and move Ian into a hotel in . He says they took the keys off him, then kept them until last year. “I had spent seven years doing it up. It was my first home and one I thought I’d probably be in forever,” continued Ian. At first he was moved into posh hotels Malmaison and Blythswood Square while work was done to patch up the damage. But with the work dragging on, insurers moved him into a flat and gave him replacement furniture when all his possessions were put in storage. And the y delays meant the water damage had spread to the walls, with builders forced to strip them as well as the floors. The repair work halted and, when it wasn’t restarted by , Ian asked the Financial Ombudsman Serviceto intervene. He said: “It was incredibly frustrating. I was getting nowhere. It wasn’t just the cost of the property. All my possessions were put into storage, where they remain. I’ve had to replicate my le.”  An FOS ruling found Axa had “mistreated” Ian as well accusing Axa of treating him “with contempt”. Despite the damning report, Axa didn’t restart the work again until  – after two more rulings by the FOS. By this time, the concrete foundations of the basement home had been damaged and new quotes to fix the building stretched to an incredible £,. Builders put in a support frame for the walls and heating to dry out the flat but then walked away and haven’t been back. In  Ian bought another home after being out of his first for so long. Axa stopped paying his expenses in September  – including funding for the   radiators that blast hot air into the damp home, which cost £ per month and which Ian now covers. He added: “They gave me my keys back last year and I couldn’t believe what it has been left like. Since they stopped paying my expenses, I have invoiced them for my costs and it now runs to over £,. I’m paying the utilities, mortgages and council tax in two properties. “Axa said they would repair the work. I don’t want to settle. I’ve not heard from them since  and even my lawyer is now being snubbed.” Axa, whose most recent offer to settle was £,, said: “We sympathise with Mr Gibbon’s situation. However, the majority of damage to his property was not caused by the original water leak for which he is insured. We’ve offered a cash settlement and continue to communicate via his legal representative.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingAssociation of British Insurers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Thrive scheme sees youth workers equipped to host workshops to improve the confidence of young people in dealing with their finances. Visitng the Norborok Youth Club in Wythenshawe, south Manchester, Rashford said: “A lot of kids are scared to go to a bank and that’s not surprising because they don’t teach you about money mindset at school. “For those who grew up in the sort of area that I did, it’s about what you don’t have, rather than what you could achieve.The positive and empowering element doesn’t register in their heads. “It’s not hard to reverse that but not many people are trying to change that. “I know so many talented young people who could really benefit from a program like this, who could actually propel themselves into something much bigger and achieving their goals.”As well as at Norbrook, the programme devised with the National Youth Agency is being piloted at St. Mary’s Youth Centre in Primrose Hill, north London and Sunderland’s Lambton Street Youth Centre. A national roll-out is scheduled for the summer. NatWest CEO Alison Rose told Rashford: “You’re mum’s given you the framework, so that you know what to do, which is really powerful. “We’re in people’s lives from the very beginning. “If we can give people the tools to be economically secure and know what to do and not to see something to be frightened of, it can be empowering of their le rather than something that holds them back.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Food and energy bills are rising and donapost even mention childcare costs.Everyone is feeling the pinch right now and looking for ways to save money.I have to admit, I had heard of the Too Good To Go app from a very good friend, who often shared how she had picked up some amazing bargains from the likes of Starbucks, Costa and Morrisons, Hull Live reports.For those who donapost know, the app lets people buy food at a great price every day to stop delicious fresh produce from going to waste at cafes, restaurants and shops, just because it hasnapost sold in time. You donapost know what you are going to get, so it can be a gamble, but I was willing to put it to the test. I had a long day at work and missed the chance to go to the supermarket for our weekly shop as needed to get my boys from school and nursery. Instead of spending £ plus on a takeaway for the four of us, and still wanting to get some nutrition, I put my faith in ordering two carvery magic bags from West Bulls pub, part of the Stonehouse pizza and carvery company.  I placed our order - which came to £. in total - what a steal ! - and my husband went to collect the bags at the specied time slot we had. When he got there, all he had to do was show our order on the app and the bag was waiting for us. When he got home and we opened the bag in front of us, I was blown away by the sheer amount of food. We could easily have fed another family-of-four. We had Yorkshire puddings, mounds of mashed potato and roasties, dozens of slices of tender roast beef, lashings of gravy, four humungous sausages, stuffing balls and lots of fresh vegetables including carrots, peas, broccoli, sweetcorn and cabbage.  I plated up for four - and there were still lots left over. I wouldnapost be exaggeratingI said we could have fed two more adults and two more children. And, most importantly - the taste  It was delicious and it tasted very fresh and no dferent to asyou were eating homecooked food. My personal favourite was the roast beef and vegetables , whereas my husband and boys loved the sausages and Yorkshire puddings. I knew it was good as the boys in the family were so stuffed, they couldnapost even manage a dessert. In-fact my husband couldnapost eat anything until late afternoon the following day. I will definitely use the app againwe fancy a treat and a bargain price. I also felt good that we had stopped food going to waste. I am even thinking of going for a magic bag from Starbucks or Costa for an afternoon work pick-me up.

However many churches have now realised their leather muffles are rotten as they have not been used since King George VIaposs death  years ago.As a result, leatherworkers have been inundated with orders as churches rush to ensure theyaposre ready for the sad day, reports the Mail on Sunday. Sales have reportedly doubled in the past few months. Vicki Chapman, from the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, told the newspaper that adding the muffle turns the bellsapos normal dong, dong, dong into more of a thudding sound. She said: We have spent a lot of time talking to the Royal Household and Lambeth Palace about the day the monarch passes, which we hope will not be any time soon. It is important as it is about paying due reverence to the service of the monarch and commemorating her le.”  Last year full details of Operation London Bridge were leaked, giving a full day-to-day run down of what will happen when the Queen passes away. The day will be known as D Day, with the days following called D Day plus the number of days that have passed. For example the second day will be D Day Plus One. Prince Charles - who will become King upon his motheraposs passing - will address the nation on the day of her death, while the Prime Minister will be the first government member to issue a statement. Government departments have been instructed to have flags at half mast within  minutes of the announcement, with Cabinet members set to be called with the sad news and urged to show discretion.  The Queen will be buried  days after she dies, it is expected, and Charles will embark on a tour of the UK before the burial is held. The sovereignaposs coffin will lie in state for three days at the Houses of Parliament, with authorities anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to descend on London - sparking fears over gridlock, policing and even food shortages. Any other Parliamentary business is set to be suspended for  days, it is reported. The day of the funeral will be a Day of National Mourning, but employers will not be compelled to give staff a day off. The service will take place at Westminster Abbey, and a two minute silence will be held across the UK at noon. A committal service will be held at St Georgeaposs Chapel, which is at Windsor Castle, where the Queen will be buried at King George VI Memorial Chapel.

The -year-old monarch tested ­positive for coronavirus in February but carried on performing duties in isolation from Windsor Castle.She spoke about her condition during a video call with the Royal London Hospital to mark the official opening of its Queen Elizabeth Unit. Talking to former Covid patient Asef Hussain, and his we Shamina, the Queen said: “It does leave one very tired and exhausted, doesn’t it  This horrible pandemic. It’s not a nice result.” Mr Hussain was the third member of his family to be admitted to hospital with Covid in December .  While he was in a coma for seven weeks after being put on a ventilator, his brother died and his father passed away. Mrs Hussain told the Queen at one point there were  friends and family on a Zoom call praying for her husband. The monarch made them smile when she joked: “So you have a large family, or a large influence on people ”  On Wednesday, she heard how the -bed unit in East London was built in record time to treat around  patients. Her Majesty was told by one senior nurse: “We held their hands, we wiped their tears and we provided comfort.”  Hospital chaplain Imam Faruq Siddiqi explained that families “felt a sense of hope” when he visited their loved ones. “Although I didn’t hold any miracles, I hope I was able to bring some sort of comfort to them through my presence and prayers,” he said. The Queen said: “It obviously was a very frightening experience to have Covid very badly, wasn’t it ” He replied: “What made it worse was being by themselves.” “Exactly. So they were alone, too,” the monarch said.  She was also introduced to the men who built the care unit in just five weeks, Paul Chandler and Jeff Barley. Her Majesty said: “It is very interesting, when there’s some very vital thing, how everybody pulls together. Marvellous, isn’t it ” Mr Barley hailed the “little bit of Dunkirk spirit” involved, prompting the smiling monarch to reply: “Thank ­goodness it still exists.” The Queen, who had “mild cold-like” ­Covid symptoms, has been suffering from mobility issues, forcing her to cancel a number of public engagements. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday that she had decided not to attend an annual Easter church service. Prince Charles will for the first time represent her at the Royal Maundy Thursday service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, Berks.

Brendon Grimshaw, from Dewsbury, in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, abandoned his high-pressured old le in the face of unemployment - before the age of  - and took an extended holiday. In , he purchased Moyenne, a tiny island just half a mile wide in the luxurious Seychelles, a cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean.The ex-journalist immediately fell in love with his new home, with its tranquil silence and wild tangle of vegetation, Yorkshire Live reports.Brendon lived almost completely alone on the island. Moyenne had been left abandoned for decades, prior to his arrival and was so overgrown that falling coconuts were said to never reach the ground.  It has previously been likened to a tiny rainforest erupting from the ocean. With the help of -year-old Rene Antoine Lafortune, the son of a local fisherman, Brendon set about forging paths through the undergrowth. They also planted trees in an attempt to transform the island. Brendon built a humble wooden home for himself. But to truly transform the island he knew he would need to nurture itaposs wildle back to full health. He gradually introduced giant tortoises to his corner of the Indian Ocean and eventually shared Moyenne with  of the indigenous creatures.  Brendonaposs relentless hard work inevitably attracted the attention of wealthy investors, who viewed the Seychelles as a tropical paradise and an ideal spot for a luxury holiday destination. The aposreal le Robinson Crusoeapos - also since compared to the Tom Hanks character in the  film Castaway - is said to have turned down close to £million for his small island. But he wanted to ensure its future in a dferent way, and not to line corporate pockets. As he had no children to pass the island to at the time of his death, Brendon signed a perpetual trust with the Seychellesapos Ministry of Environment in . The agreement marked the islandaposs transformation into a National Park. To this day, it remains the smallest island in the world to hold that title. Brendon passed away in  and his grave sits alongside that of his father, who came to live with him in later le. His tombstone reads: Moyenne taught him to open his eyes to the beauty around him and say thank you to God. The island is now overseen by the Moyenne Island Foundation and remains largely undeveloped.A restaurant serving local dishes, a small museum dedicated to Brendonaposs le, and two nurseries for giant tortoise hatchlings form the only additions to the area, reports the BBC. No more than  visitors are allowed on the island at any one time, even during peak tourist season.

Several homes in Beville Street, Fenton, have had chalk marks left on the walls, sparking fear among families.Plain circles and circles with a diagonal line have been drawn in white chalk on the properties. The method is often associated with burglaries and has also been linked to dog thefts, the Stoke Sentinel reports.However, utility workers are also known to leave signs on walls to indicate an area has been checked for potential issues like a gas leak or to earmark where a water pipe is located.  Nick Taylor lives in one of the homes that has been marked in Beville Street. The -year-old says it has left him feeling aposworriedapos. He said: Iaposve heard about people doing it. Itaposs usually done for dogs. My doorbell picks up on anyone who walks outside my house, so I will have a look through my doorbell footage for anyone suspicious. Iaposll be keeping an eye out and Iaposll wash the mark off and have a look up the street. Cha Colemanaposs property, in Beville Street, has also been marked. The -year-old said: Itaposs peculiar. A lady messaged me a few weeks ago about people using chalk to mark houses.  I never saw anyone do it. Iaposm a bit creeped out. Iaposll just be keeping an eye out. Touch wood, weaposve lived here since  and had nothing other than two bikes stolen last year. I work from home, so Iaposd see themthey tried to break in as Iaposm home all the time. Maybe itaposs just a utility company because itaposs on almost every house. George Millwardaposs property in Beville Street has not been marked with the chalk, but he says everyone in the street is keeping an eye out. The -year-old said: Iaposve been told itaposs burglars. We donapost have one on our house, but one or two have got them. Iaposm not worried about it because Iaposve got nothing for them to pinch. But everyone is keeping more of an eye out. We always do, me and the we.  I hope itaposs just something innocent. The police have been informed by a woman up the road. She told the police about it after she had a marking appear. The Safeguarding Hub - which shares home protection advice and information across the UK - previously said: Between us, we have a fairly extensive knowledge of burglary. We have spent many hours speaking to distraught victims, visiting crime scenes and dealing with burglars. We have actually seen and experienced these symbols being used by criminals. This is not to say that this is a common practice between bands of thieves, for most burglars work alone. We do not want to scaremonger and we can say confidentially that the use of these symbols is very rare.  But,you are a caregiver to an elderly or vulnerable person and spot strange marks outside their home, do you really want to dismiss it out of hand without just ensuring that the symbol is legitimate  Elsewhere in the country, the symbols have been dubbed the aposDa Pinci Codeapos with dferent signs for aposnothing worth stealingapos, aposwealthyapos and aposgood targetapos. A triangle symbol is used to show a single woman lives in the property on her own, or vertical lines could imply a house has obvious valuables inside. Also keep an eye out for the letters ‘M’, which tells other burglars to strike in the morning, whereas ‘N’ means a night-time intrusion.

Trafford  Builders uncovered a -year-old nuclear bunker under Trafford town hall as part of its multi-million pound renovation. A maze of bricked tunnels, foot-thick steel and reinforced concrete, the vast chamber was designed to house top brassthe nuclear sirens sounded. The ,sq ft fall-out shelter was designed as part of the council’s s extension to the town hall. Its inclusion in the plans caused outrage among anti-nuclear campaigners, who furiously attacked it as a waste of money. But town hall chiefs said it was an ‘essential’ part of its civil defence against an all-out attack. Now empty apart from a generator and air filtration system, the labyrinth, built by structural engineer Ray Higham once included a cavernous storage room of dried food, government radio equipment and – rumour has it – a morgue.Cheadle Built in the height of The Cold War, The Mill Lane bunker in Cheadle, which was designed to withstand direct missile attacks, was intended to house bigwigs while they sat out nuclear hostilities before emerging into a devastated but presumably fall-out free world.Ten years after being put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence, the bunker was demolished to make way for more car parking spaces for staff working at the nearby Alexandra Hospital.Although it had  rooms, the musty-smelling bunker, built with five feet-thick concrete walls, was built to accommodate up to  people, the bunker was intended as a command post for ministers in the event of a nuclear holocaust and contained an antiquated telephone switchboard as well as emergency generators and telecommunications equipment. Manchester city centre  Manchesteraposs nuclear bunkers - hidden ft beneath the streets between St Peteraposs Square and Piccadilly Gardens - were refurbished and offered for rent as offices. The network of tunnels, which spreads under the city out to Ardwick and Salford, removed from the protection of the Official Secrets Acts in the s, are still guarded around the clock by security staff. But they are unknown to the vast majority of people who walk above them daily. The entrances to the tunnels, including two in George Street, are surrounded by barbed wire and security gates. Telephone Exchange, as it is called, has a main tunnel running more then  yards from St Peteraposs Square up to the Piccadilly Plaza Hotel in the city centre. Smaller tunnels run across the city. They were built in the s when the fear of nuclear war was at its height and were so secret that Polish immigrants unable to speak a word of English were employed to build them. In the event of the city being damaged by an atomic bomb, the tunnels would have be used to maintain vital telecommunication networks with other cities across the UK. Worsley Woods Tucked away in a far corner of the RHS Bridgewater site in Worsley, a relic from the Cold War is now camouflaged by graffiti as well as foliage, and has been a destination for so-called aposurban explorersapos.Dug into hillside in , the bunker was constructed when the potential of a nuclear strike by a Joseph Stalin-led Soviet Russia was deemed to be at its height.It was built by the War Office as an anti-aircraft operations room on land at Worsley New Hall, and was part of a national network of defences which included an alternative seat of government to the House of Commons - underground at Box Hill near in Corsham in Wiltshire. Oldham  At the height of global panic, a nuclear bunker was built under the then newly-constructed Oldham Civic Centre. It was designed to act as a safe room to protect the town’s decision-makers and civic leaders from any nuclear attack or fall-out. Thankfully it was never used, but many thousands of people have walked into the ft-high tower off West Street ever since without knowing what lies beneath their feet. Today the bunker, made up of subterranean corridors and rooms, is used for storage. The dferent chambers, reinforced by concrete and brick, were part of the centre’s overall design. It opened in  but the bunker wasn’t publicised.

Met Office weather meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: “Warmer weather is on the way for the start of the week, and we could even see C in the southeast. “The general trend is for it to turn warmer with higher pressure increasingly likely through the week and into the following week. “There is still the chance of some rain mainly in the west.” While some of us will once again be putting away the winter woollies, those further north in Scotland and the north-west of England are likely to see rain and some colder temperatures.  Mr McGivern said: “Into Monday, low pressure becomes more and more erratic, but it looks likely that northern and western parts of the UK will bear the brunt of any wetter weather. “Low pressure is slowly progressing from the west bringing some rain in on Sunday, most likely in north-west of the UK, western Scotland, western England and north Wales. “Cold air remains in the far north with the potential for snowthat rain mixes with cold air as it approaches from the west.”The rain is forecast to ease from Good Friday until April , as it moves eastwards,The Independentreports. According to the Met Office’s longer-term predictions, showers were possible in the Midlands over the Easter period. “For the rest of the period, a northwest-southeast split is likely, with the northwest remaining more changeable with strong winds and rain at times,” the Met Office said. “Some rain may occasionally spread into parts of the southeast at first, but it is likely to turn dry and become generally much more settled, though perhaps rather cloudy, in the south, with lighter winds through to the end of this period. “Temperatures are expected to be above average, and warm at times for the south.”  Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, last week said the general trend for this week was a rise in temperatures. If things play out, we could be looking at C or C in the south over Easter,” he added. Warm weather comes with a warning for hay-fever sufferers with tree pollen levels predicted to soar next week. Airborne allergens expert Max Wiseberg said: The start of the tree pollen season has been slow, with the poor weather so far most of this spring. But it looks asthe season could start in earnest with high pollen counts forecast across the South and East of England on Monday.

The -year-old dotes on her cat Tigger, a tabby who she rescued from the streets, to the point where sheaposll put his needs first.The former retail worker, who now receives Jobseeker’s Allowance, told LeedsLive : “No matter what money I’ve got left over after paying the bills, no matter whether I could afford to buy food for myself, my cat came first and I always came second.However, in August last year, Kelly found a leline in the form of a St Giles Trust Pantry, in Chapeltown, Leeds. The food bank lets people in need fill up two big bags of groceries for the small price of £..  “So I could live on beans and toast for a fortnight so I could feed my cat. I’ve lived on beans on toast and eggs on toast. Since coming down here, as you can see, I’ve been able to get a full shop. With the cooked meat that they do, I mainly get it for my cat. If I can’t afford cat food, I know that my cat has got something to eat.” The food bank, which is located on Saville Mount, has been open for around  months. The staff understand that accepting help with necessities like food can be embarrassing and challenging for those in need, so they’ve tried to make the visit as nice as possible. There’s a comfy sofa that people can sit on, along with a coffee table and a rug which make the centre feel homely. Staff offer out cups of tea or coffee while they chat with people who come in for support. Sybil Beckford, a grandmother-of-one and mother-of-three, said she was struggling to pay for food before visiting the food bank. The -year-old cleaner recounted how she would often be unable to pay the bill at the supermarket counter, surprised at the rising prices for food.  Sybil said: “This place makes a big dference. “When you go into town to buy certain stuff, the prices keep going up. I’m one of those who pick something [an item] up in the shop and don’t look at the price. Then when I take it to the counter, I can’t pay for it.” Staff at the St Giles Trust offer a range of services, which also includes offering support to ex-convicts who are rehabilitating into society, vulnerable women, children and families. Gill Gaunt, the community service delivery manager, said: We like to be informal so people can come in and have a chat to us, it’s all confidential, about any issues they may have. Some people come in who have issues around social services, around their children, and we offer a lot of advice.  The -year-old, who has been a part of the trust for  years, added: “We wanted to make it feel like everyone who comes here could just have a chat with us. Iaposm sort of like a manager here but I’m just the same as everyone . Eva Bennett-Gibson, who has been working as a children and families case worker there since , can often be seen loading up people’s shopping bags with all the grocery items. “People know they can come here and take home some food without being judged and not looked down upon,” Eva said. “They know that we’re here with open doors. We’re supportive when people come in and take them around, make sure they know there’s support on offer all the time and we’re here to help.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON povertyFood banksCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However it turns out our bedding and mattress are a hotbed for bacteria and other gross things, and many people are guilty of not washing their sheets often enough.Some people may go a few weeks or even a month without changing the duvet cover, but the experts at online-bedrooms stress it needs to be done once a week.They explain that your favourite pillow can accumulate over several thousand times more bacteria than a toilet seat in just seven nights. Luckily, the organisms found on pillowcases are largely harmless and are simply a build up of skin cells, sweat and saliva. Another mistake many of us may be making is how often we change our mattress. Itaposs hardly an exciting purchase, so many people donapost really think about splashing out on a new one unless they need to.  However, it too is a nesting place for germs and you could be sharing your bed with yeast, mould and bacteria. As well as microbes, skin cells and food particles that are transferred to our mattresses from our bodies, a factor in making mattresses such a germy spot is gravity. Airborne particles of dust and debris float around the bedroom before settling on the bed. The experts recommend replacing your mattress every seven to eight years.Nic Shacklock from online-bedrooms said: “It is no secret that germs live all over our houses, however there are lots of hidden spots that we may not ever think about during our cleaning rituals.“Spots like pillowcases and curtains might look fresh and clean, they are hiding a range of nasty bacteria that could lead to enhanced allergies, unpleasant odours and skin issues.” Bur perhaps the most surprising germ hotspot is bedroom lamps, which collect a huge amount of germs but tend to be missed during cleaning. Their surfaces offer space for dust and dirt to settle and are common touch points so need to be wiped and disinfected every week.

Liz, from London, went on to speak out against social media, saying that some trends encourage unhealthy lestyles that can be hugely damaging for young people who follow them. What do you think about Lizaposs advice  Let us know in the comments... Liz, who posts on Instagram as Liz Bites Back, said: I used to suffer from an eating disorder, it wasnapost caused by social media but that made it worse.There are a few issues, one is that there are unrealistic expectations - everyone wants to get their best angles, but no one walks around with a six-pack every day. Some days I have a flat stomach, some I donapost and thataposs fine. Itaposs about having that realistic approach. People deserve to have these realistic expectations, many end up in a toxic cycle because thataposs what weaposve been led to believe.  You get body trends, in  there was the thigh gap, and for men there were aposvapos lines, people see these and try to achieve them and then something  begins to trend. I think that cycle needs to be broken. For someone like me, who has struggled with body image, it does amply those negative feelings about yourself. It changes how you view yourself and how you react to food. I think people forget how much influence social media has. Also, a lot of influencers get paid for endorsements - they will just jump on that to make money and they have huge followers who think what theyaposre selling is a good thing.  Most accounts are selling quick fixes, and thataposs what people want as a society. I guess itaposs down to trends and social media pressures.Inspired to make a change, Liz launched her online coaching website Bite Back With Liz, where she teaches people how to achieve their goals in a physically and mentally healthy way.She continued: I saw a stat the other day and it was  per cent of people in the UK have tried a fad diet, they are often endorsed by social media influencers.  There are low-calorie diets and things like that, it spirals out of control. You lose the weight really quickly but then you put it on and more because you go and binge drink because youaposve been so restrictive. We are told as a society to go to extremes to get the results we want, but Iaposm trying to change that. Iaposm against the health and fitness norms, I try and promote women to achieve those results without changing their diet at all.

Towards the end of the ultrasound she actually flipped us off on both hands at dferent times and towards the very end she did the peace sign. When she put her middle finger up I just started laughing because I kind of have that kind of attitude myself so it was just really funny I was like aposoh, sheaposs like me already weaposre in troubleapos.

It was really dficult because you have all this excitement at the opportunity that this medication can really help you and it didnapost take that long, it only took four cycles, but then month after month, thereaposs a lot of letdowns because you think aposthis could be itapos.And then you wait two weeks after the treatment to take a pregnancy test and you start to get period symptoms but also theyaposre the same symptoms of pregnancy, so itaposs a lot of disappointment and anticipation.When I got the positive pregnancy test I didnapost believe it and literally took  tests and I still didnapost believe it, then had two blood tests and still didnapost believe it, and truthfully, I still donapost believe it.

Limescale is a hard, chalky deposit, that can be found around the home in bathrooms and kitchens around taps, toilet bowls, baths, pipes and any water area you come into contact with on a daily basis. Not only does it look unsightly, but it can also do a lot of damage to your pipes. Thankfully, thereaposs one ingredient that can help to remove limescale in just five minutes - and itaposs sitting in your kitchen cupboard. Cleaning fans shared their top tips on how to get rid of the stains on Reddit, but one, in particular, stood out. One user said the secret to ridding the stubborn grime is to use something acidic.  F or more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. They said: Start with white vinegar, though brown works just as well. Put some in a spray bottle, spray it on, wait five mins then give it a scrub. Do this a few times. As limescale is made of calcium carbonate, an alkaline, the high percentage of acetic acid it contains works to break through the hard deposits. The Reddit user continued: If vinegar does no good, you can try other acids. The strongest one is aposSpirit of Saltsapos. Use with great caution, follow the instructions on the bottle, ventilate the area thoroughly and wear protective gear as it will advise. I applied a dilute solution with a brush and it worked a treat for me. You can pick up white vinegar in most supermarkets for as cheap as £.This comes as a man shared the aposcorrectapos way to fit toilet rim block. Fabian Coghetto said that instead of hooking the item over the toilet bowl like most of us do, you should push it inside the rim of the toilet. It should then lock into place. This means that the toilet seat will sit flush rather than resting on the plastic.Take a look at how itaposs done, here. Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Two-year-old Chloe Hope chopped the top of her previously shoulder- blonde locks into a cm-long circular patch on the top of her head, resembling the style of the Robin Hood character and appeared pretty pleased with her handiwork. Usually, her parents keeps scissors hidden away out of reach, but theyaposd been put on a countertop while the family was busy decorating their home. Mum Jo Hope, who works as a hairdresser and colour technician, went to the bathroom to brush her teeth. When she ed, she was left horried by the sight of young Chloe proudly clutching tufts of her hair and announcing that she looked pretty. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Over the course of the next few weeks, Jo, , kept Chloeaposs head covered with hats and headbands, desperately trying to hide the unusual hairdo as best as possible.However, two months later, the toddleraposs hair wasnapost looking much better as sheaposd ended up with a style similar to that of David Bowieaposs iconic s cut from the movie Labyrinth. Jo, from Durham, County Durham, recalled: Sheaposd pretty much made a short circular patch of hair on her head. She loved it, she thought she looked fantastic, I was mortied. Being a hairdresser I felt a certain amount of pressure [to sort it] but sadly all we could do was let it grow. Sheaposd literally scalped herself so I called her Friar Tuck because she did look like him and when it grew back she looked like David Bowie [from Labrynth]. This was back in July  with the mullet growing in by September of the same year. Chloeaposs dad, Chris, who happens to be a massive Bowie fan, jokingly encouraged his little girl to keep the cool haircut just as it was.However, Jo initially wasnapost laughing and was in fact furious at Chris for not thinking to keep the scissors out of reach in the first place, confessing that she could have killed him. Jo recalled: My husband didnapost want them to get put away with the decorating stuff so he moved them, not realising that they were in reach of her. When this happened I knew that Chris had moved my scissors, I went absolutely mad. When he came home he was a bit shocked but did find it quite funny, I on the other hand could have killed him. I started to see the funny side later on that day. I called a friend of mine because I was in panic mode. She has two little ones near enough the same age as Chloe and she came round. She just burst out laughing and it made me feel better. Now six, Chloe, has managed to grow back her long blonde hair down to her bum, with Jo having to shape it around her face to keep it tamed. Despite her initial shock, on reflection, Jo believes her young daughter possesses a fair bit of hairdressing talent. The mum added: As a hairdresser, I rate her skills with the scissors  , absolutely fantastic. It was a nice close cut, she didnapost hurt herself in the process either. If she doesnapost become a barber with those shearing skills, Iaposll be surprised.Do you have a hilarious hair disaster-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Washington is reportedly banking on the growth of the western alliance from  to  members, as a direct consequence of President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.US officials said both Nordic countries attended talks between NATO’s foreign ministers last week, during which membership was a “topic of conversation and multiple sessions”, The Times reported. “How can this be anything but a massive strategic blunder for Putin ” one senior American official asked.Washington is expecting Finland’s application in June, while Sweden is expected to follow suit soon after. Both are neighbouring countries to Russia, which sits just across the Baltic Sea. Finland also shares an -mile land border with Russia.Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin has said it was time for her country to seriously reconsider its stance on joining the alliance.  Speaking on the weekend, she said Russia was not the neighbour she once thought it was. “I think we will have very careful discussions, but we are also not taking any more time than we have to in this process, because the situation is, of course, very severe,” she said. Similarly to Finland, Sweden is carrying out a security policy review expected to be completed by the end of the month. Magdalena Andersson, the Swedish prime minister, said a fortnight ago that she did “not exclude Nato membership in any way”. While the two countries were working together to build domestic consensus, the final decisions would be taken independently. The countries are working together to build domestic consensus but, officials emphasise, the final decisions will be taken independently. Late in February, just days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin threatened Sweden and Finland with apos military and political consequencesaposthey joined NATO.Maria Zakharova, Russiaaposs foreign ministry spokeswoman, said there would be serious repercussions for their close Arctic neighbours. Zakharova said during a news briefing: Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on this warning. “Everything is about mutual deterring and should one side — and we consider Nato to be one side — be more powerful than the other, especially in terms of nuclear arms, then it will be considered a threat for the whole architecture of security and it will take us to take additional measures,” he said. NATO now has , troops under its direct command in eastern Europe, from the Balstic to the Black Sea. Its force has increased nearly tenfold since Russia invaded Ukraine on February .  The alliance is making plans to deploy a permanent full-scale military force on members’ borders to prevent a further Russian invasion as it adapts to a “new reality. NATO’s general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, said Putin’s actions had provoked a “fundamental transformation” of the military coalition, which would reflect the long-term consequences of the war in Ukraine. The bolstering of NATO’s military power would be carried out with the aim of enabling countries that share borders with Russia and Belarus to repel an attempted invasion. If Finland and Sweden join NATO, Putin would be expected to redeploy troops to his northwestern flank, putting further pressure on his stretched military. European diplomats have said the addition of both countries to NATO would signicantly bolster the group’s capabilities, particularly in terms of intelligence-gathering and air force powers. Nato membership for Finland and Sweden would prompt redeployment on Putin’s northwestern flank, further stretching his military, which has been badly affected by Ukraine’s resistance and the prolonged conflict.

Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked. Always climb gates at the hinge end.On reaching large farm sheds take the small bridge over Killean burn and cut through the field to the shore.Your route once more wends its way down the beach, over an igneous dyke and Permian red sandstone, all the way back to A’Chleit. Allow an hour for this section when checking tides.If you finish early enough there may even be time to pop down to Glenbarr stores for a well-deserved cuppa."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 28 2021 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTaken just across Loch Fyne from Tarbert, this week#s featured photo was submitted by a reader from Cowal # too modest to be named, sadly # from the site of the controversial #ark# on the hills above Tighnabruaich.The sculpture of Noah#s Ark was built # without planning consent, though later permitted # to provoke thought about the climate crisis by local environmentalist and woodworker David Blair.The sculpture has been featured many times in this and other publications, but the site on which it sits is stunning, and the photographer was standing close to the ark for the photograph.To the left is the Isle of Bute, with Tighnabruaich and Kames on the opposite side of the Kyles of Bute.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Many are willing to go the extra mile to help.I am pleased to congratulate, and thank, Campbeltonians for their collective attributes, which the rest of the country would do well to aspire to.I would like to set the record straight regarding South Islay Development ’s Port Ellen playing fields #community hub# development which was covered in last week’s Campbeltown Courier.I am one of the objectors who went round every door in Port Ellen. We gathered hundreds of signatures against this, which got the first lot of plans scrapped.So SID changed the plan to suit the roads department and resubmitted the planning application.Most of the objectors didn’t know they had to object again.SID didn’t knock on every door and ask how folk felt about it. They put leaflets through people#s doors and a lot of people didn’tthem.They also had open days, normally through the week, when people are working and can’t attend.And that is the reason I, for one, couldn’t attend the virtual planning, protective services and licensing committee meeting. People have full-time jobs and can’t attend these things at am on a Thursday.The community of Port Ellen is ided over this development.This was always intended to be a community space and now it’s being developed for tourism.We know and understand something has to happen in the area but it should have been to benefit the community, not more space going to tourism.The campervans are an eyesore but don’t think we’re saying we don’t want them on Islay, but there are places better suited for them outside the village.Equally, the people in these campervans will probably pick somewhere they have a good view, quiet and relaxing, rather than by the main road, where all ferry traffic passes.Islay will soon be unrecognisable, all for tourists and nothing for the locals. It will soon be another Skye.It’s unaffordable for people to come here for a week#s holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 8 2022","story":"Susan took the shot last week while enjoying a walk with her dog.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 8 2022","story":"Perhaps, like mine, it’s not as good as it once was, and you forget things you should recall.Or perhaps it’s too good, and your recall things you should forget.What about God’s memory  Surely, he doesn’t forget.No, he doesn’t. Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve. He forgives you and remembers your sins no more."},{"url":null,"title":"west road overnight surfacing works rescheduled","story":"Due to operational reasons, the project will now begin on Sunday, April , for  nights.No works will take place on Fridays or Saturdays.

sunshine was breaking through the last remaining wisps of morning mist. Signs of spring, my favourite season, were visible all over our garden. The blackbird was perched on the fence and I opened the window so I could hear his song better.I watched him for a moment. He is a regular visitor but he seemed particularly vocal this morning. Then I noticed there was a female blackbird as well. I felt privileged that I could witness their visit to our small rewilded garden, which we have tried to make bird friendly.Then the singing stopped and they both seemed to be peering down at the patch of soil where we have recently planted wildflower seeds and vegetables. The male landed on the soil and began hopping in a zig-zag fashion, stopping every now and then. At first I wonderedthis was a dance to impress the female, but soon realised he was looking for breakfast.Blackbirds love earthworms and I supposed the overnight rain on the exposed soil of our newly seeded flowerbed meant it was a good moment to go hunting for his favourite food. He was looking for worms, but also listening for them, as blackbirds can hear the sound of them moving underground. I find that almost dficult to believe, but apparently it’s true. It was fascinating and joyous to watch.But I don’t knowhe caught any worms. My attention was taken by the sound of our kids getting up. School day morning routine beckoned. Time seems to vanish in the drama of it all, and so after I kissed my we goodbye as she headed for work, I quickly got busy making the kids’ breakfast.It was at this moment an emotion overtook me: guilt. I often feel a sense of guilt when I know others are suffering terribly. One solution could be to disconnect from it, not think about it, or even try not to care. After all, we have our own family worries and problems to sort out.But the guilt comes from the empathy I feel and I don’t want to disconnect from that. I don’t think I could stop caring evenI tried. The world needs more empathy, not less. But there is a downside to it: it can become overwhelming and even affect my mental health.Guilt in this context is such a useless emotion. It doesn’t help those who are suffering and it certainly doesn’t help the person feeling empathy. So as my guilt arrived at the breakfast table that morning, I gave it short shrt and became determined to replace it with two things.The first was to learn the lesson the blackbird had taught me moments before, to enjoy the moment and the gts around me. It put me in mind of a beautul short film of the artist David Hockney, made by Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. It’s titled The World is Beautul and he talks about the beauty around us and that when bad news is dominating our senses, the arrival of spring is good news. The important thing is to really notice the gts around us, which Hockney says he does with “intensity”.So I took up his advice and, on my walk to school with my son, I made sure I was fully present for him as he talked about monsters, Dr Who and his favourite scenes from Clash of the Titans. I savoured every moment of our connection and conversations.On myto the house, I made an extra effort to notice the beauty of spring’s arrival and other gts: the diamond-like sparkle of the dew drops on the grass, and the patterns made by the children running and playing amongst them, the dedication of George the lollipop man in keeping us all safe, the brief and faint rainbow in the sky above us, and the shimmer of the sea below the trees in bloom, and the yellow carpet of daffodils dancing in the breeze the birdsong, the smiles and greeting of people, the sense of community, the warmth of the sun the fact of being alive and having loved ones in my le.The walk was only four minutes, but when we notice the beauty and gts we have around us with the intensity that Hockney mentions, then we don’t measure with time.The second thing was to change my guilt into acts of compassion that can make a dference, no matter how small. Donate, write a letter, send a message of support, whatever. That way, empathy works for positive change for those in need.I already knew all this, but it seems I constantly need to relearn it. And that morning, the blackbird helped me to do so. His song was an awakening gt, his zig-zag hop across the soil a reminder that we should have moments when we pause to look and listen with “intensity.”Asto confirm this, he was still there on the fence when I ed home. I’d love to say he had a worm in his beak, as that would have been such a poetic ending, but he didn’t. His companion wasn’t there and he flew off as I watched him.He’d made my morning by making a positive dference in ways he will never know or understand, and not just for me."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-thousands-new-trees-planted-butterdean","story":"At the end of last month, local school groups and corporate volunteers got out their gloves, boots and shovels to help plant new trees.The trust also ran a community day on Saturday, March , that saw  people participate and help populate the wood with thousands of native trees., Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is the McCrum family of Tranent.Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" class\"editor-image\"The McCrum family of Tranent.  Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! Woodland Trust Scotland recently acquired two open fields adjacent to Butterdean Wood, thanks to support from Bank of Scotland.

Money is created by the government and the dference between government expenditure and taxes raised is added to the “National Debt” under double-entry accounting rules. It is a debt to the Bank of England which is in turn owned by government so “repayment” would simply deflate the economy.Banks create money under licence from the government. To maximise the economy there should be full employment at decent wages. If banks create insufficient money to achieve this in the private sector then government should do so by spending in the public sector.The only limit to public expenditure is from the onset of wage-driven inflation which government can address by reduced expenditure and increased taxes.Current inflation is due largely to the rise in international commodity prices. No amount of interest rate fiddling by the Bank of England can address this.There is no reason why Rishi Sunak cannot help the impending poverty and hardship for those at the bottom of the social scale. Only political dogma, economic ignorance and characteristic meanness of spirit prevents this. He did so when Covid hit so why cannot he do it again John Moreland, Killearn.COST OF LIVING WILL BE KEY FACTORREBECCA McQuillanputs forward some interesting analysis regarding voting patterns and the forthcoming local elections. The cost of living crisis is going to impact on every household in the country as she says, but it will disproportionately affect the vulnerable who include those on benefitswho received a lower-than-inflation increase from the Chancellor.Ms McQuillan mentions recent opinion polls one of the findings was that % of voters felt Finance Secretary Kate Forbes should be doing more in the midst of the crisis, sentiments I am sure Ms Forbes would agree with. However, the Scottish Parliament has no borrowing powers, its hands are tied and is dependent on Rishi Sunak – whose response to the cost of living crisis was to give every household a £ loan, to be paid back, and to reduce household council tax bills by £ per year. All very well, butyou are exempt from paying council tax, you may well be missing out on £ andyou are living in fuel poverty, paying back a loan could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.This cost of living crisis is a real one for millions of hard-working families, millions who depend on benefits and millions who have been grateful for the Scottish Government’s mitigating measures in the form of its welfare fund, which has increased massively during the pandemic. The Scottish Government has prioritised tackling child poverty, as Ms McQuillan alluded to, with the Scottish Child Payment due to more than double this year to £ a week.The cost of living will certainly be a factor in the local elections – how could it not be  Voters will have the final say and they have given a clear verdict over the last decade and half here in Scotland. At no time during this time has Scotland voted for a Conservative government at Westminster, or for that matter, a Labour or LibDem majority in Scotland, and with the present opposition in Scotland I don’t think that is about to change any time soon.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.LET DOWN BY OUR LEADERSTHINGS are not working in our country at the moment, nor have they been for several years. I agree with Kevin McKennas columnwith regards to Scotland. Boris Johnson should now not be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and those in his own sycophantic party who voted him into that very important position should hang their heads in shame.Rishi Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and others are not fit to hold the positions in which they find themselves – the former because he is currently living up to the oft-quoted phrase \"there are three kinds of lies lies, damned lies, and statistics\", and the latter because, as Lawrence Pertillar says in his poem Wishes to be Liked\", \"Nor will I ever believe one I suspect, To have a leadership position.But cannot make a decision. With kept wishes to be liked.\"I am so, so angry about the political state of our country, and indeed the world, that I spent time tracing a copy of a poem called Parable of the Talents by the American Octavia E Butler, which I wish to repeat here:\"Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be lead by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be told lies. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery\".Sadly the last sentence cannot be heard by the Russians who are living under the rule of Putin.Walter Paul, Glasgow.BUCK STOPS WITH THE VOTERSI WOULD disagree with Nicola Sturgeons mealy-mouthed acceptance of blame while tying herself in knots with the double negative – \"I didnt not say to sign the ferry contracts\" – and \"we are a collective therefore the buck stops with me\".I say this, not in her defence, but because she is simply exploiting the gullible electorate who have voted her and the SNP back into power despite her previous \"judge me on education\" Curriculum for Excellence lying in tatters, and they may vote for her again. No, the buck stops with them, not Ms Sturgeon.Fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on me. But it seems she can fool some of them all the time.Voters should remember this the next time they or a loved ones consultation or medical procedure is cancelled or comes too late, when they cannot get an appointment or procedure this side of Christmas. Many still seem unaware it is the Scottish Government that has full autonomy over the NHS in Scotland but clap like performing seals when the First Minister deflects this as the fault of a big bad posh Tory in Westminster.No, its not Ms Sturgeon the buck stops with us.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.CREDIT TO THE PM WHERE ITS DUESTEWART F Falconer , asserts that there is not one thing that Boris Johnston can be proud of.I will give off the top of my head just two examples. The first was his swt decision-making when this dreadful Covid virus first raised its head and showed it was a truly deadly danger to mankind. Whilst other countries dithered and procrastinated, especially the EU members, Mr Johnson acted by investing billions to find and secure a safe vaccine from scratch. Had he waited like everyone  who knows how many extra thousands would have died or been seriously ill and of course as a result of which, the NHS would have fallen over.The second is the leadership role the Prime Minister has taken in Ukraine in terms of sanctions and aid. It is on record that its President acknowledges the vital role undertaken by the UK Government in supplying the defensive armaments that has helped to mitigate the still-dreadful death toll being suffered by the Ukrainian people.So yes, I agree with the sentiments expressed in the letter of April  from Allan Sutherland which so upset Mr Falconer. Partygate, Wallpapergate and the rest of the gates still to be unearthed can wait their time to be answered, but in the meantime give credit where it is due to this Prime Minister.James Martin, Bearsden.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Obviously many can donate generously to charities relieving some of the suffering of the Ukrainians and some are in a position to take in refugees from that benighted country.However. Andrey Kurkov, once described as being “Ukraine’s most famous and successful living writer” who currently has a weekly slot on BBC Radio , Letter From Ukraine, when asked what we can do to help Ukraine recommends we “find out more about Ukraine. If you really want to know why this is happening read about our history”.I myself have just finished reading The Ukrainian Night: An Intimate History of Revolution by Marci Shore of Yale University. I did not find it the easiest of reads due to the plethora of Slavic names but it is well worth the effort based as it is on the personal reflections of participants in the Maidan Revolution of February . A more straightforward historical account is The Conflict in Ukraine: What Everyone Needs To Know by Professor Serhy Yekelchyk, a Ukrainian-Canadian historian of Ukrainian and Russian History.Anything  we can do  Yes indeed, write to The Herald Letters Pages with our thoughts on Ukraine.John Milne, Uddingston.WHEN WILL RUSSIANS LEARN THE TRUTH THOSE of us living in countries within Nato membership and their allies, and in fact many observers throughout the world, are looking on with horror and despair at the human misery, destruction and carnage which have occurred since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. One has to appreciate that most of what is going on there is subjected to a process of disinformation at the hands of the Russian state through its ious media outlets.One asks the question, how long can the Russian people remain unaware of the following facts: the vast numbers of Ukrainians, mostly women and children, having to leave their homes and to seek safety from attack in other countries the killing by Russian military of many civilians, including children the wanton destruction through air strikes, artillery bombardment and tank assaults of many residential areas the obstruction of humanitarian access in many areas the eradication of potential witnesses to atrocities attacks on hospitals We learn that President Putin wishes to have some kind of success to announce at the military celebrations on May . On that date Russia marks the surrender of Nazi Germany. One is left to wonder how disinformed about the despicable conduct of the Russian military forces in Ukraine the thousands attending that celebration in Moscow will be. It may not be likely to happen before May , but surely the day will come when the Russian people will be faced with the truth.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.LET THE UN OBSERVERS INAFTER reading about, and seeing television reports, on apparently-substantiated Russian war crimes in Ukraine in the areas now retaken beyond Kyiv, I dread to think what other horrors will surely follow. I have also noted that International Criminal Court prosecutors representatives are monitoring the atrocities found, so that the crimes may be veried and hopefully prosecuted at a later date. My heart, however, goes out to the residents of Mariupol in particular, who must be going through a living hell.Surely there must be some way that Russia can be made to allow UN observers in to see just what is going on in the town, especially since Russia insists that no war crimes atrocities are taking place in the whole conflict by their troops. and more help be given with safe passage to the elderly, mothers and children, out of the town to safe areas in Ukraine George Dale, Beith.NUCLEAR IS NOT THE ANSWERDAVID Bonemight be too young to remember when the South of Scotland Electricity Board planned to construct a nuclear power station at Chapledonan just two miles north of Girvan in the early s. At the time there was a huge local campaign against this proposal, which thankfully was successful.Would Mr Bone like to start a local campaign to have a nuclear power station in the Girvan area  I doubt it. In his letter he infers it is the SNP alone which is telling him there is a worldwide climate emergency. I have to ask: was Mr Bone hiding under his duvet during COP With regard to nuclear power, of which Mr Bone admits he has limited \"technical knowledge\", anyone just has to google \"Windscale\" to see why it is a really bad solution to the energy crisis the world faces.Alec Oattes, Ayr.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

We do and as his band plays suitably louche accompaniment, he turns and waggles it in the face of a smallish but enthusiastic audience.

Pictish Trail, aka Johnny Lynch, remains glorious company, whether he’s telling you of his escape from near death under the wheels or a logging truck, smacking his stomach with a tambourine, jumping into the audience for a ceilidh while his band maintain a hypnotic motorik groove onstage, or just using that wonderful voice of his to pin you to the ground.The last time I caught him in this venue Lynch was still in his Fence Records days when he was a nu-folky balladeer of sorts .And that, after a couple of technical gremlins, is how he initially presents himself here.

Like … this big.” I pulled a rolling pin out of the cutlery drawer.“Lucky! And was he generous ”This confirms all men’s worst nightmares of how women describe these occasions.The full account of the previous evening’s exertions are outrageously funny and gloriously manky.In all the spilling and leaking and splashing, though, there’s humanity and compassion as one girl struggles through shame and self-doubt to find what everyone is looking for: love and a little tenderness.“I was really touched by the messages I was getting from other women when I first started posting my blogs. They were telling me that they’d been waiting for years for someone to describe how it really is for them in real le.“There was a time when people tended to be judgmental about dating websites, as though it was for desperadoes. But it’s totally mainstream now.”I ask herit’s not fraught with a greater degree of peril for women than it is for men. Are they taking a bigger risk Several of my female friends have relayed tales of meeting blokes who think that the simple act of agreeing to go on a date is a contractual guarantee of sex.“I’ve never agreed to date someone with whom I haven’t had a prolonged period of chatting beforehand. Therefore, you can usually tell who the roasters are. Are they over-affectionate or too complimentary about the way you look “Andyou’re only agreeing to have a coffee then that sets its own boundaries.“When I was younger I was probably quite naive about all of this, but you learn from experience. I think you can get a sense of someone from the way they dress and their chatthey’re bad news.“My friends call this ‘The f***-boy vibes’.”This is one of several revelatory locutions with which Sophie acquaints me during our conversation. I strive to appear knowledgeable and seasoned about all of this and affect an insouciant man-of-the-world vibe that soon crumbles.I’m treated to some other new concepts. One of these is “dropping a pin”.Sophie explains this is a safety mechanism where her friends can electronically embed her location on their smartphones in case anything untoward unfolds.Another one is the “Tinder-walk”. This, Sophie explains, became one of the big features of Scotland in lockdown while people like me were watching old football videos and trying to decipher cookery books.Yet this Tinder-walk malarkey possesses a reassuringly vintage aesthetic. “Everyone got a dog and went on Tinder walks during lockdown,” she says. “It helped to ease us all through the social restrictions and was a way of keeping the flames of romance enkindled.”Heather Suttie, the Scottish events and PR specialist, was thrilled when she first read A Glasgow Kiss. “It just seemed to be what a lot of us had been waiting for,” she said. “I can’t remember laughing so much at a book – and crying too.“It’s just so honest and it could only have been written by a Glaswegian because it’s got that honesty and directness that’s usually missing from fiction that deals with sex and relationships.”Suttie is founder of BookFace, an international, online book club that holds monthly events in Glasgow with modern authors. “When Sophie appeared at one last month the response from women and men was overwhelmingly positive. Yes, some of the scenes are outrageously graphic, but they’re leavened with humour and honesty.”There are several astonishing aspects to A Glasgow Kiss. It’s been written by a first-time author who had not the remotest idea of how to break into the publishing world and yet has secured her a two-book deal featuring the further adventures of Zara.And as well as hitting top spot in the Erotic Fiction charts, Waterstone’s made it one of their books of the year. Yet, she’s still looking for a literary agent.Perhaps the most startling is that Sophie wrote the book while juggling the demands of being a full-time nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital during lockdown with the responsibilities of being a single mother to two children.“I didn’t really stop to think about that,” she said. “Writing the book probably helped me cope during the pandemic.”And while the majority of the responses to the book have been from women, quite a few blokes responded too.“I can honestly say that all the responses from men, including from some former internet dates, have been very positive. They all got the humour.“One messaged me last night and said: ‘F*** me, it was like reading an old scuddy mag when I was a lad. If you ever feel like ditching the halo just give me a shout and I’ll take you out’. I mean, where did he even get his hands on the book ”Any worries she may have harboured about the reactions of friends and family were ill founded.“I’d only initially told a few of them and they were all so supportive. I was a bit more anxious about my family’s reaction, to be honest.“They’re all pretty committed and traditional west of Scotland Catholics, but my mum says she’s very proud of me. She hasn’t read it and I don’t really want her to. But she knows what it’s about. And my family have also said that, of all of them, I was the one with no filters.“I recently bumped into one of my gran’s friends, a woman in her s. She waved over and said: ‘I bought your book. I sat down with it at  o’clock last week and I didn’t stop til am.’ And she’s the holiest wee woman ever.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series.

DAERA instead struck a deal with Dr Bronckaers which will involve the department admitting that the original judgment was right, and paying her a huge sum in compensation.That judgment repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues: line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey. DAERA has taken no action against either man.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to enforce the law against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals, as well as livestock movements being electronically deleted from DAERA’s much-vaunted computer system meant to track all inter-farm moves to ensure traceability of meat.Dr Huey told Dr Bronckaers that he knew the manager of Ballymena Livestock Market personally and that he also knew its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement of the law, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey.In a statement on Thursday, DAERA said it “unreservedly apologises” to Dr Bronckaers and said it had set up an “internal review” into the issue. The department also denied that Minister Edwin Poots had ever had any involvement in the case, despite being in charge of the department and despite the case having been extensively reported by this newspaper and other media outlets for months.Last month the Belfastasked the Head of the Civil Service, Jayne Brady,it was acceptable on her watch for a Stormont department to attempt to overturn a judicial finding that a civil servant was driven from her job after she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering, and whether she had any message for whistleblowers. At the time, Dr Brady said it was “not appropriate to comment on an ongoing legal issue which is a matter for DAERA”.However, now that DAERA has abandoned its appeal, Dr Brady has issued her first substantive comment on the case. In a brief statement to this newspaper, a spokesman for Dr Brady said: “As Head of the Civil Service, I unreservedly apologise to Dr Bronckaers.“This case highlights a number of signicant concerns and I welcome the internal audit being undertaken by DAERA into this matter. Work is underway on actions to improve our processes for dealing with concerns raised both internally and externally and I have asked that this is taken forward at pace and consistently across all departments.“This underlines the need to drive forward the important work we have committed to do as an employer.”Related topicsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Edwin PootsMore On \" class\"-as:\"Department of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Environmentalists take Stormont department to High Court over ‘highly damaging’ gas storage projectStormont criticised for ‘inadequate response’ after , wildfires in two years PremiumDepartment refuses to release information after Tamara Bronckaers tribunal caseStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesPlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdogMost ReadVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelBelfast paedophile brothers Gary and Gregory Rea shocked to be shunned by neighboursMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co DownPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayThe Derry Girlsjourneyand what next for the showLatest Northern IrelandAntrim manager Elaine Dowds praises players after battling defeat by WexfordWoman in s dies in Newry while waiting for an ambulance from BelfastViewpointOpinionWheel of fortune turns full circle for Portrush‘A dream come true’ … artist Jacqueline Rooney on her Jay Blades dealLosing weight  It’s a cinch!..

Once a graduate begins earning a certain amount, they start repaying these loans.Figures obtained via a Freedom of Information request show the extent of some graduates’ debts.The top five highest student loan balances of students from Northern Ireland are £, £, £, £, and £,.Figures also show that there are , graduates who have outstanding student loan balances of between £, and £,.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ellen Fearon, president of student body NUS-USI, said the figures show the “horric scale of debt our students are burdened by under the current education system”.In its FOI response, the SLC said the average loan balance for Northern Ireland borrowers is £,.“The student finance system is designed to provide funding for ious levels of study from further education, through to higher and then postgraduate, and doctoral study. The system also includes safeguards for students as it enables them to access extra years’ funding for resits,  starts and Compelling Personal Reasons where appropriate,” the company said.“Therefore these higher loan balances are not reflective of the average level of student loan debt for a student on the standard three year higher education course journey.“Customers with balances higher than the average level of student loan debt may be in receipt of several student loan products, for example loans for an undergraduate course then a postgraduate course.“Other factors which are relevant include customers who have received funding for multiple courses, customers who have received funding under multiple plan types, customers who have received additional years’ funding due to Compelling Personal Reasons, or customers who are on courses of   years in .“The iniduals concerned have received student finance in line with the statutory framework applicable to them at the time funding was awarded and paid.Ms Fearon called for an end to fees.”Higher education benefits everyone whether or not they attend university — it trains our doctors, teachers, engineers, architects, artists. Our society simply wouldn’twithout it,” she said.“Just a few decades ago people attending university got their education paid for by government, and received a grant to support them while they were there. Now there are people in this country taking on debts of over £, to receive the same education. This is unjust. Students deserve better than the failed experiment of the loan system. Abolish tuition fees.”SDLP economy spokesperson Matthew O’Toole said his party has been campaigning for the abolition of tuition fees for years.“The scale of some of these numbers are truly astonishing. It’s frightening to think more than , people here have debts of between £, and £, simply for pursuing an education,” he said.“Those figures are on the scale of a mortgage rather than any reasonable amount of educational debt.“These highlight the grim reality facing many of our young graduates here. Instead of incentivising young people to stay in education, tuition fees penalise them.“The SDLP have been consistent in advocating for the abolition of tuition fees. Education should be treated as a right, not a source of revenue.”In a further statement, the SLC said: “Student loans are income contingent, this means that repayments are based on how much they earn, not on their loan balance. Customers only repay when their  income exceeds the repayment threshold.”Related topicsMatthew O#TooleSDLPMore On Matthew OToole PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDisagreeing with another view not the same as censorship PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slursGreens urge Northern Ireland Executive to help Kilroot power station to stop using Russian coal PremiumNorthern Ireland fuel prices: Diesel has spiralled by p per litre as MLAs call for Government to actCost of living crisis: SDLP drafts emergency bill to access £m for struggling familiesMost ReadVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelBelfast paedophile brothers Gary and Gregory Rea shocked to be shunned by neighboursMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co DownPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayThe Derry Girlsjourneyand what next for the showLatest Northern IrelandAntrim manager Elaine Dowds praises players after battling defeat by WexfordWoman in s dies in Newry while waiting for an ambulance from BelfastViewpointOpinionWheel of fortune turns full circle for Portrush‘A dream come true’ … artist Jacqueline Rooney on her Jay Blades dealLosing weight  It’s a cinch!..

The SDLP is next, with % of candidates women, while a third of the UUP’s runners are female.The DUP’s South Down candidate has rejected accusations of gender bias and said the party does not run females as a tick box exercise.Diane Forsythe, who has replaced Jim Wells as the DUP’s candidate after  years at Stormont, said: “I am an accountant and mother of three young children.“I am the only DUP candidate in this constituency.“A lot of parties field female candidates in seats where they have little chance of winning or they field women as a second candidate but then ide the area in way which makes it very dficult for the female candidate to win. This shouldn’t be about tokenism. The DUP run female candidates in seats where we can win.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ms Forsythe also pointed out the fact that the DUP was the first major party to have a female leader and female First Minister.“We want to see more females in politics but it should be on merit rather not than tokenism,” she added.Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie said ensuring more women represent the party at Stormont remains a priority and that efforts will continue to increase the number of female UUP MLAs.“When I took over as leader of the UUP in May last year, I made it one of my absolute priorities to encourage more female candidates to come forward,” he said.“We have not yet reached where I want us to be — % of our Assembly candidates are female, but I desperately want this to increase at the next Assembly elections.“They may have been selected, but the most important thing now is getting them elected alongside their male colleagues, so that we have a base to build on for the future.“We are on a journey and I want to bring about further change as we head towards next year`s council elections and every election after that.”Mr Beattie said he wants the make-up of his party to “reflect society”.He continued: “Diversity and inclusion can only increase the strength of any organisation. We need more role models and I hope that the exceptional candidates we are standing at this election will be future leaders in our party and society.“We are not yet there yet, but I am absolutely committed to taking us in the right direction.”Connie Egan, who is running for the Alliance Party in North Down, welcomed the gender make-up of her party’s candidates which she said had happened without a quota being set. However, she said more needs to be done to tackle sexism faced by female candidates: “We each have a role to play in ensuring we continue to encourage more women to participate.”Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartySDLPAlliance PartyNorthern Ireland AssemblyJim WellsDoug BeattieMore On Democratic Unionist PartyUnionists snub group which aims to improve cross-community relationsConstituency guide: Who will top the poll in Northern Ireland Assembly election and whose seat is at risk  How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victories PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerScare tactics: Beattie accuses DUP of ‘whipping up hysteria over border poll’Most ReadVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelBelfast paedophile brothers Gary and Gregory Rea shocked to be shunned by neighboursMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadDecoratordenies that he ripped off almost  pensionersTop VideosPlayFootage of an attack on police in Killough Co DownPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayThe Derry Girlsjourneyand what next for the showLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Constituency guide: Who will top the poll in Northern Ireland Assembly election and whose seat is at risk  How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victoriesAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerScare tactics: Beattie accuses DUP of ‘whipping up hysteria over border poll’Sam McBrideOpinionAll is not yet lost for the DUP in tactical battle to beat Sinn FéinLatestAntrim manager Elaine Dowds praises players after battling defeat by WexfordWoman in s dies in Newry while waiting for an ambulance from BelfastContinued imprisonment of Julian Assange ‘a criminal act’, says weCelebrity line-up announced for second series of Cooking With The StarsLouisa Harland: Derry Girls script set the world on fire,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway which will be cut down through the steep shore bank and will involve reinforced piling.Once completed the station will be ready to take delivery of the new leboat, which will be named the Bryant and Eleanor Girling after a generous RNLI benefactor.SAINTFIELD mdash Three workmen and two police officers required hospital treatment after a chemical spill in Saintfield last week.Four  gallon drums containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,.

Is he taking the figures from those who responded to a consultation Is it surveys  I am wary of surveys that often ask leading questions and produce findings which purport to show support for particular policies.We should follow a UK-wide human rights bill and ignore lobbying from a range of voices on the issue.Some of the people who talk most relentlessly about right are Sinn Fein IRA politicians, who defend the rights abusers who engaged in republican violence. Although the ECHR is apart from the EU, I believe that the majority of those who voted for Brexit also wanted to leave the ECHR. We have seen some of the crazy decisions that have been taken in the past like convicted foreign criminals who have impregnated a woman and have used it to avoid deportation, claiming a right to family le. How many terrorists have taken cases to ECHR to bypass UK rulings  Northern Ireland should be linked completely to UK courts that should be able to overrule the European Court of Human Rights, which interprets the ECHR. The UK has some of the most liberal human rights laws in the world. We see all the time people bypassing other European Union countries just to get to the tolerant UK, to take advantage of British decency.John Mulholland, DoaghEditorial April : London should not exclude Northern Ireland in the needed retreat from ‘rights’ lawsLetter April : People want Northern Ireland to have rights protections, as should this paper"},{"url":null,"title":"rory mcilroy does northern ireland proud again and shows the value of perseverance with his near masters win ","story":"Multicultural blaze: ‘Just because it’s seen as a UVF area doesn’t mean they did it’ says Billy Hutchinson   Emotive funeral service for road tragedy victim Lee UsherNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionRory McIlroy does Northern Ireland proud again and shows the value of perseverance with his near Masters winNews Letter editorial on Monday April  :By EditorialMonday, th April , : amUpdated Monday, th April , : am  \"       \"  News Letter editorialRory McIlroy, from Holywood in Co Down, is one of the best golfers in the history of the game.He has held the number one ranking, something that few people can claim, but much more than that, he has won three of the four majors.Rory was aged a mere  when he became one of the youngest ever major winners, with his victory at the US Open.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

And then that same year, he collected the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.It was a truly astonishing tally for a sportsman who was then still only aged . It also cemented Northern Ireland as a golfing superpower — not only home to numerous fine golf clubs including two of the best in the world, Royal Portrush and Royal Co Down, but also to three recent major winners, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke as well as Rory. England, a country with  times the population of NI, has never had three major golfing winners in such a limited period of time. If Rory McIlroy’s career had come to an end in , it would still have been a glittering one.But we have all been hoping that he can go a step further, and win the one major title that has so far eluded him — the prestigious Masters at Augusta. That would be a truly astonishing feat, and put him up in a select group of currently only five players, including the greatest names in the history of the sport — Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.Rory almost did it yesterday, coming second at the Masters to the US golfer Scottie Scheffler. But what an achievement! Rory has been one of the few players to challenge American dominance of the majors in the last decade.His second place yesterday comes after years in which he rarely seemed to be within reach of the very top.Rory is a testament to dedication and perseverance, an inspiration to young people, and a fine ambassador for Northern Ireland.See the back page"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry and meghan markle watch how the royal romance blossomed in a new documentary with expert analysis ","story":"Paying hospital bills and higher taxes trump desire for Irish unity: Survey   There is ‘no evidence’ that Irish speakers are ‘marginalised second-class citizens’ says former education ministerNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeoplePrince Harry and Meghan Markle: watch how the Royal romance blossomed in a new documentary, with expert analysisPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s story has been one of the most talked about romances of the st Century.By Bill Smith, Latest TVFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  How did it start  Where did their love bloom  Who were the original Duke and Duchess of Sussex  With exclusive footage, this is the full story of their love covering what happened on the night they met their engagement, the royal wedding, and the challenges they faced as they searched for a home.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLewis Hamilton defied the FIA’s clampdown as he competed with piercings in both ears and a nose stud at the Australian Grand Prix – and said afterwards that he has no plans to remove them in future outings.Wittich was hired by the FIA following Michael Masi’s dismissal for breaking the rules at last season’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix – an event which denied Hamilton a record eighth championship.“How he has run the first few races has been respectful, solid and he hasn’t put a single foot wrong,” Mercedes team principal Wolff said of Wittich in an interview with the PA news agency. vw,vw,px, px\"Toto Wolff does not believe jewellery is an important issue “But is that [jewellery ban] a battle he needs to have at this stage “However,it turns out to be the biggest unfortunate misstep of a race director, I would take it a thousand times over.”On Tuesday, it will be four months since Max Verstappen beat Hamilton to the title. But Masi’s incorrect handling of the affair remains a sore topic for Wolff.The Austrian’s mind turns to the days before the most contentious finale in F history.He continued: “It is quite interesting because I had lunch with him [Masi] on the Wednesday before the race, and I said to him that ‘I really want to tell you, without patronising you, that you need to take criticism on board and develop from there. Lewis does it every day, but you are guy who always seems to know better’.“It wasn’t about influencing him but really giving my honest feedback that he shouldn’t block outside opinion as simply being wrong.“You hear from the drivers and how the drivers’ briefings were conducted [by Masi] and some of the guys said it was almost disrespectful how he treated some of them.“There is a promoter of one of the races in the Middle East who said he was so relieved he had gone because he got so much abuse from him..remove“He was just immune to any feedback and even today he has not properly reflected that he did something wrong.“He was a liability for the sport because everybody kept talking about Abu Dhabi and the race director, and the race director should not be somebody that people talk about, but someone who does the job and makes sure the race is run according to the regulations.”Hamilton, who finished fourth in Melbourne, is expected to be at Mercedes’ Brackley factory between now and the next race in Imola on April  as the Silver Arrows play catch-up with rivals’ Ferrari and Red Bull.Smiles on a Sunday 😃😁 pic DvUxXKhV— Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F TeamApril , Hamilton is fth in the standings,  points behind runaway leader Charles Leclerc, and nine points adrt of new team-mate George Russell.The -year-old has finished ahead of Hamilton at two of the opening three races and is second in the standings.Hamilton and Russell appear to be bonding and went surfing together ahead of the Australian Grand Prix.Askedhe was surprised how well the two Britons are getting on, Wolff replied: “Yes because they are both so competitive whilst still being able to work together.“The effort they are putting into showing respect – from the young kid to the best ever and from Lewis in appreciating the future talent that is in George – is impressive.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Toto Wolff questions new race boss as Lewis Hamilton defies jewellery ban article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in . By , its numbers were less than half those recorded in , it came in at  in the rankings this year, seen in just % of gardens.Throughout the first half of the spring term the nation’s school children took part in the RSPB’s Big Schools Birdwatch.

Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Three homes ransacked while occupants were out   Toome road tragedy: woman dies after crash and man is arrestedNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

Stephen, Sharon and their children.“Sharon is born and raised in west Belfast and has been battling a horrible cancer diagnosis for over two years now. We have two kids and she has been an absolute inspiration.“The doctors and nurses have went above and beyond helping her and us as a family in every way imaginable.“We could not support the NHS staff more and are so thankful for everything they have done and continue to do. “With the line in the song ‘I can see in your eyes, the strength to survive’, this sums up Sharon to me. She will never give up any battle and that gets us all through.”The Newtownabbey man, who has been performing for over  years, is full of praise for the team who helped him record his song.He stated: “I find the writing process very simple.  minutes maximum would be a song for me. The recording side can take a little longer. Around three studio sessions completed the song and then mixing and mastering after. “I recorded it with Jorge Sloan at Half Bap Recording Studios in the city. It was then mixed by the great singer songwriter Joel Harkin. We had another great musician from Carnmoney also on the record, Adam McGahan. He really added so much to the drive of it. Mark Evison added a beautul poem to kick the song off, something that isn’t done too much in singles, but I think it drags the listener in and sets the tone perfectly.”Since the video for the song was uploaded to social media, Stephen was been encouraged by the feedback, adding: “There has been some great feedback from the video. All the comments and shares have been greatly appreciated and they give me a little more drive to keep at it and to never give up.”The -year-old businessman, who runs a cafe in Belfast, is due to marry Sharon later this month .Commenting on being able to balance his wedding preparations with his music career, he said: “We are just over two weeks away from our wedding on April . “It’s a stressful time, but through all of the stress there is such a great feeling of love and admiration.

DfI Roads has recommended a number of planning conditions. A new “puffin” crossing is to be installed near the junction.A report to councillors stated: “It would be dficult to find a more appropriate location within Ballymena.” It also says that it is “reasonable to assume that such a facility will promote more sustainable travel rather than create additional congestion. “The facility has the potential to ease congestion both in Ballymena and at other provincial hubs.“The existing Park and Ride facility in Ballymena is outdated and regularly cannot accommodate all who wish to use it. The proposed facility will solve this problem and ease local congestion.It is also noted that no objections have been received from neighbours and “the use of intelligent lighting, CCTV and high quality landscaping will ensure that the proposed facility is a good neighbour”.Larne Lough Alliance Councillor Robert Logan commented thatbus services from outlying villages and towns were better co-oordinated with trains, it would not be necessary to have “such a large facility”.Translink said that when Park and Ride facilities are being established, they are “future-proofed” to provide flexibility for extra spaces when they are required.“Looking at increased bus services and co-ordinating is something that we do on a regular basis. On this particular line, we are looking at increased capacity and frequency of trains as well as some very important local improvements,” said Mr Stott.He noted that an upgrade of the level crossing at Cullybackey has been commissioned by December.Committee Chair Ballymena councillor Alderman Audrey Wales said: “Anyone who has tried to use Ballymena Park and Ride will know how necessary it is.She also quipped: “For somebody who uses the Park and Ride regularly and finds is dficult to get a parking space, please hurry up and get it built.”Bannside DUP Councillor Tom Gordon said: “This is a much-needed facility here in Ballymena. The existing Park and Ride is much too small. It is over capacity. It is a great project. It is as close to the railway station as possible and makes it very convenient for motorists.”Cllr Gordon said that he welcomed the application and that he was happy to propose the planners’ recommendation for approval. His proposal was seconded by Bannside TUV councillor Alderman Stewart McDonald.A Translink spokesperson said: “The enhanced Park and Ride at Ballymena Bus and Rail Centre has received planning approval from Mid and East Antrim Council.“The extension to our Park and Ride will provide more than  additional spaces. The project will include accessible parking and cycle parking, with access on Galgorm Road.“We anticipate the project being completed in the first quarter of .”Read Retro: Ballymena pictures from the past"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures larne music festival returns after two year absence ","story":"Man was ‘too drunk’ to pay for botte of vodka, court told    pictures from Lurgan anti-protocol parade and rallyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleThe committee of Larne Music Festival has thanked all who supported and attended this year.

The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex. The fun park has chosen the charity as its partner - a thoughtful gesture given the important work volunteers do in the waters off the north coast.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series. Sponsored by Moy Park, ‘Rare Breed – A Farming Year’ continues on Tuesday th April at pm on UTV.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abcbfefafeecffa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ceeadaafafcdedaaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
