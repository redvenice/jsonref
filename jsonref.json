First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project. But the state\u0027s highest court torpedoed his efforts, refusing even to hear the case.Still undeterred, Hadid\u0027s lawyers filed a second appeal - this time against Judge Karlan\u0027s decision to appoint a receiver to oversee destruction of the house. He lost that appeal as well.Last month, Hadid\u0027s legal team filed a third appeal, this one against the $2.9 million judgment awarded to the neighbors by the civil trial jury."},{"url":null,"title":"Cowboys pay 4 cheerleaders 2 4M voyeur claims","story":"Share this articleCowboys paid $2.4 million to settle cheerleaders\u0027 voyeurism allegations against senior team executive"},{"url":null,"title":"Health minister admits Government KNEW links Tory peer PPE firm given 200m","story":"Share this articleMinister admits he knew Michelle Mone\u0027s links to firm that got £200m VIP-lane PPE deal - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"As teachers new rules wokeism Britains wokest schools revealed","story":"Share this articleShare this article Regarding historical figures \u0027with contested legacies\u0027, the instruction is to focus on what they are \u0027most renowned for\u0027 and provide \u0027factual information\u0027 if children are too young to understand the complexities of the issue.For older pupils, both sides of an argument are to be presented, the guidance adds.When discussing elections, teachers can consider issues but must not lead pupils to a particular \u0027conclusion\u0027.\u0027As a general principle, they should avoid expressing their own political views to pupils unless they are confident this will not amount to promoting that view,\u0027 the guidance says.\u0027Where staff do share their personal political views, they should ensure this is not presented as fact and note there are opposing views.\u0027Mr Zahawi said: \u0027I am reinforcing that no subject is off limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.\u0027The guidance applies to all schools, including academies and independent schools, but not early years settings, 16-19 academies, further education colleges or universities.Dr Mary Bousted, of the National Education Union, criticised the move, saying: \u0027Very good guidance already exists and this is followed up and down the country.\u0027Educators take their responsibilities for teaching in these areas seriously and carry it out with considerable thought.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrew relatively CHIPPER relieved","story":"Share this articleShare this article   \u0027Obviously that (a ban on Mrs Giuffre saying anything) was something that they could have put in the agreement and they haven\u0027t, and so it implies that there\u0027s a lot she (Mrs Giuffre) wants to say that Andrew will not want to hear.\u0027The settlement, which was agreed between lawyers in a sensational development yesterday, comes just weeks after Andrew vowed to contest the rape claims by Mrs Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, at a public trial.Mrs Giuffre had alleged she was forced to have sex with the duke three times when she was 17 under the orders of the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Only last month, she was given the go-ahead to sue Andrew for unspecified damages in a New York civil court.

Photograph: Alan Betson More than 460 reports of menstrual disturbances in women who received a Covid-19 vaccine have been submitted to the State’s medicines regulator. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) said 94 of these related to missing periods and 365 to heavier menstrual bleeding. “In the vast majority of cases, reports were received directly from a vaccinated woman describing a menstrual disturbance with no associated medical condition,” the regulator said in its latest update on vaccine safety.Latest investigations by the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) suggest there may be “short-lived changes” in menstrual patterns, including absence of menstrual bleeding and heavier-than-usual menstrual bleeding following mRNA vaccination, the HPRA said.“This further assessment is part of routine ongoing safety monitoring, and the EMA has stated that, at this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal link between the Covid-19 vaccines and reports of changes in menstrual patterns. There is also no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines affect fertility.”The EMA has also reviewed studies of 65,000 pregnancies and found the data “reassuring”.“The review found no sign of increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriages, preterm births or adverse effects in the unborn babies following mRNA Covid-19 vaccination.”Suspected side-effectsMore than 1,000 reports of suspected side-effects following either a third or booster dose of Covid-19 have been received by the authority.By February 8th, 1,077 reports of suspected side-effects had been received following the administration of 2.7 million third – or booster – doses, according to its latest safety update.About one in every 2,250 children who has so far received a Covid-19 vaccine has reported a suspected side-effect, the update shows.A total of 346 reports of suspected side-effects in young people have been made after administration of the Pfizer vaccine. This related to the delivery of 780,000 doses to under-18s up to February 8th.A total of 54 of the reports related to a child – general vaccination of five to 11 year olds began last month – and the rest related to adolescents aged 12-17.Overall, the authority says, the reports received are consistent with the types of reports received for adults, with most being mild to moderate in nature. Many had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting, it said.Weakness and chest painThe most commonly reported side-effect among children (325 reports) was “general symptoms and local reactions” such as tiredness, weakness, chest pain and feeling hot. Other significant categories were nervous system issues such dizziness, headache, fainting or feeling faint (237) and gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain (142).Overall, the HPRA has received a total of 19,468 reports of side-effects, relating to about 10.5 million administered vaccines and boosters – equivalent to one report for every 540 doses.About 40 per cent of suspected side-effects had resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting. It has received 120 reports of myocarditispericarditis and 10 reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)There have been 14 reports of anaphalaxis following a PfizerModerna vaccine and a “small number” after AstraZenecaJanssen.In 106 reports, the person was vaccinated and subsequently died. The median age of this group was 81 years.“Reports describing a death are carefully reviewed. However, it can be expected that fatalities due to progression of underlying disease or natural causes will continue to occur, including following vaccination.

No time and date has been set for the next meeting. One source at the meeting said the impression they got was: “We’re done.” A move to a more normalised approach, out of the emergency stance that gave rise to Nphet, is now seen as highly likely by multiple sources. This would entail the disease being managed without the input of a body comprised of outside experts such as Nphet, and instead being managed through existing structures. But the final decision rests with Mr Donnelly.The meeting also agreed a significant shake up to testing and masking in the country. Under a new masking regime, masks will only be needed in healthcare settings, and the advice to mask on public transport, in retail settings and in schools will lapse. The advice will be finalised in a letter to Mr Donnelly. The regulation-based approach to mask-wearing will no longer be in place, sources said. However, it will still be seen as important, and people will be encouraged to wear masks if they feel more comfortable in so doing - especially on public transport, which is a crowded setting that people cannot avoid. The meeting also agreed to issue new advice to Government that would radically change the testing system for Covid-19. It is understood testing will be focused on the over 55s, those who are are vulnerable, and those who live with someone in those categories. Otherwise, the advice will be for people to self-isolate if they are sick with Covid symptoms until they have abated. Close contacts will not need to seek a PCR test. It is thought that unvaccinated and unboosted people will still be advised to seek a test. The changes to masking and testing have been advised to come into place at the end of February.It is expected that the Government will accept the advice.Meanwhile, the Department of Health said they have been another 5,035 positive cases of Covid-19 confirmed by PCR testing in Ireland. In addition, a further 4,406 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.

It will be very variable from place to place,” she said.Powerful storm“It’s going to be a powerful storm zipping across Ireland, giving very strong winds absolutely everywhere. It will be a short-lived affair, but really very serious conditions countrywide.”She said it was not anticipated the status-orange snow warning would be extended to other counties.Claire Quane, network operations manager at ESB Networks, said the utility has put its emergency response plans in place. She added that safety is of “critical importance” and members of the public should stay away from overhead powerlines that have fallen down.The local government sector said it is prepared and ready to respond to the weather event, with each local authority having sufficient salt to grit roads. The civil defence is also on standby to assist, should the need arise.The Road Safety Authority has called on those in red-warning areas to avoid all travel, those in orange-warning counties to consider postponing their journeys until the storm has abated and those in yellow-areas to take significant caution while travelling.In Northern Ireland, the UK Met Office issued a status yellow snow warning for Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry from 3am until 6pm on Friday, and a yellow wind warning for Antrim, Down and Derry from 7am until 6pm on Friday.A rare red weather warning – the highest alert, meaning a high impact is very likely – has been issued by the Met Office for parts of southern Wales and southern England due to the combination of high tides, strong winds and storm surge expected.A status red marine warning is also in place off the coast of the south of Ireland, with winds forecast to reach storm force 10 or violent storm force 11.The storm is the second to hit the country this week, after storm Dudley brought strong winds of up to 100 kmh on Wednesday.

The great French mathematician Henri Poincaré, a brilliant expositor of the scientific method, described how he grappled for months with an arcane problem in function theory. Exasperated by lack of progress, he went on holidays and forgot about the problem. But, as he was boarding a bus, the answer came to him in a flash. He was later able to return to his office and complete a proof of the result.This is characteristic of the sudden spurts of progress that often occur. New mathematical ideas do not arise according to some pre-determined plan they seem to pop up in random fashion, but this invariably happens following sustained efforts and deep thought, which lay the groundwork for discovery.Some mathematicians keep regular and limited working hours. The renowned English mathematician GH Hardy began his research after breakfast each day, working until 1pm. Then he would have lunch and head for the cricket ground. But, of course, progress was not confined to the four morning hours. The intense conscious mental effort triggered unconscious activity, with sudden insights breaking through at any time, day or night.Where do the ideas come from?Ideas come from a multitude of sources, but the researcher needs time to think about them, follow up hunches and explore various options. No holds are barred at this stage and intuition is given free rein. A mathematician may have a feeling that a certain result is valid but cannot prove it. Intuition is a valuable guide, but it can also mislead us to believe what appears obvious but is false. For this reason, mathematicians insist on a cast-iron proof, understandable to their colleagues and removing all doubt. A result does not become a theorem until the conditions for its validity are established and it is shown to follow logically from these conditions. In the past, most research was done by mathematicians working alone. They might maintain contact with colleagues and attend meetings and conferences, but published papers usually had a single author. This is no longer the case: today, most papers have two or more authors and collaborative work is the norm. Where does it all happen?The conventional notion is that research is carried out at an office desk or in a library. A mathematical idea may arise at a meeting, a seminar, or a conference. There are also research centres dedicated to mathematics: INI in Cambridge, IHP in Paris, MFO in Oberwolfach, IMA in Minnesota and many more, where mathematicians gather for a week or two to work together.Walking provides a great opportunity for thinking and many researchers have written about how their best ideas came to them during a ramble. René Descartes did his mathematical thinking while still in bed in the morning. The Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan was inspired by Mahalakshmi of Namakkal, a family Goddess when, as he slept, complex mathematical results unfolded before his eyes. American topologist Stephen Smale used to do his research on the beach in Rio de Janeiro, and André Weil proved one of his most famous results, the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, while in prison. Other likely places for inspiration are on a train or plane, in a café or church, at a concert or in dreamland.

Photograph: Aris MessinisAFP via Getty ImagesKyiv and Moscow blamed each other for clashes in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Thursday as western officials continued to question Russia’s claims it had withdrawn troops from close to Ukraine’s border.The Ukrainian army said “Russian occupation forces” controlling breakaway far-eastern regions of Ukraine in the Donbas had “with special cynicism” shelled a kindergarten in a village in the Luhansk region, injuring two civilians. It later said shelling was occurring in more than 20 separate locations in eastern Ukraine as unconfirmed videos including the sound of live fire appeared on social media.Russia – which backs separatists in the Donbas but denies, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that it is a party to the conflict there – blamed Ukraine for the escalation. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin, said the shelling “was a subject of very, very deep concern”.“We have warned many times that Ukraine’s excessive concentration of its armed forces next to the line of contact, along with the possibility of provocations, could be highly dangerous. And now we can see these provocations are happening,” Mr Peskov told reporters.The flare-up was the latest in a smouldering conflict that has claimed about 14,000 lives in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk since erupting in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.A statement posted on the website of Donetsk-based Russia-backed separatists said: “The situation on the line of contact has escalated significantly over the past few hours.”‘False flag’US president Joe Biden has said his “sense” is that Russia will invade Ukraine within the next several days.Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a visit to Cleveland, he said the prospect of a Russian attack on Ukraine was “very high”. He said Russia could engage in a “false flag” operation as an excuse to “go in” to Ukraine.Asked if he believed a diplomatic resolution was still possible, Mr Biden said: “Yes.” He said he had no plans to call Mr Putin and he had not yet seen a response by Russia to security proposals made by the US. Mr Biden ordered US secretary of state Antony Blinken to change his travel plans at the last minute to speak at a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Thursday. Mr Blinken told the council that Russia planned to manufacture a pretext for an invasion in coming days. “This could be a violent event that Russia will bring on Ukraine, or an outrageous accusation that Russia will level against the Ukrainian government,” Mr Blinken said. “It could be a fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave, a staged drone strike against civilians, or a fake – even a real – attack using chemical weapons. Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing, or a genocide.”The US state department said on Thursday Russia ordered the deputy chief of mission to the US embassy in Moscow, Bart Gorman, to leave the country, calling the move “unprovoked” and “an escalatory step”. Russia provided no details of why he was expelled.Rebutting claimsThe increased fighting in Donbas comes as the US, UK and Nato continued to rebut Russia’s claims this week that it was pulling back some of its forces from the border with Ukraine and in Crimea as well as Donbas.The White House late on Wednesday called the Kremlin’s claims that it is withdrawing forces from the Ukrainian border “false” and accused Russia of increasing its troop presence in the region by about 7,000 in recent days.The Thursday flare-up has also raised fears that Mr Putin – who has massed more than 150,000 troops around Ukraine – could use it as a pretext to invade the country. The US and UK have repeatedly warned that Moscow could orchestrate a “false flag” operation to justify a deeper incursion into Ukraine.“Russia’s claim of genocide in Ukraine is a reprehensible falsehood,” the US mission to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said in an overnight tweet, referring to a claim this week by Mr Putin that Kyiv was conducting a “genocide” in Donbas.The OSCE’s special monitoring mission in Ukraine “has complete access to the government-controlled areas of Ukraine and has never reported anything remotely resembling Russia’s claims”, the mission added. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Additional reporting: ReutersAPStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"neutrality does not require relinquishing our capacity for self defence","story":"The mass build-up of troops by Russia on Ukraine’s borders and implied threat of invasion in recent weeks brought clarity to Europe’s security situation.It has also made clear some understandings and misconceptions in Ireland about defence.You’ve reached an article that is only available to  subscribers.Subscribe today and get the full picture for just €1 for the first month."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hms queen elizabeth inside aircraft carrier royal navy flagship","story":"The yellow-helmeted flight deck officer leans into a 40-knot wind and raises a small green flag in his right hand. I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsLiz Truss, real friend of Ukraine, offers steadfast support amid the love bombs and dad jokesPost Office scandal victims cleared in court \u0026#39should be allowed to sue\u0026#39Prince Andrew will not be interviewed by the FBI over Epstein connectionMore lost footpaths to be saved after \u0026#39race against time\u0026#39 to find missing walkways avertedWhitehall using video calls to vet recruits for ‘top secret’ security rolesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"benedict cumberbatch questions netflix short cinema run oscar","story":"Benedict Cumberbatch has questioned Netflix executives over his Oscar-nominated film’s limited run in cinemas.Cumberbatch stars in Netflix’s award season favourite The Power Of the Dog, and is thought to be working with the streaming service again on an upcoming Roald Dahl adaption, but has nevertheless questioned the company’s policies.Although Netflix is predominantly a streaming platform, the British star has taken aim at executives over a two-week cinematic run allotted for The Power of the Dog, which has allowed the film to qualify for the Oscars it is now predicted to dominate.Cumberbatch, nominated for a Best Actor award for his portrayal of a closeted rancher in the film, has asked executives: “Could you not afford to have a longer theatrical release?”Speaking to Vanity Fair, the actor addressed his question to Netflix’s head of original films Scott Stuber, the company’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos, and “everyone who runs Netflix”.His comments come following rumours he is set to play Sugar in Wes Anderson’s adaptation of Dahl stories The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar - another Netflix production.Netflix is thought to have more than 220 million subscribers worldwide, and its production of original, big-budget films has been seen by some as posing a threat to traditional cinemas by allowing viewers to see big releases at home.The streaming giant has however offered short cinematic releases for its productions, which has allowed critically-acclaimed productions like Roma to fit the criteria for the Oscars, which stipulate that films must be shown on the big screen.Multi-award-winning director Steven Spielberg has insisted in the past that Netflix makes films that “are just given token qualifications in a couple of theatres for less than a week”, and that they “deserve an Emmy (TV award), but not an Oscar”.Cannes has also taken a hard line on Netflix by barring its productions from the annual film festival because they do not have a French theatrical release.Weighing into rumbling industry debates, Cumberbatch has said that he is in a position to critique contemporary issues in cinema, saying: “If I’m in the belly of the beast, then surely I can start asking questions of it.”However, the star has conceded that he doesn’t know whether The Power of the Dog could have run in cinemas for longer.He told Vanity Fair: “I don’t know. I’m positioning this as a question publicly… I haven’t actually had this conversation with them (Netflix executives), but I would and I will.”Cumberbatch, who rose to fame for his leading role in BBC series Sherlock, is tipped for Oscars glory in Jane Campion\u0027s artistic piece The Power of the Dog, but has also enjoyed box-office success in the popular Marvel franchise as Doctor Strange.Along with asking questions of Netflix, he has commented on the influence of Marvel in the world of cinema, saying that without the pull of stars from superhero franchises “financing any film” is difficult.He added that this was true “no matter how important the story, no matter how urgent the story, no matter how talented and awarded and appreciated the artist is”, and has asked himself whether he is “working for the Goliath that’s killing the David”.While Doctor Strange has not swept the Oscars, The Power of the Dog has earned 12 Academy Award nominations ahead of the 2022 ceremony, including for best picture, best director, and best-adapted screenplay.Despite criticism from some in the film industry, Netflix productions have performed well at the Oscars, with awards going to original titles including Mank, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, American Factory, and Marriage Story.Martin Scorsese’s mobster epic The Irishman was also nominated for a slew of awards in 2020.Netflix has been contacted for comment.The Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue is available via digital download and on newsstands on Friday, 25 FebruaryMore from NewsLiz Truss, real friend of Ukraine, offers steadfast support amid the love bombs and dad jokesPost Office scandal victims cleared in court \u0026#39should be allowed to sue\u0026#39Prince Andrew will not be interviewed by the FBI over Epstein connectionMore lost footpaths to be saved after \u0026#39race against time\u0026#39 to find missing walkways avertedWhitehall using video calls to vet recruits for ‘top secret’ security rolesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris make nick clegg one powerful men britain","story":"When they first stood together in the Rose Garden of Downing Street, few would have guessed where David Cameron and Nick Clegg would ultimately end up. The former prime minister has slipped into obscurity: mocked, ignored and having virtually no place in public debate. But his erstwhile deputy is now enthroned in Silicon Valley as global affairs chief of Facebook. He’s one of the most powerful men in the world – and I wish that was an exaggeration.Murdoch, Hearst, Beaverbrook: none exercised as much power over the world’s news as Clegg is now capable of doing. After the broadcasters, Facebook is Britain’s number one source of news. Its users may think they’re just seeing what they selected – based on who they follow, what they share. But what they actually get is a selection, chosen by algorithms under criteria programmed by Silicon Valley workers. All overseen by the likes of Clegg. In this way, Facebook can edit the way tens of millions see the world.The power that all this gives to Silicon Valley is matched only by the utter ignorance in government about its nature and implications. And that’s why Boris Johnson is unwittingly about to give Clegg – and all the Big Tech firms – more power than ever. In a cackhanded attempt to bring them all to heel, the Online Safety Bill will transform Big Tech into our new censors. They’ll obey government orders on a certain number of things, but in return they get the power – nay, duty – to police the rest pretty much as they see fit.The original idea is sensible: to tackle pornography, criminality, content encouraging suicide: in other words, genuine online filth. But how to do this in a country with free speech rules? The Online Safety Bill invents a new category – “legal, but harmful” – with fines imposed on any digital publisher that crosses this vaguely drawn line. The danger, of course, lies in the grey areas. What about articles questioning vaccine policy – are they “harmful”? Or Jimmy Carr’s gypsy jokes? Facebook won’t want to be fined or take the risk. The bots will be told: if in doubt, strike it out.Consequences can be seen already, with government critics first going digitally missing. The Socialist Workers Party found its Facebook page vapourised. Novara Media, an upstart socialist broadcaster, had its YouTube page taken down. In both cases, services were resumed after an uproar over-zealous censorship bots were blamed. But this draws attention to something we were never really told: that such bots already are at work, trawling cyberspace, identifying troublemakers and closing them down.Clegg has never cared much about free speech. As deputy prime minister, he tried to force newspapers to submit to government regulation, but his job now is to maximise Facebook’s profits. It makes money by showing adverts, with “likes”, “shares” and Baby Shark videos: unlike the media moguls, Silicon Valley doesn’t care about news. It has no interest in defending minority voices. Its general approach is: we’ll do anything, just don’t fine us! In fact, we can be your censors! Look how well we’d do it!The Covid era saw Silicon Valley demonstrating just how effective a censor it can be. Facebook boasted that it was “working with government” to combat “misinformation” – which it seemed to define as stories unhelpful to No 10. As a viewer, you won’t miss what you don’t see. But editors like me (even The Spectator swims in a digital sea) soon find out which articles the censor bots dislike. For example, if our weekly YouTube show had criticism of lockdown policy, that episode might have mysteriously fewer viewers – probably because it’s withheld from YouTube’s all-powerful recommendation system. But we’re never told. Sometimes, an episode is deleted entirely.Articles, too, are judged harshly. During the debate about face masks, I commissioned an in-depth report from two academics, both experts in their field: they found the evidence unconvincing. The bots hated it and Facebook slapped a “false information” warning on it. I asked Facebook to identify a single error in the article. No response. It’s Facebook: it doesn’t have to respond. I wish I could say it doesn’t matter, but social media drives about a third of our website traffic (and, ergo, our sales). So yes, it matters.The British Medical Journal watched all this, thinking (rightly, as it turned out) that it would be next. In an editorial, it highlighted the risk this posed to basic scientific debate. “It seems 2020 is Orwell’s 1984, where the boundaries of public discourse are governed by multibillion dollar corporations (in place of a totalitarian regime),” it wrote. “And secret algorithms coded by unidentified employees.” Except we know the identity of one of the bosses: Sir Nick Clegg. And he’s about to be the new Big Brother. Quite a thought.Clegg himself is unlikely to delete Boris Johnson’s account (as Twitter did to Donald Trump) but Facebook could, if it wanted. This raises a question: should he have so much power? More to the point, should Clegg’s colleagues in San Francisco be deciding what Brits should be reading? Why can’t we see the criteria, or the decisions? Might we end up with the Left-wards bias, seen time and time again in social media in America?Reports of Covid leaking from a Wuhan lab were once seen, by Facebook, as fake news – and removed. Now they look all too plausible. The nature, power and influence of censorship bots is something that politicians struggle to imagine, let alone regulate. The BBC presents an easier, juicer, more understandable target. When the Online Safety Bill was introduced in Parliament, not a single MP asked about bots or speech protection. “My colleagues can’t see that this Bill would make us more exposed than ever to the wokeward drift of Silicon Valley,” says one minister. “It may soon be too late”.Boris Johnson has been pressing “pause” on a few policies of late, and the Online Safety Bill is the biggest disaster waiting to happen. In the four years that this Bill has been in the making, it has been rendered out of date because the dynamics of digital media and public debate have changed so much. If he goes ahead now, it would cement Clegg’s status as the most powerful Englishman in world media. There’s still time to stop, take stock and think of a better way.More from NewsLiz Truss, real friend of Ukraine, offers steadfast support amid the love bombs and dad jokesPost Office scandal victims cleared in court \u0026#39should be allowed to sue\u0026#39Prince Andrew will not be interviewed by the FBI over Epstein connectionMore lost footpaths to be saved after \u0026#39race against time\u0026#39 to find missing walkways avertedWhitehall using video calls to vet recruits for ‘top secret’ security rolesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"disney fans can now live fun forever theme park giant builds","story":"If you\u0027ve ever been to Disneyland and felt like you never want to leave, now you don\u0027t have to.The theme park giant is creating its own town where residents can “live the next chapter of their lives” amid the spirit that infuses the “Happiest Place on Earth”.Disney “Imagineers”, who create the magical effects at its parks, have designed a community that will be staffed by cast members and centred around a 24-acre turquoise lagoon.It will have 1,900 homes on 618 acres and feature a neighbourhood for senior Disney fans aged over 55.The new town, called Cotino, will be built on a desert site in the Coachella Valley near Rancho Mirage, California.The location was chosen because Walt Disney once lived in the area.It will be the first of several towns planned in the Magic Kingdom\u0027s new venture called “Storyliving by Disney”.Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said living in Cotino would mean “you can be part of Disney all of the time” and the town would have “core Disney DNA”.He said: “There is incredible demand for all things Disney. Our fans continue to look for new ways to engage with us, to keep Disney as part of their lives.“We can’t wait to welcome residents to these beautiful and unique Disney communities where they can live their lives to the fullest.“Every single element of these communities will be steeped in a story.”Michael Hundgen, an executive producer with Walt Disney Imagineering, said: “An Imagineer\u0027s story is at the heart of everything we do, and we love bringing authentic places to life to immerse you in those stories.”In addition to theme parks, Disney already runs a cruise line with ships on which passengers are immersed in a world where characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck roam the decks.The new town - which Disney calls a “masterplan residential community” - will not feature roaming characters, but Disney said its cast members would deliver “world-class service, and of course, fun”.Residents will be able to buy an estate, a single-family home, or a condominium, for which prices have not yet been announced.There will also be a beach club and park, a town centre with shops, restaurants and entertainment venues, and a 400-room hotel for visiting members of the public.It is not Disney’s first venture into residential communities. In 1996 it launched the community of Celebration, Florida near Walt Disney World.And in 2011 it founded Golden Oak, Florida, a luxury community where home prices started at $1.6 million (£1.1 million).Creating residential communities was a goal of Walt Disney, who died in 1966. Towards the end of his life, he envisioned a new city called Epcot - “Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow”.He wanted it to be a “showcase to the world of the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise”.The town\u0027s name “Cotino” is derived from “cotinus” which means smoke tree.It is a reference to the name of Walt Disney’s former home in the area, Smoke Tree Ranch.Mr Hundgen said: “There is an incredible natural beauty in the Coachella Valley landscape. You can see why Walt Disney used to escape to the desert to dream the impossible.“He treated the area like his creative oasis. We’d love our residents to treat this as their creative oasis.”The local mayor has called Cotino the “largest project in the history” of Rancho Mirage.Disney said it wanted to “go beyond parks” and “find new ways to make magic”.It said the town would have the “special Disney touch” and be “infused with Disney placemaking”.There were few details of what that meant but it will involve “wellness programming”, live performances, cooking classes, and “philanthropic endeavours”.Helen Pak, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products executive, said: “Picture an energetic community with the warmth and charm of a small town and the beauty of a resort.“A place that entices inspiration, and makes every moment more memorable than the last.”More from NewsLiz Truss, real friend of Ukraine, offers steadfast support amid the love bombs and dad jokesPost Office scandal victims cleared in court \u0026#39should be allowed to sue\u0026#39Prince Andrew will not be interviewed by the FBI over Epstein connectionMore lost footpaths to be saved after \u0026#39race against time\u0026#39 to find missing walkways avertedWhitehall using video calls to vet recruits for ‘top secret’ security rolesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour party trying just little hard","story":"First we had Keir Starmer, arch Remainer-in-Chief, the man who single-handedly reversed his own party’s commitment to respecting the outcome of the 2016 referendum, dismissing any suggestion that there might be a case for Britain rejoining the EU.Now his deputy, Angela Rayner, has suggested the police could “shoot terrorists and ask questions later”. In an interview carried on Matt Forde’s excellent political podcast, she channels her inner Tony Blair by coming down heavily on the side of ordinary people against thugs, advocating a radical harassment approach by the police: “I want you to beat down the door of the criminals and sort them out and antagonise them. That\u0027s what I say to my local police – three o\u0027clock in the morning and antagonise them.”It\u0027s all very refreshing, New Labour circa 1995 stuff. But there’s something implausible about it all. When Blair, as Shadow Home Secretary, coined the phrase “Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime”, it seemed very much in tune with what we knew of the man’s political philosophy at the time: impatient with the bleeding heart lefty liberals who had repeatedly driven the party over a cliff edge in their pursuit of “progressive” policies, only to alienate the same working class voters they had learned about at university.His subsequent initiatives, such as on-the-spot fines for anti-social behaviour and anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos), addressed local communities’ priorities without bothering too much with the chattering classes’ concerns for civil liberties. The same concerns they talked about endlessly at dinner parties in their nice, expensive homes in areas that weren’t subject to loutish behaviour.Rayner, having been brought up in a council estate and in relative poverty, is exactly the kind of politician who would normally be best placed to champion such an approach, all the alternatives having miserably failed to protect ordinary, decent, working people from the excesses of vandalism and harassment. But there’s a problem. There is a giant elephant in the room, and it answers to the name of Jeremy.For she was one of Corbyn’s most loyal lieutenants, having stepped up to serve in the shadow cabinet when everyone else resigned in protest at his leadership in June 2016. We must assume that she was one of the 40 loyalist MPs who supported him (as opposed to one of the 172 who opposed him) in that month’s vote of confidence.Is she really asking us to believe that these recently-expressed opinions are her real ones – opinions which she has kept secret these past few years and only now can be expressed sincerely?Quite aside from the (relatively unimportant) party politics aspect, there is the far more serious issue of civil liberties, which even Blair took more seriously than Rayner. The obvious example is that of Jean Charles de Menezes, the innocent Brazilian man shot and killed by anti-terrorist officers of the Met in 2005, supposedly on the basis that he looked a bit dodgy. That, it could be said, was an example of shooting now and asking questions later.If Rayner simply meant to endorse current police policy of shooting actual terrorists who are rampaging through the streets attacking civilians, then that’s something we can all get behind. But in that case her views perhaps need a touch of polish, an element of nuance, before they’re revealed to the wider world.The problem for Rayner and her party is that she may very well be expressing views that she has held for some time they may be sincerely held and thought through. Given her upbringing, it is entirely possible that she genuinely recognises the need to apply a tougher approach to community policing and to stop seeing assailants, vandals and general ne’er-do-wells as “victims” too.But in agreeing to serve a man who believed none of these things, in portraying herself as a hard-Left tribune of the people in whom Corbyn and his followers could place their trust, she threw away the chance to be listened to once that leader was no longer in post. She, together with Barry Gardiner, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Richard Burgon and many others, accepted fast-track promotion to the shadow cabinet when the opportunity presented itself (a sort of assisted places scheme for politicians), squandering any chance the party had to rid itself of Corbyn and his voter-repellent views.Perhaps we should be more patient with those who seek to reinvent themselves in office. Tony Benn did it, after all, albeit travelling in the opposite political direction to Rayner. But a consequence of that is that the public reserve the right to view her and her newfound orthodoxy with a degree of scepticism. If she plays her cards right, Angela Rayner has a long career ahead of her. She will need much of that time to convince others that this time, at last, she is being sincere.In the meantime, don’t expect Starmer, the former human rights lawyer and Director of Public Prosecutions, to appoint her as Shadow Home Secretary.More from NewsLiz Truss, real friend of Ukraine, offers steadfast support amid the love bombs and dad jokesPost Office scandal victims cleared in court \u0026#39should be allowed to sue\u0026#39Prince Andrew will not be interviewed by the FBI over Epstein connectionMore lost footpaths to be saved after \u0026#39race against time\u0026#39 to find missing walkways avertedWhitehall using video calls to vet recruits for ‘top secret’ security rolesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers alone cannot address complexities race","story":"‘Show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become,” said the celebrated author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the dangers of providing a single interpretation of the experiences of a particular group. Her words came to mind when I heard the recent news of young children being taught that they are not “racially innocent” by some teachers following the narrative set out for them by Black Lives Matter campaigners.Race is a complicated subject, and how children are taught about it matters deeply – especially in this period of heightened, sometimes hysterical, “culture wars”.Many will therefore have been cheered by the announcement that the Government plans to forbid teachers from promoting Black Lives Matter to children as part of a crackdown on politics in the classroom. New guidance from the Department for Education says that discussions about “contentious and disputed” topics, such as the British Empire, must be held in a balanced manner.However, schools are already required to teach in an impartial way under the Education Act of 1996. Issuing new guidance may well do some good, but there is a danger that this announcement alone will not go the whole way to solving the problem. We must do more to understand why it is that damaging and politicised narratives are being taught to children in the classroom.Our schools are not filled by uniformly far-Left teachers who are determined to indoctrinate young minds with radical new ideologies. Teachers are, however, unequipped to address some of the complex subjects – including the legacy of empire – that children rightly want to learn about.One of the problems is that, when teachers look for resources on which to base their lesson plans, the only material that is readily available online is produced by Black Lives Matter-style organisations.They can easily find PowerPoints and worksheets about the pervasiveness of white privilege. Yet there are very few websites to draw from that provide a holistic view on the complexities of race. To the uninformed, quite radical views on race and empire can appear mainstream.That is a vacuum that needs to be filled with an infrastructure of resources, based on the input of the wider community, and which captures the views of those black people who are less radical than race scholars. They exist, believe me, and deserve a much greater voice.Some organisations, such as the Equiano Project, are attempting to do just that, but they will need money and support from the Government to have a major impact. This is a slower but more strategic course of action.We need to work with teachers, many of whom have been hurled into the culture wars without a choice. They face a Herculean task in explaining the complexities of history or debates about race, so we should make it easier for them to understand – and then to teach – different viewpoints, including the views of black people who do not hold extreme opinions about issues such as slavery and race.It will take more than new Government guidance to achieve this in the classroom – and much more to achieve it in society as a whole.More from NewsLiz Truss, real friend of Ukraine, offers steadfast support amid the love bombs and dad jokesPost Office scandal victims cleared in court \u0026#39should be allowed to sue\u0026#39Prince Andrew will not be interviewed by the FBI over Epstein connectionMore lost footpaths to be saved after \u0026#39race against time\u0026#39 to find missing walkways avertedWhitehall using video calls to vet recruits for ‘top secret’ security rolesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp universal credit sanctions soar","story":"Exclusive: DWP Universal Credit sanctions soar to , a month in extremely worrying riseThe number of sanctions has shot from a few thousand a month to , - a similar proportion to before the pandemic - after the DWP brought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments.

The shocking rise comes as millions of people are hit by rising living costs, with energy bills, National Insurance and inflation all surging this Spring while benefits rise by only .%.Sanctions were suspended in the first Covid lockdown, and remained low at first after being restored in summer . But they have soared since the Department for Work and Pensionsbrought back face-to-face Jobcentre appointments last April, with people who miss a session having their benefits cut or stopped.The number of Universal Credit claimants with a sanction rose from , in June  to , in November , the most recent month available. Scroll down for the full figures and join the debate in the comments. Have you received an unfair sanction  Tell us on webnews@mirror. The total number of people sanctioned across the whole month will be higher than the official figures, as they are taken on a particular day each month. The data also excludes Universal Credit claimants who are not in ‘conditionality’ groups, such as severely disabled people.And Tory ministers are now introducing even tighter rules, with claimants facing a sanction after four weeksthey refuse a job outside their chosen field, which could push sanctions higher. Anti-austerity activist Charlotte Hughes warned it was “extremely worrying as we face a huge cost of living crisis putting energy and food prices up”.  She added: “Sanctions are a cruel and unnecessary tool to use against those that are already poor and living in poverty. “Benefit sanctions ensure a person or a family are dragged further into poverty, making them have to choose whether they can eat or heat for the duration of their sanction.“Sanctioning claimants creates a never ending circle of poverty and does not encourage anyone to look for more work.” Dr David Webster of the University of Glasgow, who has researched the impact of sanctions for years, said: “The impact of a sanction often lasts a long time. “If it causes a crisis in the family, orit leads to somebody being evicted, the effects are pretty long-lasting. “Sanctions drive people further into debt, because obviously people can’t stop spending money altogether – they have to find something to eat and so on. “They have to keep spending money, somoney isn’t coming in they’re going to have to borrow it, and they get further in debt. “That has damaging effects on their mental health, because there’s all the anxiety and stress. And for a minority of people there’s obviously the question of potential eviction.”  The sharp rise comes even as the overall number of Universal Credit claimants has fallen with the reopening of the economy. DWP figures this week show .% of claimants were subject to a sanction in November, a similar proportion to before the pandemic. That is up from .% in October and .% in September. “If you look at the trend, there’s really virtually no slackening in the pace of increase in that percentage – it’s heading skywards,” said Dr Webster. The DWP’s recently announced Way to Work scheme will soon force claimants to look for jobs outside their chosen field after just four weeks on Universal Credit. A DWP spokesperson said: “With a record number of jobs available, it’s right that people who can work are encouraged to take up suitable roles through our Way to Work scheme. As well as being good for mental wellbeing, people are at least £, better off in full time work than on benefits. “People are only sanctionedthey fail, without good reason, to meet the conditions which they agreed to, and the latest data shows the sanctions rate remains below pre-pandemic levels.”Sanctions by month Figure is the number of people on the Universal Credit full service receiving a sanction on the second Thursday of each month.

The Lib Dems have tabled an Early Day Motion to release “all accompanying evidence” on gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall, “including photographs”.Top civil servant Sue Gray gathered around  images and passed them to police, who are investigating  Westminster parties during lockdown. However, sources have said she is not set to publish the images, which it’s thought could include CCTV stills, when she produces a second report. And this week it emerged the Cabinet Office Liaison Unit has asked the Met Police to confirm it will not publish photos either, as part of its investigation. The Lib Dem motion would use the mechanism of a “humble address” to order a “full, unreacted report of the Cabinet Office” investigation to be published.  The government would also have to give “a full list of the names of any elected officials, senior civil servants, and political appointees” who are fined by police.This comes after the police and government suggested anyone who is fined will not be named, with Brits having to rely on Boris Johnson naming himself.But it is only an Early Day Motion designed to voice opinions on issues of the day, without a House of Commons debate. Tory ministers are under no obligation to give it any debating time, let alone a formal vote, on the floor of Parliament.And it’s understood Labour is not ordering its MPs to sign the motion.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey urged MPs to back the motion regardless. He said: “Boris Johnson can’t be trusted to admit whether he or any other Conservative ministers end up being fined by the police. “We’ve seen time and again that his instinct is to lie, blame others or cover up the truth.” No staff feared publishing the damning pictures could harm their reputations, according to the Times. The Mirror has learned one photo shows Boris Johnson holding a bottle of beer at his own birthday party and was taken by his official photographer.Boris Johnson has until tomorrow night tohis Met Police Partygate questionnaire. The Prime Minister was issued with the quiz last Friday - and given seven days to send back the completed form.  He has been consulting lawyers over his responses - and is expected to resist any attempts to oust himhe is slapped with a fine.London mayor Sadiq Khan said it would be inappropriate for him to lean on police and ask them to release photos of the Downing Street parties.He told LBC: Just think how inappropriate it would be for me, a Labour Mayor, getting involved in operational matters where a Conservative politician is being investigated. There are some countries around the world where the police do have their arms twisted in relation to operational issues. I think it is right in our system where I have got no influence in relation to whether the police do investigate Boris Johnson, what is published and so forth. I have always, as the Mayor, been cognisant of the importance of me understanding which side of the line I should be on. Mr Johnson has already admitted attending some of the  gatherings under investigation - including  minutes at a birthday party in his honour, where a photo showed him holding a beer.But according toITVpolitical editor Robert Peston, the PM’s lawyers now believe the relevant test is whether he ed to “proper work” after the gatherings.Well-connected Mr Peston wrote: “If he can prove that he didnapost get drunk and incapacitated, and has proof that he resumed more conventional prime ministerial activities after the seeming parties, his legal advisors seem to think there is a chance he can prove said events were simply part of his working day. “Andhe got sozzled and went for a kip, heaposd be fined.” Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister who analyses Covid lockdown laws, said the argument about whether the PM went back to work afterwards is “irrelevant”. He told the Mirror: “It doesn’t matter what he did before or afterwards - the question is did he participate, andhe spent  minutes at a birthday gathering and there is a photo of him carrying a bottle of beer then he participated. “If someone was working in a building in central London and in the next room there was a rave, and they just popped into the rave for  minutes, it would be absurd to say they had a reasonable excuse. “There is no technical defence of ‘I went back to work’ - there is no technical defence of ‘I didn’t get drunk’. “’I held the beer, I didn’t get drunk’ is like Bill Clinton’s ‘I smoked marijuana but I didn’t inhale’ - it’s nonsense. I don’t understand that to be a defence which could work in the regulations.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Sophia Scott was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome in  after her parents Darren,  and Amanda, , noticed dferences in her development. The rare genetic condition is a type of childhood dementia which also causes fatal brain damage.Sadly the average le expectancy for children suffering from the disease is between  to -years-old, but most donapost survive their teenage years. Darren, from Glasgow, has opened up about the heartbreaking reality of his daughteraposs condition and said watching her suffer is aposshatteringapos. He said her diagnosis came like a bolt of lightening as Sophia, who was previously fit and healthy, began to have dficulties with her speech and reading. Speaking to the Daily Record, Darren said: This has destroyed all of us. It turned our le upside down.Not a day, not a minute, goes by that it doesnapost flash through your head the sadness of it. We want to give Sophia the best le possible, eventhat is just things like taking Sophia on once in a letime trips. But it is hard trying to squeeze as much as possible into such a short time. It is obviously a very dficult and upsetting le. Darren Amanda have some very dficult medial decisions to make for their daughteraposs future and have to choose whether or not she will undergo potentially le-threatening surgery.  Her diagnosis came after a referral to speech therapy from the youngsteraposs nursery which eventually uncovered her terminal illness, also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis type III . As Sophiaaposs condition has progressed, her spine has curved which is now impacting her internal organs. Surgeons would like to do a major operation to fuse metal rods into her back, but the procedure does not come without its risks. The youngster previously had spinal surgery but the emotional impact of the decision was extremely dficult for the family. Darren said: It is a horrendous experience to have to live with and be a part of, especially with some of the decisions we have had to make recently.  When we went through the surgery with her a few years ago, it took everything out of us. These are decisions you donapost want to be thinking about for your child - never mind your child with a lower le expectancy than other children. Sophia is also now struggling to keep weight on and will most likely need another operation to insert a feeding tube. Despite the heartbreaking reality of the familyaposs situation, Darren and Amanda focus on short term goals so they can give Sophia a happy and positive le. Darren said: Watching Sophie become non-verbal and watching the condition take away all the things she has learnt is hard. But she is an absolute bundle of energy and joy. She is very bubbly and has crazy blonde hair with big blue eyes and an infectious smile.  The two things she loves the most are adventures and people. We wonapost give up on her. There is no cure yet, but there is research going on. Awareness is the only hope we have. For the past three years Darren and Amanda have launched a birthday fundraiser for Sophia with some cash going towards making memories and the rest being donated to medical research and charity. This year money will go towards aposfighting the incurable and progressive illnessapos as a donation will also be made to Sophiaaposs fantastic school Kelburn Park Primary. Sanfilippo Syndrome is a rare genetic metabolism disorder which leads to serious problems in the brain and nervous system.  The condition often goes undetected until early childhood as most donapost have symptoms until they are between two and six-years-old. Early symptoms of the condition include recurring ear or sinus infections, speech and development delays, persistent nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, hearing loss and diarrhoea. Appearance can also be affected with some children having coarse facial features, thick eyebrows and a large head. Behavioural issues are also linked to the condition with some children being hyperactive, impulsive and dficult to cooperate with. Symptoms are similar to that of people with autism.

But five weeks after being placed in the coma, the close-knit family were only able to visit him when medics called to say he was not going to make it. Jodie and mum Kate - who was married to Mr Louza for almost  years - went to the Covid ward, donning HAZMAT suits and helmets to say their final goodbyes. Her two heartbroken brothers stayed behind after becoming terried they would end up catching Covid for the first time. Jodie, a receptionist, said: They couldnapost understand why it affected him in the way that it did. They were hoping they could wake him up.  We couldnapost hold him and be normal. It was heartbreaking, really hard to digest. I was stubborn, I kept telling myself he will keep fighting. He was a fighter and a very strong man. I had never seen him ill before. He was very into his health and fitness. He was very humble. He was very fit. He had looked the same since he was , he did not age. It was such a shock. He was brilliant with his advice, he was loved. We would always have family game nights and he was really competitive and didn’t like to lose. He was an inspiration. I still canapost really comprehend it. It’s nearly been a year and I still donapost understand it. Jodie added the family are unsure where he contracted Covid, as he strictly followed the rules. It could have been something as simple as someone in the supermarket passing him. He really deteriorated rapidly, she added.Just three days after Mr Louza died, the devastated family received an NHS letter saying he was now eligible for the vaccine.Jodie added: It was unimaginable. I was very worried about Covid. I had a lot of people in my age bracket saying it wouldnapost be that bad. It’s the worst thing in the world. Unless you have been through this, it’s hard to realise how dficult it is. He didnapost have the funeral he should have had, it was really controlled and not what we would have wanted. Jodie is now planning on running the Carver Wolverhampton Half Marathon in April in memory of her cherished dad. She has already raised more than £ for The National Covid Memorial Wall - a London-based mural honouring those lost during the pandemic. She said: I think he would be proud. I would like to think he would be at the finish line. I needed something to motivate me, to work towards. I think it’s easy to get lost in grief. It makes me feel better knowing I am doing something in his memory and knowing it’s going to benefit other people because I know we are not the only ones who have been through this.To donate to the familyaposs fundraiser, visit Jodieaposs GoFundMe.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ruby Cropper was crossing the road with a friend to play in Coronation Park in Radclfe, Greater Manchester, when she was catapulted  feet along the road by Andrew Cairns. Cairns, , had been weaving in and out of traffic and overtaking on the wrong side of the road before his Suzuki Alto ploughed into young Ruby at a speed estimated to be not less than mph.Manchester Crown Court heard that Cairns, who had previous driving-related convictions, left Ruby dying in the road and sped off, reports Manchester Evening News.Jamie Baxter, prosecuting, outlined what happened on August ,  at around .pm. He said: “Instead of waiting and pulling over, or calling an ambulance or asking for help, the defendant chose to drove away. “The force of the collision propelled her forwards  metresfrom the point of impact, where she came to rest on the opposite side of the carriageway near to a bus stop.  “Notwithstanding the efforts of decent members of the public, some sat with Ruby as she lay in the road, and efforts of well trained and dedicated ambulance service and medical professionals, she passed away in the early hours of August .” Crash experts concluded thatCairns had been driving to the mph limit, he would not have hit Ruby. The court heard Rubyaposs mum and older brother rushed to the scene, which was  yards from their family home, to hold her hand as she lay injured. She was airlted to hospital and her le support machine was turned off after two days with family at her bedside after doctors concluded her injuries were not survivable. One eyewitness who had been overtaken by Cairns moments before he crashed into Ruby, said he had been ‘driving like a looney’. Otherssaid they thought Cairns had been ‘driving super fast’ and ‘like he was on a racetrack’.  Cairns, who gave himself up shortly after, admitted causing death by careless driving on August , . But he was convicted unanimously by a jury of the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial in January and was sentenced on Thursday. Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Smith jailed Cairns for five years and gave him a seven-year driving ban. In emotional victim impact statements read to the court, Ruby’s brother Ryan Veitch, mum Shelley Booth and dad Ian Cropper each spoke of the terrible grief they have endured since Rubyaposs death. The sight of seeing her unconscious and dying in front of me is the worst thing I have ever had to deal with, Rubyaposs heartbroken mum said. She added: We lay with her and played her favourite music, took her hand and footprints, told her how much we loved her and were there until her last breath.  Mr Cropper spoke of his unbearable pain, adding: She made me happy when I was sad. She was my everything and itaposs hard to put into words the loss I feel. I will never heal from this. I will never recover from this. Judge Smith told the defendant he had an arrogant entitlement to drive at excessive speed. He added: This is a tragic reminder for all those who drive,speed limits are not observed the car we are driving can be a lethal weapon. The court heard Cairns had two previous convictions for drink-driving, including crashing and flipping his dadaposs Honda Civic and leaving the scene. Six months after the crash involving Ruby, Cairns was caught speeding at mph on the M. Rubyaposs family said she had become a le-saver through organ donation to three other people after her death and £, had been raised for North West Air Ambulance.

Elaina Serghi, , has written heartbreaking notes to her young children to read after her death - but believes things could have been very dferent. Her family has turned to crowdfunding in the hope of accessing private treatment that can ensure she is there for children Leo, six, and Christina, three, for as long as possible. Latest figures show cancer treatment times have reached a record high as the government faces calls to deal with the huge backlog. Elaina, from Manchester, told The Mirror she had to wait for two months for a colonoscopy after falling ill in early , and an operation to remove a tumour was put back by more than a week.She was too ill to begin immediate chemotherapy after surgery and learned late last year that the disease, which started in her colon, had spread to her lungs and stomach. Elaina said: I want to be around for as long as I can, at my age I shouldnapost be writing notes for my kids to readI die, itaposs heartbreaking. I genuinely think it could have been dferent or at least not as bad. Elaina is among thousands who have turned to crowdfunding in the hope of extending her le, with more than £, raised toward private treatment after the disease spread. She said: Itaposs spread to my stomach now, Iaposm just hoping that new drugs will give me a bit longer with my family, thataposs all I can ask.  Itaposs really bad, cancer patients are being neglected. Itaposs not fair what weaposve gone through, Iaposve got two young children who need me.Elainaaposs family have launched a GoFundMe appeal to help pay for private healthcare and drugs to prolong her le.So far more than £, has been raised to support her. The moving appeal, set up by cousin Ana Papathomas, states: Heartbreaklingly, the chance to continue this fight has been taken from her. The only treatment which offers hope is not available on the NHS. It can only be obtained privately. Elainaaposs only way to keep fighting is to seek funding for this treatment. As you can imagine, this is not cheap and while it didnapost come easy for Elaina to take this decision and reach out for help, her single-minded desire to survive, to live, has left her with no other choice. Campaigners have called on the Government to prioritise dealing with the UKaposs huge cancer backlog, with more and more forced to turn to crowdfunding as the disease progressed. An estimated , people with suspected cancer will have to wait longer than two weeks to see an oncologist this year, Government analysis showed.And it is expected that more than , will not start treatment within the  or  day targets set by hospitals. Craig Russell, whose daughter Kelly Smith died aged just  in June  after her treatment was paused at the start of the pandemic, said more and more people are having to turn to crowdfunding.Craig, who set up the Catch up on Cancer campaign following Kellyaposs death, said: Iaposve heard far too many stories, there are lots of loved ones who have lost ones avoidably. Everyone is arguing about who is driving the fire engine, but the house is still burning down.He said the governmentaposs target to bring waiting times to pre-pandemic levels by next year simply isnapost good enough. Theyaposre saying itaposll take  months to get back to mediocrity, thataposs not the way we should be dealing with cancer patients, he said. He is haunted by the possibility that mum-of-one Kelly, from Macclesfield, could have lived longerher appointments had not stopped. There are questions over whether something could have been done, that makes it impossible to reconcile, Craig, , said. That question - have we been cheated out of six months, six years,  years - you just donapost know. The thought of other people going through this is heartbreaking. Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said after figures were published last week: We know this will be having a devastating impact on many people with cancer who are experiencing agonising delays and risk a worse prognosis.In a statement the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Cancer diagnosis and treatment remains a top priority. The pandemic has put enormous pressures on the NHS, causing waiting lists to grow, but now most cancer services are back to or above pre-pandemic levels.“Our record investment in the NHS includes an extra £bn this year and £bn over the next three years to cut waiting times, including through delivering an extra  million checks, scans and operations, making sure more patients get the treatment they need sooner. “Last week the health and social care secretary declared a national war on cancer, with the launch of a call for evidence to inform a new -year plan to improve cancer care, speed up diagnosis and invest in innovative new treatments.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The snap could be spotted in pictures released yesterday that showed her holding an in-person audience with military officials at Windsor Castle.The audience took place in the castleaposs Oak Room, Her Majestyaposs private sitting room, and the lovely framed photo could be seen on a table behind her. Itaposs unclear where exactly the photo was taken - but it appears to have been at her Scottish Highlands retreat of Balmoral. In it, the Queen can be seen sitting on a sofa surrounded by nine of her younger relatives. Standing behind the sofa and posing for the camera appears to be her granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor, beside her great-grandchildren Prince George, Isla Phillips, Princess Charlotte and Savannah Phillips. Meanwhile sitting beside her on the sofa appear to be Prince Louis, Mia Tindall and Lena Tindall. Therefore itaposs likely the baby she is cradling on her knee is Lucas Tindall, who was born last March. Missing from the snap are the Queenaposs other great-grandchildren - Prince Harryaposs children Archie, Lilibet, August Brooksbank and Sienna Mapelli Mozzi.

In footage of her audience, the monarch can be heard remarking loudly: “Oh. I’m here! I thought you might have just stayed in there for ages. Good morning.” Asked how she is, the smiling Queen, wearing a floral dress and holding a walking stick, points to her left leg or foot and responds: “Well as you can see I can’t move.” She is understood to have been feeling slightly stf, rather than having injured herself or being unwell. Later in the footage, Rear Admiral James Macleod remarks: “Well, many congratulations on the start of your Jubilee year”, with the Queen saying: “Oh thank you very much indeed.” Major General Eldon Millar adds: “She gave a little growl as we came in.” The Queen replies: “Oh really …she doesn’t normally growl.” Rear Admiral Macleod replies: “She obviously can see through us.”Yesterdayaposs audience was also the Queenaposs first in-person appearance since her Covid scare a week ago, suggesting she may have escaped the virus despite coming into contact with Prince Charles, who tested positive two days later.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

The furiously private couple, who were married for  years, would remain professional in public settings or during royal engagements, so it was rare to see any sort of affection. But a royal insider has shared an insight into what went on behind the scenes.

In  he was awarded a Royal Warrant as dressmaker for his work.  The Queen is always perfectly dressed and her use of block colours and pretty pattern has worked for decades. But the same couldnapost be said for all the royals, as during the programme, one of the experts described Sarah Ferguson as the worst dresser of all time. Ingrid said: “The worst dresser of all time was definitely Fergie. She looked great in her own clothes, in jeans and t-shirts but she was just a disaster in the fashion of the s because it was just too much for her. It was too frilly, there were too many bows. She said so herself.” However, as sheaposs got older, Fergie learnt what suits her, and what doesnapost Emily Andrews said. She said: As an older woman now she has got her style absolutely on point. She’s got really good legs, she always wears dresses or pleated skirts, a top and a blazer and she’s got that lovely red hair.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Oliver Monaghan-White, , had completed his basic training as a navy sailor and had been preparing to become a chef on one of the Royal Navyaposs stealth nuclear submarines. He had been forced to go through computer-based training which he didnapost enjoy and during this time he had continued to rack up more than £, in gambling debts, the inquest in Winchester heard. Abigail Askwith, his partner told the inquest that Oliver had volunteered to go into submarines because of the extra pay he would have received and this, combined with his dficulty accepting authority, had made him unhappy. She said: Oliveraposs personality and who Oliver is does not line up with the Royal Navy and having people telling him what to do just annoyed him. He did not like to be told what to do, even with me. It was just who he was, he was stubborn. Oliver signed up for submarines when he first went into the Navy for money reasons and nothing . He realised that submarines would not be the best option considering how he struggled to be away from home. He wanted to be in the Royal Navy to see the world, in submarines you donapost see the world. He only signed up for the money. Hampshire Coroner Jason Pegg heard how Oliver, who was repeatedly described as a closed book emotionally, had been sent to the base at Worthy Down, near Winchester, Hampshire, to complete his Phase  training but that he had struggled with disciplinary issues.The aspiring chef had struggled with his attitude and adjusting to naval le but there were no outward signs of him being unhappy, the hearing was told. However, Abigail said Oliver, who lived in Darlington, County Durham, had expressed deep unhappiness and even said that he had tried to get himself thrown out of the Navy by acting up. Through tears, she said told the inquest: There was always a dferent reason why he wanted to moan about work. In March  before he came home I nearly got him to leave. He did have reasons to leave, he was still using inhalers which he should not have been. He was almost on the point of leaving but then he pulled back because he didnapost want to let anyone down. I said aposyou are not letting anyone down, you have tried it, you are not letting anyone downapos but he was worried that he would let his family down. Oliver would often say in a joking manner that he would kill himself, the inquest heard. However, those close to him did not take it seriously because of his dark sense of humour. The inquest that Oliver had accumulated large gambling debts and despite multiple loans from friends and family, he was not able to get on top of them.  His family also told the hearing that Oliver had continued to pay maintenance for his daughter from a previous relationship. However, he was struggling to get access to her and was considering legal action to assert his rights. The coroner was told that Oliver had been at his family home on May , , on leave, only days before his death and had been emotional about leaving. Abigail said: I packed his suitcase on Sunday morning -I donapost do things they donapost get done properly. He was sat on the bed and looked at me and said aposthis will be the last time you are going to see me.apos I thought he was just winding me up because I get upset when he goes back to the base, I thought nothing of it. I took the case downstairs and put it by the front door. Nicole was making us some sandwiches and I started talking to her. Then I noticed Oliver put something into the case, I asked what it was and he said it was nothing. But since we have been through and checked the cupboards and I believe what he put in the case was what he had used [the rope]. The couple had spoken on the phone the evening before he died as Abigail told the inquest that nothing seemed amiss and that she thought he was better than ever. After hanging up the phone, she sent Oliver a message saying: Goodnight, I love you. The message was never opened. On the morning of June , , Oliver was found by staff at the Worthy Down barracks hanged. The inquest heard that Oliver had been alone on his floor after he had been removed from his original class for disciplinary reasons.

A toxicological examination found no drugs or alcohol in his system. Oliveraposs isional officer Chief Petty Officer Thomas Dennison told the inquest he was a talented chef who the Navy felt would have offered a great deal to the service. Warrant Officer Ian McHugh told the coroner that had Oliver expressed his wish to leave the submarine service it would have been considered, but it would have been dficult because chefs were considered critical. The veteran sailor added that Oliver had committed to serving five years in the Royal Navy, something which his family believed might have made him feel trapped. Concluding the inquest Mr Pegg said: Oliver was a young man who rarely spoke about his feeling and he has been described as often being a closed book. When he started training at Worthy Down Oliver said he was not enjoying the Royal Navy but in a subsequent conversation he said he wanted to say in and give it a go. It is clear Oliver gave the impression of wanting to give it a go. He worked hard on his course and he had a good attitude. I am satisfied that when Olive place the lanyard around his neck he intended the outcome to be his death. Therefore the appropriate conclusion is suicide. Oliver took his own le and he intended to do so. Why he did what he did only Oliver will know. It seems to me that Oliver was a closed book and was a young man who seems to me to have had a bright future in the Royal Navy. He had a number of pressures, most signicant was the financial debts and the pressure associated with his former relationship and his child. *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The aircraft was spotted trying to land at Dublin Airport on Wednesday during Storm Dudley, with the plane skidding along the tarmac as it tried to get its wheels down. The pilot eventually managed to safely land the plane, but there were a number of similar incidents reported around the country as mph winds made taking off and landing dficult. On one Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Cork Airport, the pilot took three attempts to safely land the aircraft.On the second attempt, people were screaming as the plane was just meters off the ground, and then had to suddenly take off away from the runway again, reports CorkBeo. One passenger on board the flight, who hadnapost flown since before the pandemic, said that the plane was extremely shaky and that tensions started to get high as the pilot approached the airport for the second time.  We got so close to the ground and then suddenly started heading up into the air again, people were screaming, it was worrying at the time, the passenger said. We ended up back out over the sea and then on the third attempt we did actually land, but it was scary for a minute there, once the plane landed one person was sick as soon as they got off the flight, they added.The tricky weather conditions affected a number of flights on Wednesday. The strong gusts forced the plane carrying Manchester City aposs players and staff to ert to Liverpool after leaving Lisbon, with the aircraft forced to circle the airport a number of times before landing.Millions of Brits endured a fretful night as huge gusts of around mph battered parts of the UK, with amber warnings in place for central Scotland, Northern Ireland and in England.  Gusts of up to mph swept the Midlands as Storm Dudley blew across the country, leaving thousands without power in northern areas. Commuters looking to get to work this morning woke to find roads blocked by felled trees as well as nightmares of train lines as workers try to remove the devastation. People on social media shared pictures of damaged homes, crushed cars and power cuts. In the north of England, around , were left without power with thousands still waiting for the lights to be turned on.  A red weather warning - the highest alert, meaning a high impact is very likely - has been issued by the Met Office due to the combination of high tides, strong winds and storm surge.Forecasters said there is a risk of flying debris resulting in danger to le and damage to buildings and homes, with roofs blown off and power lines brought down. The warning covers the coastline of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset as well as the south coast of Wales and will be in effect from am until pm on Friday. All trains in Wales are suspended on Friday. Amber warnings, the second highest alert level, for wind are in place across the whole of England from am to pm on Friday, while yellow weather warnings, the next level down, for wind and snow are in force for a large part of Scotland - where blizzards are predicted - and the whole of Northern Ireland.

Pupils from Welholme Academy in Grimsby, and Kingston Primary School in Benfleet, broached subjects many adults would avoid – including askingblind people dream in colour. Vlogger Siobhan Meade, who is completely blind after losing her sight at aged , was in the hot seat, answering everything the little ones put to her and her guide dog Marty. Asked by one of the kidsshe could dream, she said: “I do dream and I dream in colour. “That means when I’m dreaming, I can see, which is really cool.”  The young children couldnapost hold back their excitement as they asked Siobhan how she knew where her dog had been for a poo – and just how does she pick it up  “Marty has a special pen where I can take him to go to the toilet, and I have a special command I have to give for him to go to the -- “But I donapost want to say it too loud because I donapost want him to go to the toilet in here. That wouldnapost be nice, would it ” Siobhan joked. The video comes after a survey, commissioned by Guide Dogs, found  percent of children want to know what a person who is blind or visually impaired sees when they dream.The study of , children aged six to , and their parents, revealed a host of other questions kids would like to know the answer to. These include “how much can you see ”and “how do you choose your clothes ” . Along with, “how do you recognise people ”and “do you understand what colours are ” . Despite their curiosity,  percent of parents polled said their little ones have never asked them about disabilities – such as being blind or visually impaired. And over half of youngstersadmitted they were worried about talking to people who are blind, or people with a visual impairment, about their disability. But  percent of parents polled, via OnePoll, agreed their kids spending more time with people of their age who have disabilities would lead to greater equality and less stigma.  Siobhan Meade said: “Those without disabilities are naturally curious about how those with disabilities live their lives – not just kids, but adults too. “However, adults are perhaps more likely to feel uneasy addressing people from the blind or visually impaired community, possibly due to limited interaction with people with those impairments. “This is why meeting the children is so important – it’s a really wonderful opportunity to shape perceptions in a positive and accurate way, and of course, introduce them to Guide Dog Marty.” Lisa Petrie, head of children and young people service development for Guide Dogs, added: “Vision impairment is a massively growing issue in the UK. “Every day  more people join the two million already living with sight loss, and this number is set to double by . “Guide Dogs is here to help people with sight loss live the le they choose.

Christine Price had hoped a three-bed property in Stoke-on-Trent would be the perfect home as the young couple prepare to welcome a baby. But luckily the -year-old, who already has  grandchildren, realised something was fishy when she was asked for a £, aposdepositapos to be transferred upfront. It transpired the conwoman did not own the house in question at all.The fraud came about after mum-of-five Christine innocently posted on a Stoke-on-Trent Facebook page askinganyone knew of somewhere suitable.Stoke on Trent Live reports that she then received a message from a woman called claiming to be called Linda who said she had a house to let.aposLindaapos told Christine she lived in Canterbury and due to her aposbitter experienceapos of cancelled viewings she asked for the cash up front as security. She added thatthe house was not suitable, the money would be refunded in full.  Her ruse was rumbled when Christineaposs husband went to look at the property from the outside and noticed an estate agentaposs board. After calling the estate agentaposs Northwood, they confirmed they had never heard of aposLindaapos and the house already had a tenant. Warning others to be on their guard, Christine said: My bloodaposs boiling as so nearly got scammed. Iaposve been looking for a house for my son and his missus as theyaposre having a baby and want to live together. Theyaposve been saving for ages. Iaposd put a post on the Facebook page explaining what we were after.This woman claiming to be a landlady messaged me. At first I thought nothing was wrong but something told me in my gut that it wasnapost right. My hubby went to view the property from the outside and then called the estate agent whose board was still up. It turned out that they already had someone living there. The estate agent asked me the name of the supposed landlady and it wasnapost right. It was clearly a scam. When I called Linda out, she just told me I must have been at the wrong house and even said I wasnapost allowed to view her property without her there. Itaposs not against the law to suss a house out from the outside. The estate agent has been really good and got in touch with the real landlady. I also reported Linda on the Facebook page. She was expecting a deposit of £, which she probably would have gotI didnapost dig a bit deeper. This woman should be ashamed of herself. I just want to let other people looking to rent know that these scammers are out there andsomething doesnapost seem right, it probably isnapost. My son and his girlfriend had been saving for a long time to get the deposit together and they could have been back to square oneI hadnapost questioned it. A spokesperson for Northwoodaposs Stoke office urged prospective tenants to go through estate agents. They said: We are sorry to hear that the family almost fell victim to a scam, but are relieved to know that it was found out before any harm was done. The property in question had already been rented out, legitimately, by this office and our best advice to anyone looking to rent is to be extremely careful when using social media s and ideally always seek the guidance of a fully registered and accredited lettings agent such as Northwood to help you through the process.

Just when The Firm thought they had buried one of the most shameful and humiliating periods in its recent history, the Queen has been dealt another hammer blow. Scotland Yard launching a criminal probe into an alleged cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of Prince Charles’s charities is not just another extraordinary development in exceptional times. It may call into question the very fabric of those operating at the heart of the monarchy.  Once again, as she has done many times before in times of trouble, the Queen today summoned the strength to put on a brave face and put duty first. But one could not fail to be moved by her admission, walking stick in hand, that she was unable to move as she would wish while a dignitary was wheeled out for a photo-op at her Windsor home. Just as she should be preparing to revel in the glory of her remarkable  years on the throne, it seems as though events are imploding around her. The family had hoped the shame of Prince Andrew’s involvement with two convicted sex offenders would be finalised ahead of Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year. But questions will surely remain over the Queen’s judgment in helping her son make such a settlement to his sex abuse accuser, which largely remains shrouded in secrecy. All of this against a backdrop of another potential scandal, which may see her son Charles and grandson Prince Harry quizzed by police, albeit as witnesses in the first instance. If ever there was a time to unite and collectively take the strain, now is that time for the family. Whether they are too fractured to do so is a story to be continued.

The Mirror’s research shows the shocking depth of the social care crisisDon Hurst and Winnie in her current care homeByLucy ThorntonNews Reporter:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Thousands of families face the trauma of seeing elderly loved ones kicked out of care homes amid a “tsunami” of providers closing.The number of private care givers handing back local authority contracts has more than tripled in  months, research by the Mirror has revealed.And NHS England data showed that % of hospital patients fit for discharge cannot leave because there is no social care in place for them.On an average day, , patients remained in hospital who no longer met the criteria to be there. And the problem was mainly down to elderly patients being unable to get care in their own home or a residential place.  The Mirror’s research shows the shocking depth of the social care crisis. In , there were  contracts for residential care and care in the community handed back, while in just  months last year the figure was ,. The ed care contracts last year left , vulnerable adults suffering distressing upheaval. Some families were given just  hours to find a new home. The figures, revealed after Freedom of Information requests from the Mirror, suggest  care contracts are being handed back by providers each week. And we reveal the human cost of care home turmoil, with one daughter telling how she found her mother, who had advanced dementia, sitting in the middle of her cold and dark new room, with her head in her hands crying.  And a husband in Liverpool told us how he was “terried” his we, who has Alzheimer’s, would be moved too far away for him to carry on his daily visits. Care home bosses blame the closures on staff shortages, Covid, and a lack of funding from local authorities. The Care Quality Commission said staff vacancies in care homes were up from % in April  to .% in December. Kate Terroni, of the CQC, said: “Staffing pressures are being felt across all health and care settings. More stability in social care is the key that will unlock improved access and quality for the people who use it – and it will also help ease pressure on the NHS, enabling more people to leave hospital in a timely way when they are medically fit to do so.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under intense pressure from the unions to step in. UNISON General Secretary Christina McAnea said: “Ministers must hear the clanging alarm bells and invest in social care. “These figures paint a horrying picture of a broken system. Every failed contract means sub-standard care for elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and workers exploited with poverty wages and little or no sick pay. This has to stop.” Morgan Vine, of Independent Age, said: “We have been receiving a higher number of calls to our helpline from people in this situation. Increased care home closures illustrate just how much some care providers are struggling.”  Justin Russi, who runs care homes in County Durham and Teesside, said: “I got served at the checkout in the local supermarket by someone who used to be my senior carer. She was getting more money, doing less work, pushing someone’s shopping along a conveyor belt. “£. does not cut the mustard when you can go down to the local supermarket and get £ an hour. It’s a joke.” Nicola Richards, from Palms Row Health Care in Sheffield, had to close one of her three homes and warned of a “tsunami” of other closures to come across the UK. She said: “It’s heartbreaking to close a home. Care homes across the country have been in financial dficulty for a long time due to the current care system and a lack of government support.” Our research showed one area hit hard was Southend in Essex, where there were no care home closures at all in , then four in  and six in the first  months of . As of this month, just  remain open in the town. Essex County Council said: “Signicant pressures are being experienced nationwide. Essex is no exception.” From the  replies we received to our FoI requests, London councils were among those least likely to report having contracts handed back, with around half in the capital having none since . But the closures are having an impact on the NHS, data showing hospital bed occupancy at % and  trusts reporting occupancy above % last week.To operate safely, occupancy should be below % to cope with spikes. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust declared a critical incident yesterday due to overwhelming demand. Miriam Deakin, of NHS Providers, said: “Delayed discharges continue to be an issue, highlighting pressures across the health and care system.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “Care staff are working incredibly hard. We are doing everything we can to support them, including through a £.million recruitment fund.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UnisonNHSCare Quality CommissionHospitalsCare homesMental healthNursing homesAlzheimers diseaseFluSupermarketsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The small balls of tar were discovered on the coastline of seaside town Blackpool, Lancashire, sparking a major clean up operation. Their discovery comes after roughly  barrels of crude oil escaped from a pipe off the coast of North Wales, which supplies fuel to the Isle of Man. People have been urged not to touch the balls or attempt to remove them from the beach while clean up teams from oil firm ENI UK are sent in. A spokesman for the firm said: The clean-up teams are onsite and working closely with the local authorities and coastguard.  Pictures of the iconic beach have shown the small black balls strewn across the sand between the townaposs North and Central Piers. The burst pipe, which runs between two s named Conwy and Douglas, was shut off following the leak on Monday and remains closed. The coin-size pieces of tar are made up of a mixture of hydrocarbons and form when crude oil deposits are weathered after floating in the ocean. The local council said Storm Dudley is likely to see more balls wash up on the shore and has urged people not to touch or try to remove any of the balls. A spokesman for Blackpool Council said: Due to tidal conditions and a forecast of extreme weather conditions over the next few days, there is a possibility of more washing up.Our beaches will mostly be chained off due to high tides and storm force winds during this time, and we ask that people avoid these stretches to avoid any contact.

We’re firmly in the pro-pun camp, evenit can prove a little in-tents. Here, UK Pun Champion Richard Pulsford, aka The Punball Wizard, takes an irreverent look at the major stories grabbing the headlines. UK politicsThe Conservative Party, sorry, The Conservative Work Event, continues to ride out the Partygate storm. The PM has shaken up the Downing Street operation by ensuring the garden, previously used for so many gatherings without being cleared up afterwards, is now covered by one huge canape. On a lunchtime visit to the Carlsberg factory, Boris Johnson offered to add lager to the journalists’ broth but the bosses insisted he couldn’t ruin a pea soup in a brewery. The PM gave Jacob Rees-Mogg the new role of “Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency”. Apparently he wasn’t allowed to become Secretary of State for the Environment as his name sounds too much like re-smog. The royals Prince Andrew has settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by Virginia Giuffre. The Duke and Ms Giuffre reached an out-of-court settlement and he will pay an undisclosed sum. Andrew had already lost his Royal titles and patronages but is going to keep the title “Duke of Hazard”.The Queen wants Camilla to take charge of organising her collection of sea shells when she dies and hopes people will see her as the Queen Conch Sort. The cost of living In our house we were worried we couldn’t afford our electricity bill, but instead of disconnecting us npower offered a simple solution, and now we’re de-lighted. Wine With news that just two glasses of wine are enough to bring you up to your daily sugar limit, I’d like to point out that I don’t drink high-end plonk. My wine rack is held together with cellar tape. Another wine-related thing I learned this week is that there is an EU body that oversees the fortying of drinks with German wine. It’s an add hock committee. Bones A human femur was found in the River Thames by Simon Hunt, who was taking his name rather too seriously. Experts say the bone is about , years old and belonged to a person who was about ft in tall. SoKeith Richards ever needs a new hip then archaeologists have something more modern they can offer him. Trees I read that more than eight million trees have been lost to storm damage this winter. At first I thought, “You can’t palm me off, I’m not falling fir that one”, until I realised it was true. Well wood you believe it  It’s not good, that’s plane to see. In fact it’s such a horror show they could make it into a Tim-ber-ton film. I once tried scanning a book of tree poems at the supermarket self-checkout but it didn’t like the bark ode. I guess it must have been an unexpected xylem in the bagging area. Some people have no regard for nature. Like the time I was visiting a graveyard in Paris and I saw a couple hang their raincoats on a tree. I thought, that’s mac arbre.  Sport Kurt Zouma’s neighbour has naturally been worried about the safety of their cat. Zouma said it was fine because he was actually afraid of the cat, given it looked a bit vicious. So the neighbour suggested he just try giving it a stroke. Well, it took a few weeks, but after making it smoke a lot of cigarettes, it finally had one. The Ukraine crisis Russia has been playing a high stakes gamble with , troops poised to invade Ukraine at the drop of a ushanka. It’s almost asthey want to bankrupt their economy with people in the capital heard shouting: “Russia is having a closing down sale. Everything Moscow.”Labour MP Diane Abbott took a dferent stance to almost every other British politician by claiming that Russia had a point about NATO expansion, effectively meeting Ukrainian complaints with “Crimea river”.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenJacob Rees-MoggKurt ZoumaDiane AbbottPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkBoris JohnsonKeith RichardsLabour PartyCarlsberg ASEuropean UnionNatoConservative PartyRoyal FamilyEnergy billsPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She wrote: Iaposm  and suddenly last summer my hair started to turn white very rapidly. I have long black hair and itaposs very noticeable. Itaposs like in the span of two months a third of my hair suddenly turned white. It does not bother me in the slightest and I never wanted to cover it with dye because I actually like it. My boss is one of those people who inherited a company and only shows up at our workplace a few times a year, so I had not seen him since early . The two other times he was in the offices we didnapost coincide so this week was the first time he saw me in about a year. Without even saying hello he asked me, aposWhataposs wrong with your hair apos. I told him that since last summer my hair had started turning grey. He said this is a workplace and I have to aposmaintain my hygieneapos and aposmake an effort to look professionalapos because Iaposm representing aposhis brandapos. I work in an office space with  other people and I only interact with clients over the phone.  I do maintain my hygiene, my hair is clean and well kept and my grey hair doesnapost represent his brand for shit because not one of our clients has ever seen my face and I seriously doubt theyaposd care I have grey hair. Things then took a turn for the worse the following day when the woman was approached again to be told to dye her hair - and was told sheaposd be firedshe didnapost comply. She added: The next day I arrived at work and HR, who is the owneraposs brother-in-law and has that title just to collect a paycheque, asks me why I havenapost coloured my hair yet after my talk with the boss. I told him, aposyou canapost be serious right apos, and I tried to explain how grey hair has nothing to do with hygiene or being professional. He said he gets it but his brother-in-law told me to fix it because he wants me to aposbe my best selfapos andI donapost comply heaposs gonna have to discipline me for insubordination. The woman is now considering quitting her job, and commenters on Reddit have encouraged her to do so. One person said: Hygiene  Iaposm so sorry. I just canapost get over that. Iaposm so sorry youaposre facing it. Fighting it takes so much energy. What a bizarre shock. While another added: So grey hair is unhygienic now for women  Your employer has no right to control your appearance. And a third posted: If you either walk out or are fired, it would be best to let the clients that you work with know that you will no longer be able to help them due to your hair not being coloured.

However, there are others out there who are a little bit more decadent with their water consumption. Ryan Dubs, who works as a Creative Director, spends more on bottled water in a year than many will spend on wine in their entire letime, splurging ,per month on bottled water. With four fridges in his kitchen, Ryan has plenty of room for his monthly luxury and finds loading the bottles onto his shelves to be a very satisfying activity.Ryanaposs aqua tipple of choice is VOSS, a high-end water brand that prides itself on having one of the purest bottled waters of anywhere on Earth.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In a TikTok video that will leave any thrty shoppers wincing, Ryan can be seen packing away his pricey delivery, explaining that heaposs always been a water snob. Ryan - who goes by the username @ryandubs - said: I know what youaposre thinking, aposWhat the hell  Why do you care  Itaposs just water apos But I hate the taste of tap water. I cannot drink it. I can only drink bottled water, itaposs the only way Iaposll get it in me. Previously, Ryan would get equally enormous quantities of Fiji water delivered, but began to feel conscious about how much plastic waste he was creating, and wanted to try a more eco-friendly choice. Ryan explained: Voss is net carbon neutral so itaposs definitely a more eco-friendly choice. And yeah, itaposs a little pricey but I do buy it in bulk from the same type of place that would sell it to a hotel or a grocery store, so itaposs a bit better. Despite the staggering cost, Ryan appears to have no regrets about his spending. Reasoning that everyone has their thing, and claiming that his house guests just love being handed a nice, cold glass water bottle. However, as pleasant as that may be, many of those in the comments section have been left aghast at the extravagance of the monthly purchase, believing no water could possibly be that refreshing. Remarking on the privilege of having access to clean water in the first place, one person commented: People donapost have clean water or any water at all, and this guy out here saying, aposI hate the taste of tap water, I canapost get it in meapos.

The discovery has been deemed so important that boffins now want to expand the station to include a new biology lab to collect, process and analyse microbes in space without having to ship them back to Earth.Scientists have been surveying the craft - launched in , run by five international space agencies and manned by inter-changing crews of seven astronauts - for the presence of microorganisms for at least six years.  NASA scientists Dr Nitin Kumar Singh and Dr Kasthuri Venkateswaran said the newly-found strains might be a game-changer for the future of space crops. They said it was essential to find new bacteria that assist in plant growth under stressful conditions in extreme places with scarce resources. Researchers think the new bacteria could help with the eventual colonisation of Mars as their characteristics include helping vegetation grow.Meanwhile, NASA is considering whether to kill off the International Space Station by crashing it into the ocean within the next ten years.

Marie Unicorn, who works as a medical secretary says she soon began to feel aposmore herapos as people started commenting that she even looked like a unicorn. This convinced the -year-old to take the plunge and fill in forms to legally change her name. At the time, her plumber hubby Patrick Naisbitt, , jokingly askedshe was having a midle crisis, but fully supported her and told her to aposdo whatever makes you happyapos. Three years on Marie Unicorn [this is her first name] hasnapost looked back, and now daughters Elouise, , and -year-old Esme have even taken on the Sparkles moniker too. Despite being fully supportive of Marie Unicorn ditching her married surname, Patrick has said he wonapost be changing his, with his we joking aposheaposs a boreapos.  While the family loves the new name, not everyone has been so sure about it - with some others unable to believe itaposs real. After splashing out £ to get her name changed by deed poll, Marie Unicorn contacted all companies and utility providers to update her details from Marie Naisbitt to Marie Unicorn Sparkles. The majority have been plain sailing, with her driving licence, bank cards, finance information and work ID proving an easy transition. But poor Patrick spent  minutes on the phone trying to convince a bemused car insurance provider that the name change wasnapost a wind-up. Marie Unicorn, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, explained: My driving licence has been super easy to change, everything  has been really easy too. We had a couple of issues with the car insurance, my husband changed it over because I was already listed as a named driver. He was on the phone for  minutes and he was arguing with the bloke because he was going aposno, behave, tell me reallyapos and this went on for a while. It got really awkward, my husband was saying aposno seriously, check the driving licenceapos. We got it sorted at the finish. Everythingaposs been changed now, Iaposm just waiting for my passport to arrive but the name change has been done.  Marie Unicorn continued to say: I changed my name as I just wanted to be myself. I had a business called the Unicorn Beauty Club and people used to call me aposthe unicorn ladyapos because Iaposm obsessed with them. Iaposve always loved unicorns. It always annoys me the thought that giraffes and owls exist but a unicorn couldnapost. I used to collect unicorn things when I was younger, it just sort of got out of control when I got older. I love that they can be themselves and theyaposre so magical. She went on to share how watching Marie Kondo while going through a bout of depression spurred her on to make changes in her le.  I went through quite a bad depression in  and I just didnapost feel like me. I wasnapost happy so I decided to start making changes, she said. I saw Marie Kondo and she sayssomething doesnapost spark joy, throw it out. Thataposs what really inspired me and I started looking at my clothes and hair and thinking aposI donapost like any of itapos. I was wearing dark clothes and had straight black hair trying to look all sensible because Iaposm a mum but I wasnapost being me. I started making little changes and thataposs where it spiralled. Marie Kondo hasnapost just changed my wardrobe but my entire le, that one quote changed everything and has moulded the way I am now. My style before I changed was very mumsy. Iaposve just bought a big pink shiny coat, I wouldnapost have dreamed of wearing anything like this before. When I started dyeing my hair I started to think aposIaposm starting to feel more meapos. Then people said aposyou really do look like a unicorn nowapos and thataposs when I thought aposIaposm going to do itapos [do the name change]. Itaposs been a few years now since the mum made the change and she says she now couldnapost ever imagine changing her name back. Iaposll keep it for the rest of my le, she proclaimed.

In response to the claims, a spokesperson for Wetherspoons said: It is a legal requirement for all licensed premises to prevent the sale and consumption of alcohol by anyone under the age of  years old. Unfortunately, fake IDs are readily available over the internet which means that our employees, when checking a customer’s proof of age, have to be extremely vigilant and exercise a degree of discretion as to whether IDs presented to them are valid or not. Iniably this means that on occasion, customers who do present valid IDs will be refused service.

However, many of her TikTok followers were surprised by just how much her lips swelled upJessie had to reassure her followers that she was fine Image: @_jessiecarr TikTokByJulia BanimAudience Writer:,  Feb |commentsLip blushing - a semipermanent cosmetic tattooing procedure whereby pigments are injected into a personaposs lips - has risen in popularity in recent years, with more and more women seeking a full pout. Jessie Carr, a -year-old from Sydney, Australia, recently opted to go for this non-invasive procedure and was advised that there would be some temporary bruising and swelling. However, Jessie was surprised after some of her TikTok followers expressed amazement at how much her lips had swelled up, telling her that lip blush tattoo is not meant to look like that. Jessie - who has previously been open with followers about her botched fox eye threads - decided to document her healing process via a series of TikTok videos, and in the first one, her lips looked very swollen indeed. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Explaining that sheaposd had the procedure done for free as part of a collaboration, Jessie - who goes by the username _jessiecarr - said: I don’t want you guys to think they did a bad job because they definitely did a proper job and it’s meant to be like this.They were actually more swollen before and I think they’ve gone down slightly. She added: They were bigger and more bruised but now the bruises are slowly going away. Some of the swelling has gone down but it’s still very swollen. They were very sore and they still feel bruised but not as sore as when I was there getting it done. However, a number of Jessieaposs followers didnapost like the look of her tattooed lips, with one person writing, I specialise in lip blush in Sydney and this is way too swollen and it shouldn’t actually hurt.Others remarked that their lips definitely didn’t look like this after the same procedure. Jessie continued to document her healing process, all while reassuring her followers that her lips were totally fine. In a recent vid, taken six days after the procedure, the swelling had gone down considerably, and Jessie appeared pleased with the result. Explaining that they were now out of the peeling stage, Jessie revealed that they had been peeling for around four to five days, and that sheaposd had to keep on top of moisturising them every day.Detailing the aftercare she had to adhere to in the days after her lip tattoo, Jessie added: I had to avoid getting liquids and food on them and stuff. I could only get water on themI had to clean them. Now I donapost have to be as careful, and theyaposre really soft. Although she didnapost have to pay for them herself, Jessie told her now admiring followers that the procedure would set the average customer back around  to  , with results lasting for approximately three years.Do you have a lip filler or beauty story to share  We pay for stories.

Photos show the boy wedged against the side and is unable to move his arms and upper body. Video shared on social media, including by officials of Afghanistanaposs new Taliban government, shows the tearful little boy talking to his father.The dad is heard saying: Are you OK, my son  Talk with me and donapost cry, we are working to get you out. OK, Iaposll keep talking, the boy replies calmly.  The video was obtained by rescuers who lowered a camera down the narrow well by rope. Abdullah Azzam, secretary to Deputy Prime Minister, tweeted: A team is there with an ambulance, oxygen and other necessary things. A trench has been dug so workers can reach the boy, and the rescue looks similar to how the attempt to rescue little Rayan was carried out in Morocco.A second video has shown rescuers lowering food and drink down to the boy, and he appears to be eating and drinking. Freelance writer Sebghatullah Sadid in Afghanistan tweeted to say Haidaraposs health condition is reported as well by medics.

Tom Cashman, a comedian from Sydney, Australia, has provided another update in what he describes as the “ landlord reference saga” after having a flat application approved and then cancelled.The bizarre sequence of events is seemingly the result of his prospective landlord finding out about the clash he had earlier this year, with another rental property owner.At the beginning of February, Tom explained to his followers on Instagram and TikTok how he had his application for a rental property cancelled after asking his agent for proof the landlord had been good to prior tenants.He had asked his agent, Stephanie, to contact the landlord of his prospective rental to source a reference from recent tenants. He explained to his followers as he shared videos documenting the exchange, that this was only fair, as he had been asked to provide several rental references before having his application approved.But his unusual request appeared to have rubbed the landlord up the wrong way, and Tom wound up having the application “withdrawn” without his consent. “The owner does not wish to connect the previous tenants and that is not a requirement. All the best with your property search,” the agent told him. In Tom’s most recent video, he shares with his followers how he has had the conflict come back to haunt him as he ramped up the search for a flat with a new sense of urgency - with his current lease ending “this weekend”. “On Monday I went to an inspection for a two-bedroom place with a friend of mine, looking to move in with that friend,” Tom said. “It was looking good. We submitted the application and I was texting the real estate agent.” The estate agent asked himhe had “any requests” before he sent the application to the owner, then specically askedTom was “going to ask [him] for a landlord reference”. The pair exchanged a few messages joking about the saga, with Tom pointing out that this hadn’t worked out for him in the past before the agent askedhe was “legitimately interested in securing this property”. Tom responded to say that he was and that he needed a place “by this weekend”. To this, the agent said this shouldn’t be a problem, as he expected to have approval from the owner “shortly”. Speaking to his followers, Tom said at this point he had thought that the agent may have “[liked] that I’m the ‘landlord reference guy’”. The next morning, Tom said he received an email with a subject line reading “congratulations”, saying that he and his friend had secured the property. But any relief was short-lived, as the pair received another email just hours later, informing them that they had in fact been “unsuccessful”. “Strange turn of events,” the email read, “the owner has decided not to proceed with your application”. No reasoning was given as to why this had happened, with the agent simply stating that the decision was “final”. Tom said to his followers indignantly: “I must be getting trolled at this point. It’s very reminiscent of the first situation, where I get approved and then I get rejected. “Were they trying to replicate that, to get to me !” he asked. “I didn’t even ask this landlord for a reference,” he pointed out. “I asked another landlord for a reference - a completely unrelated person, weeks ago, and still that’s enough, that’s how power-mad these people are, that they’re rejecting me on that basis.” Tom said the situation was “not so funny” now, when he “desperately needed a place”, as opposed to a few weeks ago when he was casually looking.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

And the Bonnyrigg player was lucky to escape further punishment when he demonstrated his frustration by booting a stray ball over the fence into the adjacent field.Gala continued to dominate in the second-half and player manager Scott came on for his first appearance since taking over from Neil Hastings.And with his first-touch the former Hibs’ player  set up Murray who scored with a superb low angled drive..removeScott then tried his luck with a long-range effort from the half-way line but the keeper got back to save his shot.He then demonstrated his skills on the right wing before firing a low cross into the danger area but there were no takers.With time running out Rose were awarded a penalty, but Kit McRitchie produced a fine ing save to deny Curie and Rovers held on for a well-deserved - victory.Scott told us: “Before the game we told the players that we believe in them.“And we set our stamp on the game early-doors with a goal in the sixth minute and another in the th minute. Normally we have been conceding at these times of late. But to get the first goal then go on to have a dominant performance for the -minutes was very pleasing.“They had a - minute spell of pressure after the sending off but we got a foothold back in the game and it was comfortable in the end.“It’s been a learning curve and myself and Stevieare learning about the team and how they react in dferent situations and how we manage situations going forward.”Craig praised the contribution of Scott and told us. ”He’s hardly trained in three months due to a thigh and a calf problem. I’ve been trying to encourage him and told him that he was capable of playing and managing at Lowland League level. He’s got too much to offer on the pitch just now.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many.# Hebrews :.It#s a reminder to extend to others the grace that God has extended to us in Christ, to keep a short account of people#s wrongs.Pull up bitterness as a small weed before it grows.Be better, not bitter."},{"url":null,"title":"trees company show your garden some love this month","story":"There will still be frosts and winter weather ahead but you can plan and prepare for spring arriving.If one of your gardening new year resolutions was to plant a tree, now is the time to make that a reality.In the coldest months of the year, you can buy bare rooted or root balled trees which are cheaper and establish better.These trees and shrubs are lted straight from the ground and should be planted by the end of February whilst they are still dormant before there are any signs of growth, or by end of March, possibly into April, in the north of Scotland.Bare root and root balled trees can only be bought when the weather is cold because, once it warms up, the root ball dries out too quickly unless planted in the ground.By planting in winter, it means that by spring and early summer, trees will have benefited from optimum growing conditions and had the chance to establish their root system whilst dormant.The key to successful tree planting is to ensure you prepare the site well, first by digging a hole large enough to accommodate the root system. Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as

to a Transport Scotland Aviation Strategy Consultation.They say air connectivity is essential for leline services and supporting the economy of the Highlands and Islands and believe there are excellent opportunities for aviation to deliver improved sustainable low carbon connectivity – with the right investment and governance.To that end, they look forward to engaging collaboratively with Transport Scotland, local authorities and air operators to develop an ambitious aviation strategy for Scotland.In a covering letter to their response, Councillor Henderson and Mr Lyon said: #Air links form an essential, often leline, element of the transport network in the Highlands and Islands.#All domestic air services either depart or land at an airport in the Highlands and Islands.#They provide these locations with the only air connectivity that enables these areas to compete economically with other regions of Scotland.#The services also often provide access to essential services such as health and education as well as the means by which many centrally located services are delivered to these islands and remote communities.#They say sustained investment is required from the Scottish Government to achieve both the ambitious transition to net zero and fully realise the opportunities that transition can provide through improved connectivity and benefits to local supply chains.Particular investment is needed to support the development of these new technologies and the associated infrastructure required to support them, they claim.The letter adds: #HITRANS and HIAL welcome a collaborative objective-led review of all current support mechanisms including PSOs and the Air Discount Scheme but also all wider funding and infrastructure.#The starting point of this review should be to establish a minimum level of service to ensure the connectivity needed to support sustainable local economies and a fairer and more just Scotland.#Surface transport to all UK airports is currently founded on models which incentivise private car use – be it a reliance on car parking revenue at airports or the promotion of fly and drive over public transport by airlines.#Again, an extensive overhaul of existing policy and regulation is requiredwe are to meet net zero targets and deliver against the sustainable travel hierarchy within the National Transport Strategy.#Councillor Henderson and Mr Lyon added that stakeholders and businesses in the Highlands and Islands had repeatedly highlighted the importance of securing guaranteed access to international

organisation has helped about , people,  per cent of them children.Volunteers have put in more than , hours, with more than  cats and dogs also being fed.Pat Lemmon, who co-founded the group alongside Linda Mitchell, said that they moved into their new home shortly before Christmas.She said: “We encouraged the community to become more resilient by supporting its most vulnerable people in the ward.“Thanks to an initial donation from the community council we had start-up funds and, because of the brilliant relationship we developed with the Bridge Centre, staff and the Lamp of Lothian, we were allowed to operate from there.“From February to December, we gradually built up our name in the area through leaflet drops, social media and dferent appeals, and have been involved in Christmas, Easter and Mother’s Day appeals.“Then, in November last year, the referrals went through the roof – the hardship of ‘heating or eating’, and in some cases trying to make sure their kids were having a semi-decent Christmas, at the expense of the adult’s health and welfare.“Also round about this time, we realised with groups ing to The Bridge Centre we would have to find alternative premises.“The search began to find new premises and Mitchell’s Close became available.”Discussions are already under way between the group and East Lothian Council for retrospective planning permission at the new premises, previously used by a cake-making company, for a change of use and the installation of a handrail.East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, reported earlier this year that it had recorded its busiest ever month since opening nearly a decade ago.In December, close to , people were helped by the county charity.Mrs Lemmon told the Courier that the Lammermuir Larder, which supports people from throughout the Haddington and Lammermuir ward, had also been busy.She said: “In an ideal world, there would be no need for us.“What has also developed is we see ourselves as being the go between.“Occasionally, we have people we have built up trust with and they like to talk on the doorstep and we can help signpost them on to other agencies that can help.“We don’t just drop the food at the door, we build up a relationship with some of them as well.”People can be referred to the Lammermuir Larder by a range of professionals, as well as by the person themselves, by simply filling out a referral form.Mrs Mitchell stressed: “We are not just supporting people who are unemployed – we are supporting people that are working and still not able to feed themselves or their families.”The Lammermuir Larder has received support from a number of businesses and community groups in the town.Financial donations, as well as collections of food, have been made to the good cause.The group continues to look for donations of items, including small jars of coffee, diluting juice, tins of hot dogs, tuna and potatoes.Donations can be made at a range of businesses, including Kevin Watt Butchers in Haddington and the town’s Co-op store on Hopetoun Drive.For more information about the group, go to

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as energy efficient as possible while supporting landlords, tenants and homeowners to do the same by signposting to appropriate advice and support from partner agencies.“The new East Lothian Poverty

The recipe is for Dracula Salad and was her memorial to her late husband, Cruden Bay and his famous book.Also seen as an important Scottish link to the novel Dracula is the influence of Scottish writer Emily Gerard on Bram Stoker’s placing the plot in Transylvania.The Jedburgh-born author wrote a book about Transylvanian superstitions, which played a crucial role in Bram Stokers research when writing his classic novel.Scotlands capital also plays a part as the publishing house of Dracula was founded by Edinburgh bookseller and stationer Archibald Constable.Occultist and author JW Brodie-Innes, a leading member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawns Amen-Ra Temple in Edinburgh has been a personal friend.In his supernatural horror novel The Devils Mistress - first published in , three years after Bram Stoker died - he paid tribute to the Dracula author in a special dedication in his book.It says: \"To the memory of my dear friend, the author of Dracula, to whose help and encouragement I owe more than I am at present at liberty to state\".Dacre Stoker says he is now investigating what that \"more\" actually was.Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a spirtualist, also features in Bram Stoker story as a friend. He was at the Edinburgh authors marriage on  September .When Bram Stoker managed The Lyceum Theatre in London, he produced the Conan Doyle play A Story of Waterloo.In one letter Conan Doyle said that he had enjoyed reading Dracula adding: \"I think it is the very best story of Diablerie which I have read in many years.\"Dacre Stoker said: \"Both of these guys obviously were interested in the occult and Conan Doyle recognised that.\"Bram Stokers career as a theatre manager, also saw him heavily involved in the opening night of the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in .The Glasgow connection comes as Bram Stoker got the job to support the staging of plays at the Theatre Royal.There is a theory that name of RM Renfield, the fictional character that is unquestionably loyal to the vampire in the Dracula novel, was taken from Glasgows Renfield Street.A Visit Scotland source said of the trail: \"It will be something we will work with Dacre on, to look at related sites for a potential trail and how accessible they are for visitors, for instance,they are open to the public, and what the visitor experience would beadded to a self guided trail.\"An Experience Transylvania spokeswoman added: \"The intentions of the Scottish trail are to follow all existing and relevant Dracula connections in the region, including of course Cruden Bay.\"The trail could also take in the Aberdeenshire former fishing village of Collieston, where a shipwreck of a th Century Spanish galleon is said to have provided the inspiration for Bram Stokers second novel, The Mystery of the Sea.Further around the coast at Whinnyfold, Bram Stoker wrote his book, Lair of the White Worm.The Aberdeenshire village of Gardenstown is where the author stayed in  and could have finished writing Dracula which was published a year later.Dacre Stoker said: “Scotland is where many chapters of the novel Dracula were actually written. It was during his long walks along the beach of Cruden Bay and on to Whinnyfold where all of Bram’s earlier inspiration, notes and research came together. This area offered him peace and quiet, a far cry from the interruptions and the stresses of his office in the Lyceum Theatre in London.\"Many ask how come we don’t celebrate in Transylvania, Whitby or Dublin. All these other locations do play a role in the origins of Dracula, of course, but when it comes to celebrating the literary process - the process of a writer bringing the story to le - I think Scotland, is a given”.Jenni Steele, film and creative industries manager for VisitScotland said of the th anniversary event: “This is a fantastic opportunity for people to learn about the Scottish connections to this well-loved novel. Dracula holds such a sense of intrigue and mystery, and it’s easy to see why Bram Stoker was inspired by some of Scotland’s magical landscapes and locations on his travels – not to mention the fascinating connections he had with many other Scottish writers and personalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stand-russian-mafia-state","story":"Of course, it has already invaded the Crimea and Eastern Ukraine , which does not seem to trouble Mr Gillies. The irony is of course that it is precisely the threat posed by its bullying neighbour that has driven Ukraine to seek membership of Nato. And what then, Vladimir Putin demanding that Poland, which will abut the new enlarged greater Russia, not to mention the Baltic countries, must leave Nato, under threat of force of arms  Mr Gillies seems to think that big bullies like Russia are entitled to have a buffer zone, free of nuclear missiles adjoining their territories and draws comparisons with the Cuban crisis. However, all that has been superseded by missile technology. Mr Putin has been boasting recently that Russia now has \"invincible\" hypersonic nuclear missiles, which would be impervious to any defensive system.Of course, the present crisis has nothing to do with Mr Putin being fearful of an encroaching Nato. Ukraine is reckoned to be years away from joining Nato, which is in any case a defensive organisation, with no unied armed forces. He does not really fear an invasion by the Baltic countries, or indeed Ukraine,it ever joined Nato. In any event, what on earth would be the motive for attempting to invade Russia In the s, many people expressed surprise when the territorial ambitions of Adolf Hitler became apparent, yet it was all there, written down years before in Mein Kampf. Similarly, Mr Putin is on record as saying that the biggest geopolitical disaster in his letime was the demise of the Soviet Union, and last year, he wrote a ,-word essay, in which he in effect denied Ukraines right to exist as an independent nation. He believes that the Russian people are inisible from the Ukrainian people, and indeed the Belarusian people, whose corrupt dictator Russia currently supports. Ultimately, he wishes to absorb Ukraine into Russia.This is what this crisis, manufactured by Mr Putin, is all about. That, and the fact that this dictator, in charge of a mafia state which is in effect a third world country armed to the teeth, cannot afford to have on his borders a free and democratic Ukraine , and which, particularlyit ever joins the European Union, is likely to become increasingly affluent.R Murray, Glasgow.* I DO not understand why Isobel Lindsayrefers to the entirely legal and greatly welcome presence of US and Nato forces in Europe in relation to the Russian military activity on the Ukraine border.Russia has already invaded Crimea and partially occupies Eastern Ukraine at the cost of many innocent lives, has been implicated in the breach of the EU border at Poland Belarus and was widely reported to have been party to the shooting-down of a passenger aircraft over Ukraine in . Vladimir Putin has been in power for about  years and his state apparatus has, most likely, poisoned and now imprisons the leader of his opposition. Would any of us wish to face the consequences of a US withdrawal from European involvement Having in recent history been invaded by Stalin, Hitler and again by Stalin and now, partially, by Putin, all at the cost of many innocent lives, Ukraine may well wish to seek international help to fend off Russias further attentions. It might satisfy Mr Putin in the short term for Ukraine to become a neutral state but Ukraine’s long-term peace and stability seems likely to be best served by Nato membership.Michael Sheridan, by Strachur, Argyll.NO CONCEALING THE TORY DAMAGEANDREW Dunlop writes that the \"Tories are doing more for Scotland than the SNP ever will\" . That explains why Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross wouldnt meet with Boris Johnson on his latest foray into \"North Britain\".The post-Brexit reality is grim and no amount of furious political spin can conceal it. Before leaving the world’s largest free trade bloc, exports accounted for a fth of Scottish GDP. In the year to June , exports had plunged % compared to . James Withers, head of Scottish Food and Drink, said many firms have simply “given up” on trading with EU companies because of the “tsunami” of red tape and said the worst is yet to come.As for replacing the annual £. billion Scotland lost from EU structural funds, a Westminster cross-party report said the UK Shared Prosperity Fund will fall short by %.The loss of free movement has cost thousands of jobs, particularly in the hospitality, care and road haulage sectors, and has resulted in price increases and widespread shortages.And because the UK Government rejected an offer of visa-free travel for touring musicians across the EU, Scottish artists can no longer afford to travel to and perform in Europe. The termination of the Erasmus scheme means thousands of Scottish students no longer have the chance to live and study in the EU.Mr Johnson says he is \"working very hard\" to unite people. In Scotland he is succeeding. He is uniting us against Westminster rule.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.SO WHERE IS THE OPPOSITION IT is becoming clear that unionism is a transmissible disease. What started with the shared opposition of Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats to the desire of the people of Scotland, expressed through more than a decade of electoral victories, for an independence referendum now extends to the other great issue of our times, namely our relationship with the European Union.Sir Keir Starmer has at last come off the fence, assuring voters in the north-east of England that there is no going back on Brexit , while Ed Davey has said that the Liberal Democrats, of all people, are not the party of rejoining the EU.An easy ride for the Conservatives, then, leaving us all to wonder what grounds the other national parties have for taking the money as Her Majesty’s Opposition at Holyrood or Westminster.James Scott, Edinburgh.STURGEON IS ALL ABOUT IMAGEI DON’T knowyou deliberately placed these two articles next to each other on Page  today, but it was interesting to note the headlines – “SNP ministers urged to act faster to mitigate £ real terms cut to Universal Credit” and “FM boosts global hub spending ahead of plans to hold IndyRef” .Take a moment to consider that we have a Scottish Government that is more interested in boosting its image abroad by spending an eye-watering £ million on overseas offices. This is a reserved matter and none of our taxes should be squandered in this way.While we have people in need of financial support due to the increase in the cost of food and energy, the SNP should not be wasting our money on such self-aggrandisement. The people who vote for Nicola Sturgeon should take note that she would rather further her own aims than help them pay their heating bills.Politics is all about choices and Ms Sturgeon’s choices are all about her image, not about caring for the less well-off.Jane Lax, Aberlour.THE TRUE SIZE OF GREEN SUPPORTMARK Smithstates that the Green Party attracted an \"execrable\" .% of the constituency vote at the  Scottish Parliament election. This is of course literally true, but as a representation of Green Party support is dishonest. Most voters didnt even have the opportunity to vote Green on their constituency vote and those who did knew that they had no chance of electing any Green MSP through this route. Its arguably remarkable under these circumstances that even .% of voters voted for them there.The real Green support is shown in the list vote, where everyone could vote for them and where votes are not wasted in the same way. There, they received more than eight per cent of the vote – still a minority, but considerably larger than Mr Smith represents.David Clinton, Hamilton.Read more: Johnson cannot escape the contempt of the people of Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-andrew-keep-titles----shows-nobility-no-better-rest","story":"This would facilitate perpetuation of the illusion that members of the titled classes are morally and socially superior to the rest of us.No thank you.Let him keep his titles and do not disguise or obscure the undeniable truth, well supported by history, that disreputable characters are no less likely to be found among nobility and royalty than among the untitled masses which I am proud to belong to.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.ROYALS CAN NOW REBUILDPRINCE Andrew has finally thrown in the towel and settled out of court, which rescues his mothers celebrations in her Platinum Jubilee from all the unsavoury revelations which could well have emerged from the court proceedings he claimed to be ready to face. Perhaps he could now devote himself to doing unsung charity work behind the scenes to atone for his errors of judgment while the task of restoring the somewhat tarnished reputation of the monarchy is left to Charles and Camilla along with William and Kate.No doubt after all this adverse publicity the royal family needs a boost to cement its standing in the eyes of the nation and to maintain its position of providing our head of state in keeping with the honourable tradition which brings pageantry and colour with its benefits to our nations tourist income.If the Queen now chose to abdicate at the conclusion of her Platinum Jubilee year, the door would be open to a fresh wave of what would assuredly be positive and good publicity to wash away the stain which has been haunting the institution of the monarchy for some years now.And Her Majesty, who has faithfully observed her duty to the country, could enjoy her well-deserved retirement, knowing that no one will ever be able to match her record as the longest-ever serving monarch.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.* I AM pleased Prince Andrews lawyers have agreed a pay-off over the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre.

With the help of the passenger with the phone, and the call handler, it was a real team effort and we helped to save John’s le.”Mr Bell said he alerted the depot and a passenger called for an ambulance, and he carried on speaking to Mr McCann in an effort to re-assure him.He added: “He was visibly in pain, moving in his chair, struggling to speak and breathe and was quickly getting worse,” Mr Bell said.“I got him into the recovery position, at which point he was no longer speaking, and his lips were turning blue.

New and permanent environmental teams and investment in parks and green spaces is planned too. Cllr Bell added the budget will “address the decades of neglect of our built heritage and cherished buildings”. A council tax rise is expected and details on that as well as any savings required, which are understood to have reduced from the expected £.m, will be revealed today. Glasgow by air Cllr Jon Molyneux, Greens, said the budget delivered against his group’s three main priorities: the cost of living crisis, reopening and renewing community venues and accelerating. He said they have set a “clear expectation” that Glasgow’s “valued” foster carers deserve an increase to their allowance. The Greens will “make sure all our museums and dozens of local venues open their doors soon too”, he added. : Glasgow council facing £m black hole in budgetAnd there will be “progress on a free public transport pilot, a city-wide mph zone, a massive wildflower city plan and investment in local, renewable energy”. As the SNP does not have a majority in Glasgow, it requires the support of other councillors to pass its budget. Cllr Bell said: “This is a budget which responds to Covid recovery, to the cost of living crisis and to the priorities identied by our citizens. “Emerging from the two-year tragedy and devastation of the pandemic, Glaswegians now find themselves facing soaring energy costs, hikes in food prices, and rising inflation and National Insurance Contributions. “We can’t wait for the UK Government to step up to the plate.

Parents were notied on Wednesday afternoon.Ms Easton said: “We recognise that this is incredibly frustrating for parents who rely on childcare within the nursery, but we have reached the position where closure is unavoidable given the reduced staffing available.#As I’m sure you will appreciate this is a fast-moving situation, but I will continue to update parents of any changes as timely as is possible.“As always we will work through all contingencies to see how a reopening can be managed safely. We thank you for your patience and understanding during these trying times.”All COVID-related situations within schools and nurseries are reviewed on a daily basis by the inter-disciplinary team which includes representatives of NHS Orkney Public Health, the Council’s Education Service, Environmental Health, Safety and Resilience, and affected schools and nurseries.These authorities say it is vital that everyone continues to carry out twice-weekly lateral flow tests and to report the results, where negative, positive or void online here: https:www.nhsinform.scot campaigns coronavirus-covid--report-your-test-result Self-isolating when you are asked to is the best way to prevent the spread of the virus.

Far from being worthwhile, they were harmful and disruptive.”He continued: “Given all the issues that came with vaccine passports and their lack of effectiveness, Labour should never have put them on the table in the first place.“Our focus now moves to securing commitments to the end of all Covid laws and forcing the LabourGovernment to end their focus on pet projects so Wales can get back on track and recover from the pandemic, evenLabour’s record suggests they will be incapable of doing so.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

some areas, meaning people are warned to stay indoors.A rare red weather warning – the highest alert, meaning a high impact is very likely – has been issued by the Met Office due to the combination of high tides, strong winds and storm surge.There is a risk of “flying debris resulting in danger to le” and “damage to buildings and homes, with roofs blown off and power lines brought down” along the coastline of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset as well as the south coast of Wales from Friday morning.⚠️⚠️🔴 Rare Red Weather Warning Issued 🔴⚠️⚠️#StormEunice will bring extremely strong winds across parts of Southwest England and south WalesFriday  – Latest info 👉 https:t.co QwDLMfRBfsAdvice 👉 https:t.co JFRaCtfWYStay #WeatherAware⚠️ pic meseAXoV— Met OfficeFebruary , The Cobra emergency committee met on Thursday “to discuss the response to Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice”, the Government said.Ministers have been urged to ensure the meeting results in an emergency support plan to deal with power cuts.The Energy Networks Associationsaid everyone has been reconnected after Storm Dudley caused disruption on Wednesday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the Army is on standby to help those affected by Storm Eunice.During a visit to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, he said: “So for those who have already been affected by Storm Dudley, we are offering all the support that we can. vw,vw,px, px\"“My sympathies to those who are still without power – we are working with the power companies, the local authorities, to get their juice restored as fast as possible.“But of course, the Army is on standby.”Amber warnings, the second highest alert level, for wind are in place across the whole of England from am to pm on Friday, while yellow weather warnings, the next level down, for wind and snow are in force for a large part of Scotland – where blizzards are predicted – and the whole of Northern Ireland.Severe and signicant flooding may also take place along the coastlines of the south and west of England as spring tides are expected on Friday morning.A number of attractions, including the London Eye, Legoland and Warwick Castle, are temporarily closing.A National Trust spokesperson said: “Most of the places we look after in the south, south west and east of England, in the Midlands, and in Wales will be closed tomorrow due to the incoming storm, with some sites also shut in the north of England and Northern Ireland.“We’re urging people to follow local advice and to check our website for more information.”A number of parks and open spaces including Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, west London, and Wakehurst, West Sussex, will also be closing their doors, it was announced on social media.Some councils across the UK are to help shelter homeless people and halt bin collections. vw,vw,px, px\"With the storm approaching, some local authorities have activated their Severe Weather Emergency Protocolto provide emergency accommodation for rough sleepers.The scheme usually operates when temperatures drop to below freezing.North Cornwall, north Devon and Sharpness in Gloucestershire could be the worst-hit areas due to the tidal impact from the surge and very high spring tides.Fluvial flooding, which is when the water level in a river, lake or stream rises and overflows, is likely over the weekend in areas including the Pennines, North Yorkshire, Lancashire and the upper reaches of the River Severn due to a combination of after-effects of Storm Dudley and snow melting. vw,vw,px, px\"It is understood that incident rooms are open and pumps and other equipment are on standby at strategic depots should the flooding become severe.The Environment Agency has issued  severe flood warnings, meaning there is a danger to le.Avon and Somerset Local Resilience Forum has declared a major incident over the “potential for severe disruption” to the region as a result of the weather.The forum, whose members include the emergency services, health services, Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Environment Agency, said people should avoid travelling on Friday morning “wherever possible”.A major incident has also been declared in Cornwall, with residents advised not to travel unless absolutely necessary, and to stay away from exposed coastal areas.Assistant Chief Constable Wasim Chaudhry, chairman of the Greater Manchester Resilience Forum, said: “Storm Eunice will see us affected by winds that are unusually high for an inland area and is likely to cause some problems.“Most notably we can expect to see falling trees or debris, damage to roofs or structures under construction and very dficult driving or travelling conditions. There is also the risk of power cuts.“I’m confident that together we are all well prepared, have the people and resources in place that we may need and a strong plan to respond to incidentswe need to.“We’ve learnt from previous bad weather events – including Storm Dudley from earlier this week – and are well placed to handle any arising problems.”Strong winds from Storm Eunice could cause trees to be blown on to train lines, possibly leading to delays and cancellations, the Rail Delivery Group said.A Network Rail spokesman said disruption is “inevitable” and Welsh services will be suspended for the whole day.The railway operator said there will be blanket speed restrictions of mph in most places, with winds forecast to reach mph in some areas.The decision for a countrywide closure of lines in Wales “has not been made lightly”, said Bill Kelly of Network Rail Wales and Borders.He added: “The safety of passengers and staff is our top priority.”London North East Railway has urged customers with tickets for Friday to travel on Thursday or Saturday instead or get a refund due to expected disruption and damage.Some airports including Gatwick and Stansted are advising customers to check the status of their flights with airlines, as well as allowing plenty of time to travel.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645020787354.jpg--covid_19___wed_16th_february_figures.jpg?1645020787000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220216newscovid 19 wed 16th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Where that doesn’t exist, it’s very hard to see how a merger would be successful”.“That’s why it’s vital community discussions are enabled, and they need to be enabled before any action plans are put in place, otherwise those action plans will not be workable,” she said.“Big decisions need to be taken by managing authorities, but we want to make sure parents and communities are listened to before they are made.”Related topicsUniversity of UlsterMore On University of Ulster PremiumNorthern Ireland’s rural property prices rise, but values in Derry slump by £kNI university staff begin -day strike action over pay and ‘brutal’ pension cuts Premium‘I’ve become a sobriety coach... and I really could have done with one in the past myself’ PremiumStudent numbers drop at Magee despite countless commitments to expandUlster University and Queen’s make their Sigerson Cup exitMost ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandNato: Russia misleads world on troop movements near UkraineTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest EducationHalf-term holidays in Northern Ireland: A guide to the best family fun daysTeachers ‘ready to strike’ after rejecting pay offerSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removalsDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveLatestUS golf course which hosted major tournaments suffers devastating fireKate Winslet to present SAG letime achievement award to Dame Helen MirrenLeicester take step towards Conference League last  with routine Randers winUS firms axing plans to invest in NI because of Stormont crisisSnow warnings for most of Scotland as Storm Eunice hits,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I have read what JCVI published.“I genuinely don’t know what I would domy children were that age. I would think very carefully. If my children were in the older age group, I would talk with them. I would also maybe have a talk with my GP and with other parents.“I was in support of the older children being vaccinated. The JCVI advice is not one way or the other.“Parents should be allowed make the decision that’s right — they shouldn’t be pilloried, they shouldn’t be attacked.”“I don’t envy parents making this decision.”While Ms Yiasouma said parents could speak to their family doctor about the issue, there are also concerns this could lead to a spike in telephone calls to already overstretched GPs.Dr Ultan Power, a professor of molecular virology at Queen’s University, said much more work is required to ensure parents can make an informed decision.“I think this is something that should be done by the Department of Health or Public Health Agencyso that parents have somewhere to go to have their questions answered,” he said.Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, last night offered reassurances to parents, although she did not provide evidence there will be no long-term harm caused by the vaccines.“There is no evidence that the vaccine will lead to problems later in le,” she said.“As with any medicine, these vaccines are highly regulated products.“The Covid- vaccines are safe and effective and will give the best protection against coronavirus.”She continued: “The Covid- vaccine is being offered to all children aged five to  years in order to protect against severe disease and increase the immunity of vaccinated people against Covid- in advance of a potential future wave of Covid-.“While most children aged between five and  will have mild disease following infection from Covid-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group may also prevent a small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions, and would provide short-term protection against non-severe infection.“The impact of vaccination on future waves of Covid- is still unknown as it will depend on the characteristics of any new iants that emerge, for example timing, size and severity of infection.“While it is yet to be understood what the impact of vaccination in this age group will be on rates of infection as a whole, it is likely to provide short-term protection against illness and reduce the number of iniduals that may require admission to hospital.”Dr Johnston said the vaccines will reduce the risk of children developing paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome .The condition can happen in some children and young people after they have had Covid- and some youngsters have already received intensive care treatment after developing PIMS.Dr Johnston explained: “The condition is a delayed reaction to the body trying to overcome the virus, and this causes swelling throughout the body.“Receiving a Covid- vaccine will help to protect children against the likelihood of developing PIMS and long Covid.“If we see a future severe wave of Covid- infection, the vaccination programme could help to prevent  hospitalisations for PIMS for every million vaccine courses delivered.”She also said children who have already had a Covid- infection will be further protectedthey are vaccinated.“While having had the virus may give you some immunity, being fully vaccinated can offer you the best protection from the virus and severe disease,” she said. “Evenyou’ve already had Covid-, you could still get it again. The vaccine will reduce your risk of another infection and the severity of symptoms.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthMore On Department of Health PremiumMark BainOpinionCovid vaccination and children: An informed choice would be more welcome than a shot in the darkPublic inquiry in NI is vital for bereaved families, says solicitor PremiumSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removalsHealth service dealt blow as budget cannot be introduced due to Stormont crisisBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsMost ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetNato: Russia misleads world on troop movements near UkraineTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandDuplication of rural schools on religious lines ‘unsustainable’New Tigers Bay theatre project setting the stage for the next Kenneth BranaghSinn Fein minister expresses hopes of ‘unlocking’ funding amid sports controversyStorm Eunice: Northern Ireland agencies on alert for wind and snow disruption on FridayInstitutional abuse victims group rejects ‘downgraded apology’ plansLatestKate Winslet to present SAG letime achievement award to Dame Helen MirrenLeicester take step towards Conference League last  with routine Randers winUS firms axing plans to invest in NI because of Stormont crisisSnow warnings for most of Scotland as Storm Eunice hitsProud Van Bronckhorst urges Rangers to finish the job after shock Dortmund win,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Tristan Morrow.Niamh CampbellTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA young Kilkenny unionist has revealed that he and his family were forced to move to Northern Ireland after receiving IRA death threats.Tristan Morrowhas made headlines for creating the Irish Unionist Party . He believes the island of Ireland as a whole should become part of the UK – and in turn, separated from the EU – due to what he sees as universal economic benefits for all nations involved.The idea for his new political movement stemmed from his research of past, archetypal Irish unionists.“I then came in contact with a man from Co Clare with similar views to me,” he told the Belfast .“Quickly, we got a big group of southern people who have unionist views. Somebody said that we should start a movement over this and we thought it was a pretty good idea. We started it within the last year, maybe the year before, and we took it quite seriously.“At the moment, we haven’t been having or going to events, but so far we have  members and we should be getting a whole lot more in the coming weeks due to a new contact with the Donegal Orange Lodge. There’s massive interest in it.”But Mr Morrow’s views have led to stress and abuse towards him and other members of his group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “One of our members got sent a picture of a revolver gun and the guy said he knew where he lived and actually mentioned his house address. We quickly got that sorted by reporting it.“I have received some real-le threats from local republicans. I’m out in the countryside and whenever I’m on my walk into town and back home, I’ve had a car stop in the middle of the road and just rev at me for a good  seconds, and as they’ve driven past they#ve shouted ‘tiocfaidh ar lá’.“I#ve had to live up here in Northern Ireland for a few years now, due to my family having to move away from Kilkenny because of the IRA. I believe it was the Co Laois IRA that had decided they had enough of my family and they gave us a week to move, otherwise they#d kill us all.”Raised on a Kilkenny farm, Mr Morrow said his family is still supportive of him.“My father had saidI was going fully public about my views, that he would stand with me,” he added.He also believes the whole of Ireland should have a referendum to determine whether it would want to join or leave the UK.“In my perfect scenario, I would imagine Ireland taking part within the union sort of like how Scotland does. A united Ireland would be beneficial for both sides, but also I would like us to be united with the English economically and as one nation. I don’t see how we could not benefit from it.“And it sort of seems that the only reason people don’t want it is over tribalism. Sort of like, ‘they’re English, we don’t want to be united with the English’.”He also noted that while some members of the IUP want to remain within the EU, he would like to see Ireland follow a Brexit-like referendum.“The majority of us would like to see us out of the EU and to have more uptake into the actual world stage of economic trade, especially with the Commonwealth.“We#ve had a lot of new converts to unionism who have literally no background with it. But due to what happened in  [the financial crash], a lot of them have become outright unionists.”Mr Morrow spoke of one man from Limerick, who he said took him around dilapidated streets in the city which were once thriving with shops and businesses, but are now “rotting away”.“He was talking about how after  years, this is what all that has won us - just nothing.”Mr Morrow said that he looks “forward to what the future holds” and has welcomed the support of some like-minded unionists from Northern Ireland, including independent politicians and members of the UUP.On Wednesday, he tweeted: “Irish Unionism will be normalised in due time.If Ireland is to be united, it will only be possible through unionism heading the charge.I will always be a Kilkenny man, my family loves Kilkenny and I will never give up on my hometown.After facing some online backlash for the post, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie replied: “Stay safe Tristan. Nobody deserves threats for having a political view.”Most ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetNato: Russia misleads world on troop movements near UkraineTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandHealth bosses under pressure to provide more information on safety of vaccinating children against Covid-Duplication of rural schools on religious lines ‘unsustainable’New Tigers Bay theatre project setting the stage for the next Kenneth BranaghSinn Fein minister expresses hopes of ‘unlocking’ funding amid sports controversyStorm Eunice: Northern Ireland agencies on alert for wind and snow disruption on FridayLatestKate Winslet to present SAG letime achievement award to Dame Helen MirrenLeicester take step towards Conference League last  with routine Randers winUS firms axing plans to invest in NI because of Stormont crisisSnow warnings for most of Scotland as Storm Eunice hitsProud Van Bronckhorst urges Rangers to finish the job after shock Dortmund win,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, some will rise more than others. Heres a guide to why this is the case, how rates are calculated and where the money goes.Read MoreBigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsHow are rates calculated Rates are made up of two parts: the regional rate and the district rate. The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by your local council and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.Finance Minister Conor Murphy has frozen the regional rate for the coming financial year, due to the lingering impact of the pandemic and the current poor financial climate.District rates are either domesticor non-domestic . While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year all councils have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both. Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of your home business by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Why are rates increasing, and why are they rising in some areas more than others There are several factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the council#s own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.Some councils may be able to mitigate the rise through other savings, while those local authorities which are in a more financially healthy state, can strike a lower rate and use their savings to make up for the loss.Where does the money go As mentioned, district rates pay for services the council is responsible for. Many councils also increase rates with an eye on using some of the revenue for particular projects.Ards and North Down council, for instance, has said the money for the coming financial year will go towards redeveloping Bangor Waterfront and creating an #innovation hub#, while in Belfast some revenue will go towards supporting the development of office accommodation, hotels and retail as part of city centre development. In Fermanagh and Omagh, the council said the rates will raise around £m in extra revenue, £m of which is to be set aside for waste management.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilArds and North Down Borough CouncilFermanagh and Omagh District CouncilMid and East Antrim Borough CouncilAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough CouncilCauseway Coast and Glens Borough CouncilDerry City and Strabane District CouncilArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsBelfast councillors refuse request from cinema owners to change Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years on PremiumMark BainOpinionThe end is nigh, and thankfully the world is looking brighter than two years agoCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young peopleMost ReadMotorist lucky to be alive after tree falls on his car during Storm DudleySinn Fein taking Justice Minister post following next election ‘very dficult’ for unionists, claims Arlene FosterAlliance councillor Michael Long apologises over ‘clumsily worded’ Bloody Friday tweetStorm Eunice: Met Office updates wind and snow warning as second storm in a week set to hit Northern IrelandNato: Russia misleads world on troop movements near UkraineTop VideosPlayMet Office warns of #danger to le# in parts of England during Storm Eunice \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandHealth bosses under pressure to provide more information on safety of vaccinating children against Covid-Duplication of rural schools on religious lines ‘unsustainable’New Tigers Bay theatre project setting the stage for the next Kenneth BranaghSinn Fein minister expresses hopes of ‘unlocking’ funding amid sports controversyStorm Eunice: Northern Ireland agencies on alert for wind and snow disruption on FridayLatestKate Winslet to present SAG letime achievement award to Dame Helen MirrenLeicester take step towards Conference League last  with routine Randers winUS firms axing plans to invest in NI because of Stormont crisisSnow warnings for most of Scotland as Storm Eunice hitsProud Van Bronckhorst urges Rangers to finish the job after shock Dortmund win,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need to find a way of unlocking that money without the Executive,” she said.Ms Hargey confirmed she has met officials in both the Irish Football Association and Northern Ireland Football League to discuss the matter after criticism of her decision by the bodies and clubs across the province.Following the meeting she said: “I welcomed the opportunity to reaffirm my commitment and intention to deliver this much needed scheme which will benefit football at all levels.“Today I have met with representatives of IFA and NIFL and together we will work to progress this project to the next stage.”The NIFL welcomed her statement of intent after what they called a “dficult week”.NIFL CEO Gerard Lawlor stated: “I welcome the minister’s response to our concerns this afternoon.We held an open and frank discussion and we received assurances: the programme will proceed as planned, acknowledgment that an increase on the m is required and is being sought, and the programme remains a flagship project for the Executive.Communication is key in the delivery of this programme going forward and I hope to see it delivered in a timely manner”.The DUP has sought to portray the comments of Ms Hargey as a u-turn.The party’s deputy leader accused Ms Hargey of attempting to “play sectarian politics” with the issue.“The Minister has had two years to deliver the funding.“Indeed, last September she told us it was just weeks away,” Paula Bradley said.“It’s time for Minister Hargey to set her Sinn Fein political games to the side and get on with her job and deliver the funding.”Earlier it was revealed Steven Mills, Chief Operating Officer at NIFL, has invited a representative from each club to a special meeting at Windsor Park on Monday, kicking off at pm.Ms Hargey has claimed that while the funding has been secured for the initiative, the approval of the wider Executive is required before it can progress to allocating funding for projects at specic grounds.She has blamed the DUP for the situation, claiming the party’s decision to pull Paul Givan out of the first minister’s role meant the stadia programme had to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: “The Minster has been clear that the .m to regenerate stadiums is ring fenced.“The Minister is absolutely committed to delivering this investment to support clubs and build first class facilities.“It is well known that options for the future of the sub regional stadia programme requires Executive approval.“The collapse of the Executive is preventing the regeneration of local stadiums.“The Minister is exploring all options available in the current situation.“Today the Minister held a meeting with representatives of the IFA and NIFL and agreed to work together to progress this project to the next stage.”Related topicsDeirdre HargeyDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Deirdre HargeyIrish League

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailColum Eastwood has accused Sinn Fein of focusing on selfish party interests rather than improving the lives of ordinary people.The SDLP leader said his rival’s -year record in government was abysmal, and while the party had engaged in radical rhetoric, it had failed to deliver.Speaking ahead of his party’s annual conference this weekend, Mr Eastwood said that despite lacklustre poll ratings, the SDLP hoped to secure two ministries in the next Executive.However, he refused rule out going into oppositionhe didn’t believe that it would be “a government truly working for the people”.In a wide-ranging interview, he described Doug Beattie as “a breath of fresh air within unionism”. While he was aghast at the UUP leader’s tweets, he respected how he had faced up to his mistakes, taken the heat and opened himself up to scrutiny in media interviews.Mr Eastwood also said he had no regrets about using parliamentary privilege to name Soldier F, who faced murder charges for his actions on Bloody Sunday.He said he was “giving a voice” to the people of Derry in a House of Commons that desperately needs to hear views from Northern Ireland other than the DUP’s.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Despite at times sharing similar policies with Sinn Fein, Mr Eastwood insisted the parties were in practice very dferent.“Sinn Fein are interested in themselves alone. They’re focused on what benefits them as a party, what improves their position, securing community jobs for their mates,” he said.“They’ve been at the top in Stormont since  and have failed to change the lives of working-class communities despite having their hands on the levers of power.“After  years, you’ve had your chance. Those who don’t deliver should be punished at the ballot box. “Sinn Fein are not outsiders. With the DUP, they are the political establishment in the North.”Mr Eastwood was unimpressed with Sinn Fein’s performance in the current Executive: “They talk a lot, but don’t seem to do much. What have they actually achieved “Nichola Mallon and Robin Swann have been the outstanding ministers in the Executive. I don’t see too many others that have done much.”The SDLP leader accused the DUP of pursuing a “destructive and unbelievably foolish course of action”y.He expects his party to improve on its  seats and % vote in the  Assembly election. He is hoping it will secure a similar vote to its  Westminster result of %.“We would hope to gain enough seats to have two ministers in the next executive,” Mr Eastwood said.“We are running to be in government. It’s in our DNA to be in government.”But he said he could not rule out going into opposition “ we think it’s a government that will do nothing for the people”.On just % in this week’s Irish News Institute of Irish Studies of University of Liverpool poll, the SDLP seems to have a steep hill to climbit is tomore MLAs. Successive LucidTalk polls for the Belfasthave put the party in fourth or fth position.“I think that too much attention is given to polls in Northern Ireland,” Mr Eastwood said“As a deeply ided society, it’s one of the hardest places to poll. You have five political parties within  to % of each other, so it’s complicated.“We are not blind to polls, but neither are we worried about them. We do our own research and we’re confident that we’re not on %.”Mr Eastwood said the DUP’s decision to collapse the Executive had polarised the political environment in a way that suited Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party and Sinn Fein.But the SDLP leader predicted it would not be a “pro- or anti-protocol” election.“In my office in Derry, people aren’t talking about the protocol. They’re worried about bills and hospital waiting lists. They’re annoyed at sluggish government.“There has been no response to the cost of living crisis by Stormont. In Scotland, the government is putting money into people’s bank accounts. Ours is doing nothing.”The SDLP leader said that in some constituencies, his party would be battling with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s for the last seat, “and that will create a dynamic which helps us”.He cited Strangford as its best chance of a gain, followed by Fermanagh and South Tyrone and West Belfast, “while there’s an outside chance we will be in the mix at the end in South Antrim”.The SDLP faces a tough battle to retain its seats in three constituencies. However, Mr Eastwood was “very confident” Pat Catney would be re-elected in Lagan Valley he said Dolores Kelly should “never be written off” in Upper Bann and he believed his party had “enough votes to keep our two seats in South Down”.The SDLP leader said he wouldn’t be advising voters who to transfer to. “There’ll be dferent considerations in dferent constituencies,” he said. He would like people “to vote progressively and for change”.AskedSDLP supporters should transfer to unionist candidates he said: “If a candidate is progressive, then there shouldn’t be community barriers to giving them a preference. In the polling booth, I have and will transfer across the community ide.”In the wake of Doug Beattie’s tweet scandal, Mr Eastwood said he had “failed the leadership test”.Askedthe UUP leader should have resigned, he replied: “What Doug did was wrong and dficult to understand, but there was something very powerful in his ability to face up to his mistakes and to take the heat.“I think in those circumstances, people are ready to forgive. I certainly don’t agree with Doug on everything, but I like him. I think he’s coming at things from a good place. He’s a breath of fresh air for unionism.”Mr Eastwood said it had been “very important” for him to name Soldier F in the Commons.“The Bloody Sunday families wanted him outed and I wanted my constituents’ voices heard,” he explained.“I received numerous death threats for it, some more sinister than others. That’s fine for me, but it was hard for my family.“I didn’t believe anything would happen to them, but you still worry when you’re away from home at nights.”Mr Eastwood insisted that his party had influence at Westminster: “Claire Hanna and I are not going to overturn an -seat majority, but it’s vital that we — along with Stephen Farry — are there and it’s not just the DUP being heard.”He said that would particularly be the casean Executive could not be formed after May’s election and direct rule was reintroduced.The potential partnership with Fianna Fail, which Mr Eastwood had championed, is clearly now dead in the water for the SDLP.  Asked about the possibility, he would say only that he was “in regular contact” with Fianna Fail and that the shared island unit had “come out of our conversations” with Micheal Martin.Claire Hanna had strongly opposed any merger. Effectively acknowledging it was totally off the agenda now, Mr Eastwood stressed: “The SDLP stands on its own two feet.“We’ve moved beyond old arguments.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry. We are also very concerned about the lack of adequate consultation with key stakeholders, in particular, the Friends of Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Irish.jpg","title":"Documents of United Irish leader Thomas Russell  shows rich history held  in Down County Museum  ","story":"MANY people in County Down and beyond will be familiar with the words of Florence Mary Wilsonrsquos popular ballad, The Man from God Knows Where, published in  in her best-known collection of poetry, The Coming of the Earls.Her enigmatic subject was Thomas Russell mdash soldier, social reformer and revolutionary mdash who was hanged outside what is now Down County Museum in October .An intimate of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Russell was posted to Belfast as an ensign in the th Regiment of Foot in  and became a founding member of the Society of United Irishmen the following year.Associated with the development of the United Irishmenrsquos insurrectionary strategy in the mid-s, Russell journeyed across Co Down mobilising support for what was expected to be a rebellion supported by French arms. Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_AC.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_DownHigh.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply. With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built.

I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September.

We need to find a way of unlocking that money without the Executive,” she said.Ms Hargey has claimed that while the funding has been secured for the initiative, the approval of the wider Executive is required before it can progress to allocating funding for projects at specic grounds.Ms Hargey has blamed the DUP for the situation, claiming the party’s decision to pull Paul Givan out of the first minister’s role meant the stadia programme had to be placed on hold until a ing administration is back in place.The DUP has disputed this position and contrasted it with the minister’s insistence that the redevelopment of the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast can continue despite the Stormont crisis.On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: “The Minster has been clear that the .m to regenerate stadiums is ring fenced.“The Minister is absolutely committed to delivering this investment to support clubs and build first class facilities.“It is well known that options for the future of the sub regional stadia programme requires Executive approval.“The collapse of the Executive is preventing the regeneration of local stadiums.“The Minister is exploring all options available in the current situation.“Today the Minister held a meeting with representatives of the IFA and NIFL and agreed to work together to progress this project to the next stage.”In a statement released following that meeting with the Irish Football Association and the Northern Ireland Football League, Ms Hargey said that she had welcomed the chance to “reaffirm my commitment and intention to deliver this much needed scheme”.She said that she had told the two footballing bodies that she would work with them to “progress this project to the next stage”.Following that meeting, Northern Ireland Football League boss Gerard Lawlor said: “We held an open and frank discussion and we received assurances: the programme will proceed as planned, acknowledgment that an increase on the m is required and is being sought, and the programme remains a flagship project for the Executive.“Communication is key in the delivery of this programme going forward and I hope to see it delivered in a timely manner,” he said.The DUP has sought to portray the comments of Ms Hargey as a u-turn.The party’s deputy leader accused Ms Hargey of attempting to “play sectarian politics” with the issue.“The Minister has had two years to deliver the funding.“Indeed, last September she told us it was just weeks away,” Paula Bradley said.“It’s time for Minister Hargey to set her Sinn Fein political games to the side and get on with her job and deliver the funding.”Deirdre HargeyDUPSinn Fein  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWhat time will Storm Eunice hit  When and where will Storm Eunice hit -

The sister in law of dead PUP chief David, who has run Irish classes in loyalist east Belfast for years, said: “Great to see QUB providing the same type of residential scheme that is available in other UK universities.“It will be particularly beneficial for students from PUL backgrounds as often they have less opportunity to practise their language skills outside of the classroom.”MORE FROM THIS REPORTER:Click here: Lawsuits against the state from people interned in Northern Ireland  years ago now number up to Click here: RUC ‘collusive’ findings – WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’Click here: Catholic   Protestant quotas now in force in  new housing estates – with  more to come——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The next phase would be to transform a three-acre grass area beside the stadium into a G area for community use.The final phase of the vision is for an all-seater stadium with an international-size pitch accommodating between , and , spectators. Mr McKendry, who is vice president of the IFA and a board member of the Northern Ireland Football League, said: “It’s probably in the range of £, we’ve spent since last year in getting the place up to the standard that we are now at.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We do intend to do that through the [UK Government’s] ‘Levelling Up Fund’.“That in itself would give us a separate area where we could have all our youth groups, community groups, I don’t care who they are as long as the place is thriving, it’s vibrant, being utilised seven days a week.“That is always the aim of the club to bring the community into the area around the club. What it will do is regenerate the area of Coleraine which is an area of deprivation – that’s not me saying that, that is the statistics that are produced for Northern Ireland.”He added: “What we were looking for through the Sub Regional Stadia Programme was to create a North West Regional Stadium with state of the art training facilities and a community hub.“If you’re a team, say from Scotland, who doesn’t want to be going to Spain for pre-season training on an annual basis, Coleraine is right on your doorstep. There’s some great golf courses for a bit of rest and relaxation, great hotels – it all makes sense.”He said: “It was incredibly disappointing but not unexpected when the minister made the announcement.“I sincerely hope that we as a footballing family all come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“I would also strongly support engaging with the Gaelic community, I believe both communities need the facilities.“My thinking is that all the sporting communities should come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“It’s very disappointing that sport finds itself embroiled in a political situation, there are undoubtedly those who are using this is a political weapon, all they’re doing is depriving the youth and prosperity of all of society by their shortsightedness.”He added: “We’re proceeding with all our plans and hopefully further down the line after the election when there’s new candidates in, the money can be resurrected.”Intermediate club Bangor FC planned to use funding from the Department for Communities ill-fated stadia programme as part of the club’s push toto the Premiership.Largely based on cash from Deirdre Hargey’s department, the club – who have been absent from Northern Ireland’s top ision for more than  years – submitted a planning application for a new -seater grandstand and community hub.Bangor FC Chairman Graham Bailie said: “We are extremely disappointed about the news of the funding package for football stadia in Northern Ireland being shelved. “These funds were set to transform football club facilities across Northern Ireland. “A new modern grandstand and community hub are an essential step in the evolution of our plans to bring Premiership football back to Bangor FC. “Our ambition is to continue making progress on the pitch, and supporting the local community off it. “That is why we included a community hub at the heart of this project. “However, it was always dependent on securing a combination of public funds, from the Sub Regional Stadia Programme, and private investment opportunities.” He said the club now needs an answer to the question of whether the funding will now be available in the budget which spans  to . Mr Bailie said: “Bangor is one of the largest conurbations in Northern Ireland, and our continued vision is to upgrade the ground to match this position, as we progress through the leagues andto the Irish Premiership.”Despite the obvious setback, he said: “We need to keep trying to push forward, so as a board we are working through all other options which we think might be available. “The facility upgrade is needed in order for us to continue our progress.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Far from being worthwhile, they were harmful and disruptive.”He continued: “Given all the issues that came with vaccine passports and their lack of effectiveness, Labour should never have put them on the table in the first place.“Our focus now moves to securing commitments to the end of all Covid laws and forcing the LabourGovernment to end their focus on pet projects so Wales can get back on track and recover from the pandemic, evenLabour’s record suggests they will be incapable of doing so.”.remove.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Wales drops use of Covid passes at indoor and outdoor venues article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Speak to the coaches, the parents and children.“These kids are speaking to their friends who are saying I was training at Coleraine on the G or at The Showgrounds but we don’t have that luxury, we can’t even get a slot up there to hold a training session.“We don’t really want to take the kids out of Portrush and not everybody has a car and then we have to take into account the additional cost of travel for parents.“It is so frustrating that from  when I started to  we are still struggling with the same issue. We have kids coming from all over, from Bushmills and Portstewart as well as Portrush and people have had enough. Would you want your kids playing in conditions like this  I doubt it.”The DUP Causeway DEA councillors spoke of their commitment to help Portrush FC Youths adding that a meeting has been arranged with the club and council officials within the coming days which is the next stage of an ongoing process.Councillor Mark Fielding said: “I have been working with the club on ious issues since  and will continue assist them now and in the future.“It is quite obvious that there is issues to resolve with the current facilities in order to ensure that they are of a standard that meets the needs of the club and local people.”Fellow Causeway DUP Councillor John McAuley added: “Following contact this morning from Portrush FC Youth regards the condition of their facilities, I have had discussions with the club and council officers with a view to achieving short, medium and long term improvements. “I have been involved in local football now for nearly  years so I am well aware that winter training has and continues to cause many clubs a problem. “The good news is resolutions are possible and have been achieved in other areas of the borough in the past.“I am committed to giving Portrush FC Youths support to get the same outcomes for their facilities.East Londonderry MLA Maurice Bradley said: “I was in talks two years ago with council officers on behalf of the Coleraine and District League as part of the council’s consultation process into the borough’s pitch strategy. “As part of an overall strategy it was recognised that there was a lack of G facilities in the borough and Parker Avenue was in the mix along with other sites.“I would be happy to meet with Portrush Football Club and Portrush Youths at any time to discuss facilities. “I have been having meetings with council officers with the hope of having roll-on, roll-off goals at Parker Avenue and other grounds.“I believe that facilities are important, facilities allow clubs to grow and sports enthusiasts to improve. “But, in the short term, I would encourage members of Portrush Youths to lobby their local councillors.“Having been involved for many years in football and campaigning for better football facilities right across the old Coleraine Borough Council area, I support improving facilities for Portrush Youths and also for all clubs across the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council area.”Meanwhile, SDLP MLA Cara Hunter posted on the club’s social media that she would ‘be writing to the Department for Communities and Sport NI to identythere are any funds to resolve this ongoing issue.’When contacted, a spokesperson for Causeway Coast  Glens Council said: “The club’s designated training pitch was passed fit for purpose at the beginning of this week.“Council officers will visit the site today to assess the ground conditions and, in the interim, will engage with the club to offer an alternate venue.”The Local Democracy Reporting Service contacted other councillors, however, they had not responded at time of going to press.Read More Read MoreKillowen PS kids learn about ‘refill’Mark FieldingCara HunterPortrushBushmills  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularSports clubs in Portadown and Lurgan pay tribute to Davy Mat...NewsWeapons, drugs and £k in cash found during searches in Lur...News approached by male driver on Lurgan street\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime witness-appeal-after-girl-approached-by-male-driver- itm_sourceparsely-api\" approached by male driver on Lurgan street\" \"\" width\"\" approached by male driver on Lurgan street\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime witness-appeal-after-girl-approached-by-male-driver- itm_sourceparsely-api\"PSNI witness appeal: Girlapproached by male driver on ...NewsCourt hears ‘family feud’ allegation as Glenarm man has driv...NewsOmicron scam warning as public asked to fork out for test ki...NewsMost PopularAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock -

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_defbfecacaaeedead   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdebfcaaab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644937822558.jpg--covid_19___tue_15th_february_figures.jpg?164493782200","title":"covid  tue th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign.
