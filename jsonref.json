It came right out of the blue and he had been considering it for a few days. I just couldn\u0027t believe it.\u0027The couple also arranged another meeting with senior management at FirstPort in an attempt to iron out and build bridges following the bitter dispute but true reconciliation felt some way off for Geoff and Ruth.

It\u0027s was a free event to thank our friends for their support from Ruth and myself. It\u0027s been a very quiet Christmas... until they read this!\u0027The bid to oust the Scott\u0027s from their home stemmed from \u0027the envious wrath\u0027 of a cluster of residents who resented the 75-year-old\u0027s attempts to create an enjoyable social life in the sedate but stale block of flats which Geoffrey jokingly nicknamed \u0027God\u0027s waiting room,\u0027 shortly after moving into Pinewood Court in Bournemouth, Dorset in October 2013.Mr Scott said: \u0027It all began with a coach trip to Hampshire. It was such a success we went on to organise a mystery tour and we took about 20 of the neighbours on a holiday to Eastbourne. We have also run holidays to the Isle of Wight and to Torquay.\u0027After six months we organised more with the permission of Molly, who was the previous flats\u0027 manager. I have never asked for money for doing this - funds were raised through raffles and the like. Then suddenly, this group of six people took umbrage with me doing this.\u0027It was apparent that our fellow elderly residents were staying in their flats and not doing anything to pass the time, so we introduced card games and cake afternoons and bingo and even a fish and chip evening.          Geoffrey Scott (pictured above) had never imagined they would face a five-year campaign of jealousy to hound them out of their home\u0027All of a sudden people were energised and taking part - and really loving life a lot more. I was so pleased.\u0027However, the retirement resort\u0027s new lease of life quickly turned sour for the Scotts when the quiet crusade of the clique of embittered residents received \u0027legitimacy\u0027 from the new manager on her arrival six months ago.Mr Scott, a retired aircraft structure designer, said: \u0027Originally the new manager, started saying what a marvellous place she wanted to turn it into with holidays and coach trips. However, she appeared upset when she realised all of her ideas had already been introduced - by me.          Geoffrey Scott (pictured above) had tried to offer other residents more of a vibrant social life when he first moved to the residency \u0027We think she wanted to turn it into a care home! Pinewood Court is actually 42 flats with about 50 people living healthy, independent lives with ages ranging of 65 to 98 years.

She told me that this man said to her: \u0027I want to stab him in the back\u0027 - I didn\u0027t hear about this until four months ago.For Mr Scott, there was only one obvious reason why the group began their crusade against him simply for offering Pinewood Court a vibrant social life.He said: \u0027It was jealousy perhaps that they hadn\u0027t done it themselves, or perhaps they were jealous that someone came in and introduced all this stuff. But on the very first fish and chip evening I organised all these moaners came along and enjoyed it!\u0027But the five or six people started taking umbrage with others having fun. This went on until Molly retired about six months ago and the new manager and this group quickly became friends and turned her against me.One of the gentlemen in clique, I met in a lift. I held my hand out, and said let\u0027s call this a day, I don\u0027t like this atmosphere - and he totally snubbed me and walked away.\u0027\u0027These incidents escalated to the point where the building\u0027s management firm, FirstPort, contacted my landlady insisting she terminates our tenancy.

It was quite an eye-opener.\u0027The TV project which instigated this embroidery class is an eye-opener all round. Back In Time For School is effectively a big living history lesson. In the BBC show — based on a previous format where families undertook to live in homes from different historical periods — a group of teenage boys and girls are asked to turn back time with their schooling.Over six episodes, the 20 teenagers and four teachers, from schools across the Midlands, follow lessons just as children in the Victorian era would have done, then progress to Edwardian times, and so on, right up to the Nineties.          History lesson: Presenters Sara Cox and Polly Russell are keeping an eye over proceedings over the six episode seriesThe result? We now have a clutch of teenagers — and their teachers — who know what it felt like to walk the corridors in the shoes (and corsets, for the girls) of their great-grandparents, their grandparents and their parents.And what did it feel like? \u0027Uncomfortable,\u0027 says Adelaide, 15, who must be one of the few teens in Britain who has attempted to play tennis wearing a floor-length skirt and, yes, a corset. \u0027I couldn\u0027t breathe, never mind run for the ball,\u0027 she confesses. Her teacher has sympathy. \u0027We all had to wear Victorian dress, too,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027It had an impact in so many ways. When we were trying to sing, we couldn\u0027t take a deep enough breath. I am not sure I realised how restrictive that dress would be.\u0027Mind you, the teenagers were equally appalled to wear the flares and dungarees their ancestors might have worn in the Seventies and Eighties.          Old-school shot: The series was filmed in a Victorian-built school in Coventry, with the decor adjusted as the class moved through the ages\u0027I went home one night and told my mum about this disgusting denim skirt I\u0027d had to wear,\u0027 says Adelaide. \u0027She said \u0027Oh I had one like that.\u0027 \u0027The series was filmed in a Victorian-built school in Coventry, with the decor adjusted as the class moved through the ages. Uniforms, school meals and curriculums refected the era of the time.The first episode sees the boys and girls lining up to go into class. Before they can even enter the classroom, they must undergo \u0027inspection\u0027 of their hands, and behind their ears.Anyone with dirty fingernails is sent to wash them. Everyone is then given a spoonful of \u0027brimstone and treacle\u0027 to set them up for the day. Jamie, 15, dubbed it: \u0027The most disgusting thing I\u0027ve ever tasted.\u0027          Sara Cox will be the new presenter of the BBC Radio 2 Drivetime show, taking over from Simon Mayo and Jo WhileyMind you, the school dinners from that era came a close second.\u0027None of the kids coped well with the fish pie,\u0027 admits Sue. \u0027But what we teachers were astonished at was that there were oysters in it.\u0027Who ever thought of oysters in a school dinner? But they were cheap at the time.\u0027What happened when the tapioca pudding was brought out though? There were howls of: \u0027What is this frogspawn?\u0027 One girl declared it to be \u0027like Coco Pops in sick\u0027. But oddly, one boy, licking his lips, appreciated the fact that he was getting a free school dinner. \u0027It\u0027s better than paying £2.60 for a little panini that is just dry with very little filling,\u0027 he says, summing up his modern canteen experience.This is a glorious series, which flits between funny and downright disturbing. In the Victorian episode, the laughs come with the basics — the pupils trying to cope with ink wells. \u0027What a mess,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027They were covered in it. The desks were covered in it. They had an ink monitor who would go round filling up the tiny pots, and, of course, everywhere was swimming in it.\u0027Not much writing got done, the teenagers admit. \u0027I literally couldn\u0027t. I could not get a single word written,\u0027 says Adelaide.In the programme, one boy can\u0027t write anything for reasons other than lack of experience with a quill. He has his left hand tied behind his back, in keeping with the thinking of the time that being left handed meant one was closer to the devil.          This is a glorious series, which flits between funny and downright disturbing. In the Victorian episode, the laughs come with the basics — the pupils trying to cope with ink wellsMany of the children had not even heard of this nonsensical idea. \u0027It was completely alien to them,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027As it should be.\u0027So what were they actually learning in school in Victorian times?This is where the shocks come. The sexism is extraordinary. For starters, Sue — who in real life is the headteacher of a school in the Midlands — was not allowed to take the head teacher role, because the head teacher had to be a man. If these were sexist times, then they were also racist. In history, the children learn about the dominance of the British Empire. This is, in parts a stirring experience, one that gives them the chance to dress up and be in a triumphant march.\u0027There was a parade to celebrate Empire Day, and that was quite affecting for me because I had a grandmother who was born in 1904,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027You realise that we are talking about quite recent history.\u0027          Polly Elisabeth Russell is a food historian and curator at the British Library with responsibility for research on social science and food.This makes the more unpalatable parts all the more shocking. In one class, the pupils are asked to copy \u0027facts\u0027 the teacher writes on the board. The paragraph refers to Aborigines as \u0027savages\u0027, explaining that efforts have been made to \u0027tame\u0027 them, but unsuccessfully.It is racism literally writ large on the board, and the reaction of the pupils is one of stunned silence. \u0027I mean I knew that people had racist attitudes, but still. This is what they were taught, as fact,\u0027 says Adelaide.This is particularly apalling for the non-white teenagers, whose faces register the horror. One girl voices the reality many are thinking — that her own great-grandparents would have been taught that someone who had skin like hers should be thought of as a savage.Remarkably, perhaps, Adelaide says the lesson was helpful. \u0027I\u0027m almost grateful to have seen it written like that,\u0027 she says. \u0027It was shocking, but it made me realise how things were then, and why that racism was allowed to spread.\u0027Sue admits there was a lot of unease on the part of the teachers. \u0027That lesson on Empire will live with me for ever,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was horrible, horrendous. And as a teacher you are standing there thinking, \u0027I feel very uncomfortable about delivering this\u0027, but at the same time you know you have to be authentic. We can\u0027t rewrite history. This is what was being taught at the time, and it\u0027s important that we look at it and recognise the bits that are totally unpalatable to us now.\u0027Sue says there are lessons she learned about teaching, and how the curriculum has always been politicised. \u0027The boys were learning to shoot because of the Boer War not going as well as it might, and because of concerns about the Empire crumbling.          Sue says there are lessons she learned about teaching, and how the curriculum has always been politicised\u0027Even though I\u0027ve been in education for so long, I never stopped to think to what extent what we deliver in the classroom is dictated by national concerns.\u0027 There were certain eras that everyone involved agrees are best consigned to history. The Seventies episode sees the school turn into a \u0027free school\u0027 with liberal ideas about education. \u0027That did not work,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027Classes were optional and the children could choose whether they wanted to attend. It was a disaster.\u0027Interestingly, the pupils hated this decade, too. \u0027At first we thought \u0027Oh great, we don\u0027t have to go\u0027, but actually it was a nightmare because we were all bored, and it was a bit chaotic,\u0027 admits Jamie. Sue found the Eighties quite odd. \u0027That was when I was at school, so it was like stepping back into my own life. But it was also weird. And it was the era of the teachers\u0027 strikes. I hadn\u0027t thought of them from the teachers\u0027 point of view when I was at school.\u0027Technological advances are lived during the programme, rather than studied. The children watch the moon landings on huge TVs wheeled into the classroom. In the Eighties clunky computers appear.  These two mugshots reveal the Victorian crooks and child criminals who were locked up in jail on Christmas Day 146 years ago. Agnes Rose Flowers (left) was convicted of stealing a shirt worth two shillings six pence on the 16th December, 1872 while John Powers, 15, was convicted of stealing fabric The lack of their own handheld devices, though, throws up fascinating reactions. To be authentic, all devices — phones, iPads, laptops — were banned.Yet, the pupils seem to have thrived on it. \u0027It was one of the best parts,\u0027 says Adelaide. \u0027At first it was weird, but not being able to be on social media was actually quite liberating.

I am interested in fetish and the BDSM community. I went to a fetish party in Brighton a month ago for the first time and had never been to anything like that before.\u0027There were dungeon rooms, you can be ked and all sorts of things like that. There is a couples\u0027 room but we didn\u0027t go in there. We didn\u0027t participate at all.\u0027I went to the party on my third or fourth date with a guy. He made his outfit. He got his mum to make his out of leather.\u0027I wore a white corset with sparkles and a small skirt with stockings.\u0027One of the photos is featured on the Facebook page of Torture Garden, a fetish club that arranges events around the UK.Edwards, nee Elliot, admitted she enjoys sex and has found it difficult to find a man to keep up with her.\u0027I have a high sex drive.

She also sent him photos from the fetish event.The man, who asked not to be named, said: \u0027From the start of her meeting she made it very clear that she had a very high sex drive and enjoyed sex.\u0027To be honest I was a bit taken back with how direct she was, but she told me she wanted to make sure we were compatible before the date went any further.\u0027She made is very clear that she likes sex, and lots of it. She was very direct and told me she liked to attend fetish parties. I told her I had a high sex drive and she was happy to continue, but to be honest it was all a bit strange. She was intimidating.\u0027          The couple are pictured in a pub garden after landing back in Britain following their weddingEdwards sent her would be suitor two photographs taken at a fetish event.\u0027I was surprised to get them, but then she had talked about the fetish event.\u0027From the outset she made it very clear that she was into sex in a big way. She just brought up the subject right at the start of our conversation. I\u0027m pretty open minded, but she was so direct and made it clear what she liked and that was sex.\u0027She was a very confident person, but it was still a bit of shock to hear her talking like that when we had only just met. I\u0027ve been on a few dates from Bumble but never met someone who was so open.\u0027As if hearing that she liked fetish parties wasn\u0027t quite a shock she also told me that she liked to dress up much younger than her age. I wasn\u0027t too sure how young she meant, but she said she had friends who liked to pretend to be babies. She also talked about finding a \u0027daddy\u0027. I\u0027m not too sure what she meant, but didn\u0027t really want to ask her.\u0027I was a bit put off by this point as I wasn\u0027t took sure how young she liked to dress up, but she said she would sometimes talk in a young girl\u0027s voice.\u0027Edwards told her date she was still living with an ex-boyfriend but they did not have sex as he was asexual.\u0027She said his name was Paul and there was also another man called Paul who rented a room in their house. She said they no longer had sex.\u0027After spending just over three hours together Edwards and her date went their separate ways, but continued to send each other emails.\u0027I never saw her again, but as soon as I heard about a woman who married after meeting a date on Bumble I knew it would be her. She is a very adventurous person who would do something on the spur of the moment.\u0027I know we only had one date, but I think I had a lucky escape. Good luck to the guy who married her, I just hope he can keep up with her.\u0027The newly weds arrived back at Gatwick Airport on Sunday after their brief trip to the US – and are already planning to start a family.

Yes! Yes!\u0027And Sarah said: \u0027Paul and I both have very high sex drives, so it has been hard to find somebody who can keep up with that.\u0027We consumated our marriage on our wedding night - and it certainly lived up to expectations.\u0027She added: \u0027It was quite nice because if you have a traditional wedding, the bride and groom can be quite drunk by that time, but we weren\u0027t.\u0027It was a very special night and we discovered we are completely compatible in that way too.\u0027 And the new Mrs Edwards, who is excited to meet Paul\u0027s two teenage daughters, has revealed that they\u0027ve already discussed starting a family through IVF.   Sarah said: \u0027We share so many of the same values and passions, we are both ambitious and want to support each other to be the best we can be.\u0027We\u0027ve both said we want children in the future - it will have to be through IVF, but Paul and I already discussed that before the engagement.\u0027I am also very excited to meet Paul\u0027s two daughters - they will be my girls too now as you don\u0027t just marry a person, you marry into the family.\u0027Paul, who has two daughters, aged 13 and 15, is also looking forward to living with Sarah who he described as \u0027a beautiful, wonderful person.\u0027The happily-wed couple only spoke on the phone for the first time on December 22 - and the very next day they decided to get married.They met each other at Gatwick Airport on Christmas Eve - wearing their full wedding outfits - and boarded a plane to Las Vegas to get hitched.Paul, 36, even got down on one knee to pop the question at the airport with a £800 vintage diamond cluster ring.The lovebirds flew back into Gatwick on Sunday afternoon following their whirlwind wedding - and described their big day as \u0027perfect.\u0027Sarah and Paul said they held hands throughout their entire stay in Vegas where they wed in front of the famous Fountains of Bellagio.During their stay, the newlyweds explored Vegas, enjoyed a Cirque du Soleil show and went dancing in the resort\u0027s famous nightclubs.Sarah said: \u0027One thing I learned about Paul during the trip was that he is an amazing dancer because he just doesn\u0027t care. \u0027We had our first dance at a club in Vegas where we danced together until 3am.\u0027We didn\u0027t drink that much, but the next day I was feeling hungover and Paul went out to get me some water and a banana.\u0027 \u0027It was a very special night and we discovered we are completely compatible in that way too.\u0027 Paul, of Chichester, West Sussex, described the moment he met Sarah for the first time in person at Gatwick Airport on Christmas Eve.He said: \u0027I was panicky before meeting Sarah at the airport and I had to go to the pub to calm my nerves. Then Sarah said \u0027I am here\u0027 so I went to the check-in.\u0027I was looking left and right and then she poked her head around the pillar with a massive smile and I thought \u0027that is her, that is Sarah.\u0027\u0027During their 10-hour flight to Vegas, Sarah and Paul spoke throughout the entire journey.  The couple pictured meeting in public for the first time at Gatwick Airport (left) and with their luggage as they prepare to board a flight to Las VeasSarah said: \u0027We both agreed that if either of us were having doubts, we could just make this a fantastic holiday. But we both felt the connection and wanted to commit to one another for life.\u0027Now they are looking forward to \u0027married life\u0027 and plan to move in together immediately.They were heading to Brighton, East Sussex, for Paul to meet the first of Sarah\u0027s friends.And they will begin searching for rental properties in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, close to where Sarah works as a nanny and just an hour\u0027s drive from Paul\u0027s new electrician course.Sarah said: \u0027The wedding was so romantic - it was the perfect day.

Paul Thomas has made readers laugh at The Spectator, Private Eye, the Sunday Times, Punch Magazine, The Independent, Daily Telegraph and The Guardian\u0027Mac is an institution, utterly consistent and also a really friendly and kind man,\u0027 says Paul. \u0027It is an honour even to try to fill his enormous shoes.\u0027If anyone is qualified to do so, it is this man, with his detailed, witty and mischievous creations which brilliantly puncture pomposity and pretensions and skewer the extravagances and absurdities of life without ever stooping to cruelty or bullying.As with any topical cartoonist, he will never be off duty. Because ideas, for a cartoonist, are like jewels, or truffles even, to be foraged for, rootled out and hunted down, from newspapers, TV, radio, magazines, Parliament, and put to paper before their potency evaporatesSo Paul\u0027s life is immersed in current affairs. He wakes to Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, goes to bed listening to The World Tonight and leaves the BBC World Service playing by his bedside all night. \u0027This means I tend to find myself drifting in and out of very weird dreams about Theresa May and Brexit red lines!\u0027 he says.At least once during the night, he\u0027ll wake to jot down his thoughts — \u0027some garbled nonsense, often\u0027, either on a scrap of paper, envelope or mobile phone — to be deciphered in the morning. (He lives alone, before you ask how his wife can bear it).\u0027Last night, I wrote: \u0027Blair in lectern gag . . .\u0027 \u0027\u0027By the morning, if the note isn\u0027t easy to decode, then it probably wasn\u0027t any good as an idea. There\u0027s no point if it\u0027s not funny. It has to be funny.\u0027Paul wanted to be a cartoonist for as long as he can remember. As a boy growing up in Radlett, Herts, he was constantly scribbling, copying Nicholas Garland cartoons from his ironmonger father\u0027s Daily Telegraph and penning caricatures of his teachers.From the age of 11, he sent his work to Punch and Private Eye, and finally hit the mark with a cartoon inspired by an appearance by the Tory Ted Heath at a public meeting he attended with his father (a Conservative councillor) which was published by the local paper, the Borehamwood Post, when he was just 14.Paul wasn\u0027t paid for the drawing and he is at pains to point out that his father was friends with the paper\u0027s editor. But it was clearly good enough to go in. \u0027It was quite big, too,\u0027 he says, still glowing at the mention. \u0027On the back page!\u0027          During his stint at the Daily Express, he won the Cartoon Arts Trust\u0027s Cartoonist of the yearAfter that, he was drawing constantly — but mainly faces, always starting with the nose or eyes — \u0027you measure everything proportionately from there\u0027.After school, he did a foundation course at art college in St Albans before spending three years at Camberwell School of Art.He felt there was no market for cartoons, so he specialised in wood engraving (a form of illustration that is tiny, detailed and painstaking) but continued to scribble on the side, often rather rude cartoons of fellow students or send-ups of their end-of-year degree work. After graduation, he (unsuccessfully) toured numerous magazine offices before securing his first job at the Radio Times and, later, The Spectator.While many cartoonists focus solely on politics, Paul has more hinterland. An obsessive twitcher, he loves to draw birds.He is incredibly knowledgeable about all things ornithological and has just completed A Tabloid History Of Birdwatching, described by comedian Bill Bailey as \u0027an hilarious Who\u0027s Who of the twitcherati\u0027 through the ages.For Paul, 57, as for all cartoonists, the original idea is always the difficult part, while the execution — the drawing itself is, he says, \u0027like falling off a log\u0027.Each day, he\u0027ll prepare six drafts from which the editor will choose one for the next day\u0027s paper.Inevitably, as in any creative field, things sometimes don\u0027t go smoothly.\u0027Of course, some days you are funnier than others,\u0027 he says. \u0027But the nearer you get to the deadline, the adrenaline kicks in and there\u0027s always something there.\u0027The final version will take up to five hours to complete.As the cycle of news moves on, his cast of characters constantly changes.He adored drawing the singer Michael Jackson, but there\u0027s not much call for Jacko any more.Or the Queen\u0027s beloved corgis. \u0027All gone now.\u0027 Paul says. \u0027So sad. I used to love drawing them.\u0027Instead, he\u0027s had to brush up on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Duchess of Sussex and the wide-ranging cast of pro- and anti-Brexit politicians.\u0027Brexit is very good for a cartoonist — it just keeps on giving, but I\u0027m totally aware that people do get a bit bored of it.\u0027And with that, Paul grabs a pen and spends all of eight seconds penning another face — messy-haired, tired-looking, rather too craggy and lined around the mouth for comfort. Unmistakably, it\u0027s a cartoon of me.  Cartoons to make you chuckle in COLOUR!          \u0027Now pay attention, Mogg!

Taiwan\u0027s President Tsai Ing-wen has called on Beijing to respect \u0027freedom and democracy\u0027\u0027It\u0027s rather empty and doesn\u0027t have any new points except that cross-strait unification would not affect the interests of other countries,\u0027 said Fan Shih-ping, political analyst at National Taiwan Normal University, adding that Xi\u0027s words may also be intended for the US, which views Taiwan as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.In 2018, the US sent multiple ships through the Taiwan Strait -- which China considers its territory but the US and others see as international waters open to all -- infuriating Beijing.Washington also remains Taipei\u0027s most powerful unofficial ally and its main arms supplier despite switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.Xi\u0027s speech is likely to be \u0027very poorly received,\u0027 by the US, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, who studies Chinese foreign policy.To accommodate differences in Taiwan\u0027s political system and civil society, China has proposed adopting the \u0027one country, two systems\u0027 policy, which was implemented in Hong Kong after the British handed the city back to China in 1997.But some say the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong sets a negative precedent for Taiwan.\u0027They (China) are gobbling up Hong Kong, not just politically but culturally and economically too\u0027, Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker, told AFP.\u0027It\u0027s so obvious that they\u0027re trying to assimilate Hong Kong into wider mainland China in every way. How would any Taiwanese think that\u0027s going to work for them?\u0027Others believed Taiwanese could slowly come on board.\u0027People\u0027s heart won\u0027t change in one day, but I think one country, two systems is a way to do it. The unification might take one, two, or even three more generations to achieve,\u0027 said a 55-year old construction worker in Hong Kong who gave his surname as Lam.  Mid-term polls in 2018 delivered a massive defeat to Tsai\u0027s DPP, which has taken a hard line on relations with BeijingLast October, tens of thousands of Taiwan independence campaigners took to the streets in the first large-scale protest calling for an outright independence vote since the island first became a democracy more than 20 years ago.But some in Taiwan say worsening relations with Beijing have harmed business, as cuts to pensions and a reduction in public holidays compound frustrations over a stagnant economy where salaries have not kept up with the rise in cost of living.Last year, Taiwan\u0027s ruling party suffered a massive defeat in mid-term polls, causing Tsai to resign as leader of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, while the main opposition Kuomintang, which oversaw an unprecedented thaw with Beijing before Tsai took office in 2016, made gains.Beijing has adopted a multi-pronged approach to diminish Taiwan\u0027s presence on the international stage in recent years, including blocking it from global forums and poaching its dwindling number of official diplomatic allies."},{"url":null,"title":"Big Bang Theory star donates 5K family beloved LA news Chris Burrous","story":"Big Bang Theory Kunal Nayyar, 37, has donated $5,000 to the grieving family of Los Angeles news anchor Chris Burrous who died on December 27          The 37-year-old actor\u0027s donation is the largest contribution on the GoFundMe page set up to help the late news anchor\u0027s family.

Like many in the audiobook world, he believes this commercial success has coincided with a creative flourishing.He says the potential of book narration became apparent after his marathon recording of the English language version of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s acclaimed six-part book series, My Struggle.“Narrating these books was not only personally extraordinary, but at the vanguard of the evolving art of narration,” he told the .The completion of book six this year, for the New York-based Recorded Books, marks the end of a project that has taken five years to finish. The six volumes clock in at more than 133 hours, one of the the longest commercial recordings by a single narrator and almost twice as long as unabridged recordings of the Bible.Ballerini says recording My Struggle was the most difficult job in a 23-year acting career that has included roles in The Sopranos and the film Dinner Rush. Feedback from listeners highlighted how audiobooks, and the way they are consumed on smartphones, provide an intimate new way to reach audiences, he says. “The relation between narrator and listener has become much more personal. You’re in their home, lying in bed with them, in their cars, in the gym, or wherever it. It’s very one-on-one, there’s no sound or visual effects, it is just a voice in their heads.”He adds: “With the Karl Ove recordings people have written me in very personal ways about their experience of listening, which I’ve not gotten from any other project.”An artist told Ballerini she heard his voice in her paintings after listening to him reading Knausgaard as she worked. Another fan sent him pottery she said Ballerini’s recording had helped her to create. A couple who were stranded by snow for weeks said the My Struggle recordings helped them survive the winter.Some take issue with Ballerini’s description of it as a new art form. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has run a a talking books service for more than 80 years.Daryl Chapman, the studios manager at the RNIB, says: “I wouldn’t say narration is a new art form, rather one that’s been evolving over time.”Oral storytelling dates back to the earliest days of human language. “Cultures often venerated professional story tellers even though they weren’t generating new stories so much as re-telling the old ones,” says Joseph Devlin, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. Devlin’s research found listening to stories increased people’s emotional engagement more than watching video.“I agree with Ballerini that there is an intimacy in the audio format. As a listener you engage more by virtue of co-creating the content with the narrator.”Paul Stokes, the founder of the blog Audiobook Review, says: “In less than 10 years, the world of audiobooks has exploded. Using smartphones enables listeners, authors, and narrators to connect on many different levels.”He cites the example of Soundbooth Theatre, which runs live narrations based on YouTube requests, allowing audiences to have a say on how characters are read.Knausgaard approved the casting of Ballerini to read his books, but the two men have never met. “I was afraid meeting the man would shatter some things, and I’ve not even listened to him speak,” Ballerini says.But now that the project is complete, he is keen to meet someone he regards as “the author I was born to narrate”. Ballerini treasures a signed copy of book three of the series in which Knausgaard describes him as “my American voice”.Ballerini says he sometimes found it difficult to get out of character, when channelling Knausgaard. “I felt like it had gotten under my skin so deeply. It was like he was opening a window for me to see my own life. Maybe that’s the case with a lot of people, which is why the books are so compelling.”He says the experience of reading the 3,600 pages aloud was like “a big therapy session”, and admits to dreaming about Knausgaard and incidents in the books.Sarah Shrubb, an audio publisher at Little, Brown Book Group, says narrators often break down in tears reading aloud in the studio, especially when authors are reading their own work.“It’s incredibly difficult and you don’t have the feedback of an audience. It’s just you and the microphone creating these amazing soundscapes in your head. You have to play all of the characters and all their voices, and to be able to do them well is a real art form.”Shrubb says drama schools are beginning to take notice. “It is becoming an art form that is being taught in colleges. It is not just something actors do between jobs, it’s a career.”Ballerini acknowledges that his view of the status of audiobooks is an unusual one. “To describe an audiobook as being the largest thing of someone’s career is probably a new kind of claim,” he said. “But it is one that I stand by.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63b44528e03cb831538f0360c161a32ee176b3eb/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89aaf48684cccafd8903f219c3d13ff3","title":"gadgets the hardest thing to make now is a profit","story":"Be it smartwatches or smart speakers, it’s never been easier to make gadgets.

Out of Fitbit, GoPro, Parrot and Sonos – each operating in different parts of the consumer electronics business – only the latter made an operating profit in the last financial quarter, and all four have made a cumulative operating loss so far this year.That, together with the rise of a gigantic electronic manufacturing capability in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, about an hour’s drive north of Hong Kong, has made the modern hardware business one where only those with huge reserves of capital and brand recognition can hope to thrive. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony can probably rely on their brand name after that, it’s survival of the fittest.So is it already game over for GoPro and the rest? None is a newcomer. GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman, who wanted to capture better pictures of a surfing trip to Australia it came to market in June 2014. Sonos was also founded in 2002, focusing on multi-room high-quality sound, and came to the market earlier in 2018. Fitbit was set up in March 2007, and joined the stock market in June 2015. Parrot is the oldest of them all, founded in 1994 and has made many consumer electronics products, including a voice-recognition system (in 1995) and a Bluetooth-based hands-free kit for cars in 2000.Fitbit is struggling to move away from fitness bands – simple devices that record steps and calories burnt – where low-cost Chinese products are swamping the market. It is trying to shift into smartwatches, which are higher-priced, have more uses and generate higher customer loyalty. But it’s not easy in the first nine months of the year it sold 8.4m fitness bands – and 2.8m smartwatches. The opportunity is there: Fitbit has 25m users who pay a subscription to its services, and could be future smartwatch buyers. But in the most recent quarter it made a $200m (£157m) operating loss on sales of $940m and over the past eight quarters it has made a net loss of $624m. Its shares, which hit $47 soon after its IPO in 2015, are now $4.97.GoPro has managed to stabilise its unit sales, at about 1m per quarter, but profitability has remained elusive. So it is trying to encourage owners on to a subscription offering, at $5 per month so far 185,000 have signed up, generating about $11.1m a year. That’s about the same revenue as selling an extra 44,000 cameras – but the profit on subscriptions, as with software, is far higher than on the hardware. Its shares are currently at $4.24, down from $87 in 2014.“It’s harder for any company that focuses mainly on hardware to survive in the long term,” says Francisco Jeronimo, a smartphone analyst for the research group IDC. “But the big problem for many of these companies is that there isn’t a strong incentive to keep buying them. I might buy a GoPro, but I don’t need it on a daily basis if I have a smartphone. Same with Parrot – it’s a very niche segment. These companies were so eager to get to an IPO that they took advantage of the hype around their category, but haven’t been able to reinvent themselves, and they need to do that to keep alive.”The risk for such companies is that they are consigned to the virtual, or real, cupboard under the stairs to gather dust, while smartphone capability expands to take on functions that once needed a separate device.Yet it’s never been easier to make and sell hardware. Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide easy ways to find early adopters who will stake money on entrepreneurs with unproven designs, which can then be realised in Shenzhen. The Pebble smartwatch raised $10.3m as a Kickstarter project in 2012, then its biggest-ever fundraising it topped that in 2015, raising $20.3m for a newer model. Yet in December 2016 it announced it would close, citing financial trouble. (Fitbit bought its intellectual property – essentially, the smartwatch software – for $23m.) “Crowdfunding sites are great for attracting early adopters, but the majority of consumers don’t go there,” says Jeronimo. “It misleads companies into thinking their category is going to explode.”Even while it tried to expand beyond those early adopters, Pebble’s problem (which is now also Fitbit’s problem) was that Apple launched its own smartwatch in 2015, and quickly became the largest smartwatch maker. Sonos, similarly, found that a market it once had to itself – multi-room speakers streaming music and radio from the internet – turned into a jostling match with Amazon in 2014, followed by Google and most recently, Apple. Suddenly, everyone is making a “smart speaker”, and Sonos’s hardware-only model has come into sharp focus because it doesn’t have a native voice assistant (it is adding Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s ‘OK Google’).The ability for the big players to squash smaller players isn’t unique to hardware Facebook has tried to do it to rivals such as Snapchat. But in hardware, firms such as Sonos find themselves assaulted by both the big brands and the unheard-of ones leveraging Shenzhen and Amazon’s distribution.Sonos’s response has been to insist that people will move upmarket, to its better sound quality. It is also looking for collaborations, most notably with Ikea, whose fruits are promised in 2019. Patrick Spence, the Sonos CEO, is confident he can rely on the existing Sonos user base of 20m devices across 7.4m households.The squeeze on smaller hardware players has played out before, in PCs and smartphones. In the mid-1990s, the PC market was dominated by American companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway, Apple, Compaq, NCR, Packard Bell and Zenith. As manufacturing costs in the US rose, they shifted production to Taiwan, South Korea and, gradually, China – only to be usurped by local rivals using that manufacturing expertise and building international distribution networks. Now, only Dell, HP and Apple remain the three other biggest PC makers are Acer and Asus, of Taiwan, and China’s Lenovo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/506ac12be8473e8bb544ec21cda5dc6bc4c2dc51/0_92_2746_1648/master/2746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd6c4cc6ed91dccc34b6e6d5e42aced8","title":"stock markets dive china manufacturing contracts ftse wall street us economy business bleak start to 2019","story":"Australian dollar at risk of crashing below crucial 70 US cent mark as growth slows in SingaporeChina’s huge manufacturing sector has shrunk for the first time in 19 months, sending stock markets into a tailspin in an ominous start to 2019.The weak data released on Wednesday follows a slew of other disappointing figures from the world’s second largest economy and underline concerns that is heading for a tough 12 months.The Australian outlook was not helped by figures showing that house prices are now falling at their fastest rate for 10 years.In China, the CaixinMarkit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for December fell to 49.7, from 50.2 in November. A number below 50 represents a contraction. It was the first time it has shrunk for 19 months.Taiwan also saw a contraction in manufacturing in December while official data in Singapore showed that gross domestic product grew more slowly than forecast in the fourth quarter as the city-state’s manufacturing sector contracted on a quarterly basis.The Asia data made it more difficult for traders and investors to ignore what looks like “a genuine global economic slowdown”, said Australian market strategist Greg McKenna.“It’s still difficult to be strongly positive given all the uncertainties,” said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.With business conditions expected to get worse before they get better, China is expected to roll out more support measures in coming months on top of a raft of initiatives in 2018.“This data confirms our view that the economy is weak and that stimulus needs to arrive quickly,” said analysts at ING in a note.The position of the US Federal Reserve remains the key to market sentiment over the next 12 months, along with talks between the US and China to end their trade standoff.The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, signalled that there could be two more rate hikes this year, adding to the four he oversaw in 2018.But many market observers, not to mention Donald Trump, think that the US central bank risks sucking the life out of the booming US economy and emerging markets that are heavily geared to the US dollar.Federal Reserve fund futures have all but priced out any hike for this year and now imply a quarter-point cut by mid 2020. The treasury market also assumes the Fed is done and dusted with bond yields – a key indicator of real interest rates – now beginning to fall after rising during 2018.Powell will have the chance to comment on the economic outlook when he participates in a joint discussion with his predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke on Friday.Also looming is a closely-watched survey on US manufacturing due on Thursday, followed by the December payrolls report on Friday.“What is clear is that the global synchronised growth story that propelled risk assets higher has come to the end of its current run,” analysts at OCBC Bank wrote in a note.The pullback in the dollar and the chance of and end to US rate hikes have been boons for gold, which fetched $1,280.40 an ounce to be close to a six-month peak.Oil prices flagged again after a punishing 2018.

Economists had expected a slowdown to 52.5.The rise in the PMI level during December was mainly driven by stronger inflows of new business and a solid increase in stocks of purchases. Movements in both mainly reflected Brexit preparations by manufacturers and their clients. The European Central Bank has been busy celebrating 20 years of the euro this new year, but today it was forced to announce less pleasant news: Italian lender Banca Carige has been put in administration.Three temporary administrators and a three-member surveillance committee will take charge of Banca Carige and replace its board – who resigned en masse today.The plan will be a “temporary administration”, the ECB said. The bank last month failed to raise €400m in emergency cash for a rescue plan.Eurozone manufacturing activity has fallen back from boom time a year ago to “near stagnation” now, according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.December saw the third consecutive drop in new orders, in an onimous sign for the eurozone economy. Williamson said:The weakness of the recent survey data in fact raises the possibility that the goods producing sector could even act as a drag on the overall economy in the fourth quarter, representing a marked contrast to the growth surge seen this time last year.The last three months of 2018 saw manufacturers report the worst quarterly performance in terms of production since the second quarter of 2013.The eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 51.4 in December, the lowest since February 2016.There is likely to be little relief for European stocks from manufacturing figures, with IHS Markit’s barometer coming in at the consensus, but with a notably weak reading for future output.The forward-looking reading fell to its worst in six years.At the other end of the scale, there’s Debenhams.An interesting and unlikely top gainer amid a steep FTSE 100 sell-off: a British retailer.Retailers endured one of the worst years since the financial crisis in 2018, as Brexit uncertainties piled on top of fundamental changes to shoppers’ habits.However, Next has resisted the urge to pile up discounts in search of large volumes. Analysts are split as to whether the strategy will work, with some betting that performance over the crucial Christmas period will surprise on the upside.Next is due to update the market tomorrow.We seem to be set for a bad day across the eurozone as well – unless manufacturing data can give investors some cause for excitement.And it’s an unhappy new year from the FTSE 100 too, with more than 100 points knocked off at the open.Here’s more detail on what is already shaping up to be the big story of 2019: whether global growth is dragged back by a slowdown in China.Today’s Chinese data underline concerns that the world’s second largest economy is “heading for a tough 12 months”, writes Martin Farrer in his report.Japan’s markets were closed for a holiday, but the pain has been felt elsewhere, with other Asian markets in the red.Happy new year, and welcome to the first business live blog of 2019, with rolling coverage of the world economy, financial markets, the eurozone and business.Stock markets in Europe are set to start the year as they finished the last one – with a slump – following the lead of Asian markets which were under the cosh.The Caixin purchasing managers index (PMI) fell from 50.2 in November to 49.7 in December, below the 50 no-change mark for the first time since May 2017. New orders also fell, for the first time since June 2016.The data suggest there will be little let-up in the slowdown, according to Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics:The report implies deteriorating demand, with production likely to reflect that in coming months. Leading indicators suggest that activity is unlikely to begin a recovery until the second half.The fall in demand has been at least partly blamed on fears that the trade war between the US and China pursued by US President Donald Trump has started to hurt demand.However, trade war aside, markets could be boosted following signs that Trump may be willing to finally act to reopen the US government.Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: “News that Trump was reaching out to Congress to help end the partial government shutdown, provided some optimism to traders overnight.”The British and European manufacturing sectors will also be in the spotlight this morning, with PMI figures due this morning. In the UK economists are expecting a slight slowdown from the relatively strong expansion seen in November, when the index hit 53.1 – but for the index to show continued expansion in output."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/990ac35d4d6f2d2dd162fd4f31dd9ff64a92a923/0_20_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7160999bdc8dec6b8ef4b0063855f085","title":"turkey is kosovo controversy over balkan states new central mosque","story":"Pristina badly needs a new mosque – but Turkish attempts to court the young Balkan state with investment and advocacy is making some uneasyIt is six years since Islamic leaders and government officials laid the cornerstone of Pristina’s new central mosque – a slab of stone now hidden beneath weeds in a parking lot.Pulling back the weeds reveals it is covered with bright red graffiti – death threats to Kosovo’s chief mufti, along with the words: “No Turkish mosque or there will be blood.”There has been controversy over the design, including rejection of plans drawn by esteemed architects including Zaha Hadid in favour of a hulking carbon copy of any number of centuries-old, Ottoman-style mosques.But now it seems this spot in the city’s Dardania district will finally get its new mosque. Construction is to begin in spring.“In Europe they don’t have a single village without a church, but here in Kosovo are at least 50 villages without a mosque,” remarks chief mufti Naim Tërnava in his offices near the city’s Imperial Mosque. On Islamic holidays, the throng of worshippers at this Ottoman-era mosque, built in 1461, often spills on to the street outside. Tërnava is taken aback by the heated debate over Pristina’s new mosque – for him, it is a practical necessity, “for the worship of God, and nothing else”.Kosovo is still struggling to carve out a place for itself in a restive part of Europe amid poor economic prospects. The young state needs all the friends it can get.Among its suitors is Turkey, which has made huge investments there and been a firm advocate for its international recognition and eventual accession to Nato and the EU. As the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, put it in a 2013 visit to the country: “Turkey is Kosovo, and Kosovo is Turkey.”Those words resonate in a Turkey whose assertive foreign policy has been characterised as “neo-Ottomanism”. Kosovo plays no small role in Turkey’s imperial history: the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 saw the defeat of the medieval Kingdom of Serbia and the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of south-eastern Europe. The empire went on to rule Kosovo for nearly 500 years, bringing with it Islam and many other cultural influences.A large mosque wouldn’t seem out of place in Pristina, so why the controversy? When the then mayor of Pristina, Isa Mustafa, laid the foundation stone, land had already been donated by the local municipality. Mustafa went on to become Kosovo’s prime minister, a position he held until last year, but the mosque was never built.The city’s Islamic community claims it took a long time to select the winning design and make sure it would “fit the location”. Pristina’s municipal government dragged its feet in approving the mosque, but this year finally granted permission, subject to a construction permit.Opposition to many new mosques across Europe is rooted in fear of Islam, but with 19 of every 20 people here Muslim, resistance to Pristina’s new mosque does not fit neatly into that trend. Some locals resent what they see as a symbol of Turkey’s overbearing influence, while others are suspicious of the creeping return of faith to a secular, post-socialist public space. Among the project’s most vocal opponents are local architects. Even though the public tender stressed the need for an original building, the design chosen is classical Ottoman. The project is being overseen by the Turkish state’s directorate for religious affairs, Diyanet, which has built dozens of other mosques across the Islamic world in recent years, in a move some describe as a key vehicle of Turkey’s power play.“Over 30 designs were submitted just months after the call for designs was made in 2012. Even Zaha Hadid proposed a design,” says the architect Arbër Sadiki. “But before the competition closed, interviews started appearing in the press in which the mufti described what the new mosque would look like.“Designs were supposed to be original, but the chosen one is just a copy of an Ottoman mosque. The decision looks more political than architectural to me. I know amazing architects doing work on contemporary mosques in Turkey. Why can’t we put Pristina on the map with something similar?”Under Josip Tito’s Yugoslavia, Pristina’s old bazaar and many historical buildings in its Ottoman-era downtown were destroyed as part of a modernisation campaign that secularised public space. As a result, explains Sadiki, modern Pristina is mostly a postwar city, and little constructed since the 1970s has been distinctive. Pristina’s most notable building today is its modernist, domed national library, built in 1982.Pristina isn’t the only city in Kosovo where ostentatious Turkish-funded mosque construction has taken place. In Mitrovica, about 20 miles north, clashes in the 2000s led to the city’s ision into southern (Albanian and Muslim) and northern (Serb and Orthodox Christian) halves. The smaller northern district flaunts its Serb identity, with a new Orthodox cathedral and a much-photographed mural proclaiming “Kosovo is Serbia, Crimea is Russia”. The larger southern part of town is festooned with Albanian flags and monuments to fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army – as well as Kosovo’s largest mosque, which opened in 2014 and is named after the Istanbul district Bayrampaşa that funded its construction. Inside it is a riot of colour and ostentatiously Ottoman.There was no mosque like it in the city before – between 150 and 200 were destroyed in Kosovo during its vicious war of secession from Yugoslavia, many of them simple and modestly designed. For Mitrovica’s Muslims, the Bayrampaşa mosque is a symbol of redemption, if not reconciliation. Back in Pristina there is a sense Turkey has taken advantage of western disinterest to expand its influence in a place Ankara treats like part of its backyard.“People ask: why aren’t western investors coming here? Is it because we are Muslim? The sense is that the only door open to us leads to Turkey – and some want to walk through it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a0fea09cf4bb421265a60ddb0945435394e2be0/0_1_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=174ffebb1bb764727f9e9fc4204ab911","title":"belarus hope future europe democracy","story":"In a region that saw some of the worst 20th-century horrors, there is a yearning for democracy and dialogueIn December I travelled to Minsk for a seminar with a group of European historians. A few miles outside the capital of Belarus, we visited places where both the Nazis and Stalin’s secret police had committed some of the worst crimes of the 20th century. During those few days, I also spoke with some young locals who offered glimmers of hope as to what a truly united Europe could one day look like.It was the most instructive trip I’ve made in years: a deep e into conflicting European memories, highlighting the difficulty of overcoming stereotypes and ideological narratives, as well as the legacy of the cold war in people’s minds.It may sound odd, but for anyone trying to keep abreast of what Europe means, the best view could arguably be found right there, in those flatlands of marshes, pine trees and spruce, dotted with towns and villages on which the past weighs heavily.Minsk is, of course, outside the European Union, in a nation where a dictator rules, in something of a grey zone between Europe and Russia. Few people in western Europe know about Belarus, let alone have been there. Yet it should be prominent in our consciences. “Belarus was the worst place to be in world war two,” the historian Timothy Snyder once noted. In his book Bloodlands, Snyder recounts how 14 million people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in an area that stretches from the Baltic sea to the Black sea, with Belarus worst affected: a quarter of its population were killed as a result of both Stalin’s and Hitler’s policies.We ignore much about our continent’s history if we overlook the plight of this region, where the two totalitarian systems converged with horrific consequences – at once plotting together and competing as they laid claim to territory and exterminated those living there, or deported people there to die.Of all the places I’ve visited in Europe, nowhere is that complex history more poignant than in the forests outside Minsk, where three sites of mass carnage, only a few miles apart, are commemorated in very different ways.A fork in the road in Maly Trostenets is where tens of thousands of Jews, many from Germany and Austria, were shot over pits by SS commandos, their corpses later burned. Construction of a monument has recently started there, but strikingly it doesn’t indicate the victims’ names. This is because Belarusian officials are uneasy with commemorating the Holocaust – much as the Soviet authorities were. Instead, on trees nearby, families of victims have placed small yellow posters bearing the details of those who perished.Not far from there, in the forest of Kuropaty, lies a place where Stalin’s men shot thousands during the 1930s. Wooden crosses of Orthodox Christianity have been planted by Belarusian civil groups and opposition activists as a way of honouring the victims. But there again, no names. And there is no official monument at all. The cult of Stalin remains untouched in Belarus, much like it has been restored in Putin’s Russia.And a little further, in Khatyn, is a clearing in the forest where a village once stood. The Nazis massacred its entire population, pushing families into a barn and setting it on fire. They decimated hundreds of villages in Belarus this way. And here the full spectrum of Soviet‑era commemorations is deployed: a monument with names, a museum, tour guides. Khatyn symbolises the persecution of an entire nation – but it is an exclusive emblem, sitting alongside huge omissions. In Belarus the crimes of Stalinism are left largely untold, as are those perpetuated by the Nazis against the Jews.These places should rank prominently in our European minds, yet they don’t. Dealing with the full dimensions of what happened is hard enough for Belarusians dominated by autocracy and propaganda. But it is just as difficult for many of us elsewhere, because we tend to remember the 20th century from a western point of view, not from a fully continental perspective. The iron curtain, which lifted three decades ago, still lingers in our heads.Yet I took back another, much more uplifting message from this trip: young people I met privately shared their hopes of breaking down barriers and connecting with their generation in other parts of Europe. Far from our constant debates about populism, Brexit, Donald Trump and the EU’s struggles, they asked: “What do the young British want? Or the French?” “Do they worry like us about the environment?” “How can we share more with them?”In this part of Europe, which experienced the worst of 20th-century nightmares, I found signs of a positive energy, a striving for the basics of democracy and dialogue. It’s a quest no doubt hampered by a regime that likes to lock up dissidents. All the same, which energy seemed to want to burst out of the cold ground like budding flowers in spring. With crucial tests for Europe looming (not least the Brexit endgame, and European parliament elections in May), it was in Belarus that I found more reasons to hope than to wallow in gloom. I also came back more convinced than ever that Europe’s travails will only be addressed once we show a greater curiosity for other peoples’ memories.The historian Tony Judt once said: “Getting history right can require a new generation coming along.” He added: “There is probably a limit to how much you can break taboos.” It is at a human level, through exchanges, contacts, dialogue, and more awareness of history (especially in the media), that we can bring down some of those walls in our heads. Accepting differences, after shedding light on them, is surely as important to Europe’s future as trade deals or deficit targets. Walking down those frozen forest tracks in Belarus and discussing Europe with young people there felt like the start of a long road – one that holds promises, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3d83a464382028b6ca3d105dc3b95dbb64d6b5/0_310_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db8d63a2ce38f995a2973f5e70683be","title":"theresa may tv licence elderly","story":"The Tories pledged to protect free TV licences for the elderly in their 2017 election manifesto. Now they’re asking the BBC to override itImagine for a second the BBC taking a frail, housebound, elderly pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she has had for free. Then imagine fining her £1,000 – the standard penalty – with legal costs on top and if she doesn’t pay or can’t pay, sending her to prison.Unthinkable? In fact, one in every 10 court cases is over non-payment of TV licences. And from next year, millions of people aged over 75 could lose their right to a free TV licence – and, if they don’t pay up, end up being taken to court despite a Conservative election promise they would not have to pay.In a sheepish private message to the BBC a few days after their botched general election campaign of 2017, the Conservatives asked the corporation to simply ignore the fact that Theresa May had made a specific election promise to those millions of pensioners that they would continue to have a free TV licence. The Tories’ manifesto had stated: “We will maintain all other pensioner benefits including free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament.” The Conservatives told the BBC they had made a mistake by promising free licences until 2022, and insisted the BBC had the power to abandon them in 2020, thus overriding their election pledge. Even now, a year and a half on, the party has not levelled with the British public.In a paper a few weeks ago, the BBC had to admit it might charge all of those not on pension credit a licence fee – and thus restrict the free licence to 900,000 households, which would need to prove their eligibility. They might cut out nearly 2m households where someone from the age of 75 to 79 lives or start charging every one of the 4.5m households with someone over the age of 75.Just to means-test pensioners for their eligibility for free licences raises civil liberties issues. The Department for Work and Pensions would almost certainly have to open up its records to allow BBC officials to access private information on the finances of the over-75s. It would cost £72m simply to administer the system.But there are other very good reasons why the pensioners’ free TV licence should not be abolished. A policy of “taxation without representation” sparked the US war of independence in the 1770s. Since then the convention has been that taxation can be imposed only by the elected representatives of the people.But if the BBC – an unelected body – becomes the taxing authority, it will decide who is to be taxed for the licence fee, and at what rate.For the BBC to now make judgments that only parliament should make about the distribution of income between social groups is indeed taxation without representation.Of course there is a very good reason why the last Labour government and then the Conservatives promised a free licence to all over-75s regardless of income. Support for the welfare state is dependent on us feeling we are “all in this together”: that means combining targeted benefits such as the pension credit (which took 2 million pensioners out of poverty) with universal benefits that cover everyone. The free TV licence Labour introduced in 1999 is one of the few universal benefits available to all very elderly pensioners, and is particularly important given that for millions who live on their own the television is the best antidote to loneliness and isolation.Backed by an Age UK petition, Tom Watson, Labour’s culture spokesman, has made the case that if the BBC needs extra money, the government itself – not the broadcaster – should take responsibility for finding it. To do so is the only fair way of keeping its election promise.• Gordon Brown is the UN special envoy for global education and a former prime minister of the UKThe Age UK petition can be signed here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/501bd673da303ee8670cc255116012f60b9bbc3c/0_169_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=113abf292e1b0ea407fbce1da21751b7","title":"what does it mean to be a woman it is not just about femininity","story":"There’s a particular tightrope that trans women are made to walk, a kind of exaggerated version of the one all women areFrom as early as I can remember, I was told in no uncertain terms that things socially coded as feminine were off-limits for me. Assigned male at birth, the phrase “that’s not for boys” was one I heard with crushing regularity and the sense of shame and dysphoria – heightened discomfort about my body and identity – stuck around for a long time.I attended a Catholic, all-boys high school where toxic, teenage masculinity was inescapable, and I felt deeply uncomfortable about my relationship with maleness and masculinity throughout my adolescence, until I came out as a trans woman and began transitioning around 2012. I immediately felt more comfortable in my body, in my own skin. But something kind of funny happened when I began blurring the boundaries of what my identity could mean.Over the first year or two of my transition, I felt very supported in having a more feminine gender expression, and rarely experienced backlash from the outside world. However, I’d face a kind of resistance when I cut my hair short and wore a button-down shirt. My work colleagues couldn’t understand why I was “trying to look like a boy” – the subtext being, that I didn’t look like what they imagined a trans woman looked like. At one point, I experienced the peculiar street harassment of being asked why I was “trying to look like a boy when I was obviously a girl”. Given that, a relatively short time earlier, I’d received the same comments from a stranger in reverse, I had to laugh.While this kind of gender rigidity goes far beyond clothing and haircuts, it’s a useful metric for understanding my point. I began to realise how much society’s already-small acceptance of trans women was based on our willingness to perform a specific kind of femininity, enact these gendered expectations. I was a trans woman but not trans femme – a conundrum on top of a conundrum for society’s binary idea of what gender looks like.Ultimately, a patriarchal society punishes women, and in particular trans women, no matter what their proximity to femininity. It demands you stay within an extremely narrow set of boundaries for how you can present yourself – and straying too far away in either direction faces consequence.I think, then, that there’s a particular tightrope that trans women are made to walk, a kind of exaggerated version of the one all women are. Too feminine and we’re accused of feeding into stereotypes around women and femininity. Not feminine enough and well, why did we bother transitioning at all?It’s a reductive classification that leaves little space for the obvious fact that gender expression – for anyone – rarely if ever fits into a neat, defined box. There’s been significant progress in dispelling the notion that (cis) people have to conform to a stereotypical “ideal” of femininity or masculinity, but I don’t really see that given to trans people in the same way.At least part of this, I suspect, is the pressure often placed on trans people to appease a medical model of transition that can be very binary. I’ve had dozens of conversations with friends whose access to medical transition was contingent on their doctors being satisfied they “really wanted” to be the gender they said they were. The first psychiatrist I ever saw when I begun transitioning asked me in very plain terms – why was I transitioning if I didn’t want to wear a dress? Why wasn’t I attracted to men? He was asking me to fit within an extremely narrow definition of womanhood that I didn’t align with whatsoever.As far as I’m concerned, my relationship with masculinity as a trans woman has effectively changed from one imposed on me, to one that I have some level of agency over. It’s mine, and I own it whenever I make choices about the way I present myself to the world before I step out the front door. It’s empowering to take the gendered norms you had forced upon you as a young person and re-conceptualise, reclaim and subvert them in ways that are active, autonomous choices.I can understand why many trans women may want to completely detach themselves from masculinity. Having gendered norms forced upon you from birth can be an utterly traumatic experience, and I wouldn’t blame anyone who would want to remove themselves from that. But the idea that masculinity in and of itself is toxic doesn’t gel with my experience, and I hate the idea of trans people being given the freedom to identify how they wish yet forced to abide within arbitrary, pre-conceived limits of that identity.I want to see a representation of non-conforming gender that doesn’t force us to sit within arbitrary margins of what gender looks like. If all we’re doing as a society by existing outside of conventional gender norms is splitting ourselves into three discrete, rigid categories – women, men, and non-binary people – then that doesn’t seem like enough.I spent 21 odd years being told by the world the ways I could and could not present myself as I navigated my way through it. It makes little sense to me now that my body reflects the way I conceptualise my gender, that I would continue to let other people and internalized ideas dictate how I dress, or look, or act. Whether you’re trans or not – I don’t think you should either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a35338cc6e99c7abbd4aa71ededf8a618fa4bc8/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7283893bebf7146aba60361a97853726 1880w","title":"turning water into wine how did simple h2o become a luxury commodity","story":"From crystal infusions to water sommeliers and even bottling the frequency of rainbows, the top end of town has well and truly cashed in on the world’s most vital resourceOver the last few years, an unusual and conspicuous sight has become commonplace in the cafes and eateries of Sydney’s inner suburbs: Frequency H20 Alkaline Spring Water. The water, which costs AUD$3.30 per 1 litre bottle, proclaims to be infused with the sound, light and literal frequencies of three very abstract “flavours”: Love (528Hz), Lunar (210.42Hz) and Rainbow (430-770THz).Last year, Love became the first Australian water in nearly three decades to place first in the best bottled water category of the prestigious Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. Its creator, Sturt Hinton (not a typo he’s ironically named after the desert), meets me in his local vegan fish and chip shop. It’s one of 400 stores he personally delivers his product to whenever stocks run low.“It’s about lifting the spirits of the world, you know what I mean? And lifting my spirits,” he says. He was inspired to create Frequency H20 after a lengthy bout of crippling depression. “Just bringing delight to people, and it delivers this promise to consumers through having something so high quality and people can taste it. They can feel the difference. It’s clean, it’s light, they just love it. They love the idea. What a wonderful concept. Beautiful water.”The story of Frequency H20 was enough to pique the interest of Katy Perry (whose management requested it during her recent Witness tour), Paris Hilton (now following @frequencyh2o) and the Veronicas, who share their appreciation online with such vigour they could be unofficial brand ambassadors. Following this year’s Berkeley Springs victory, the Australian government at large even took note, with Austrade selecting it for the official Commonwealth Games showcase. Though he claims to have invested $100,000 in its development, Hinton is unwilling to discuss the unique device he claims he designed (“It’s not like Coke is going to give up their trade secret.”) that produces his water by harnessing “the incredible natural alchemy of energised molecules”. He does acknowledge this nebulous air of naturopathy is central to its appeal. That and the trending but increasingly dubious belief that alkaline water is better for you than regular tap water.In the luxury water business, a free good is repackaged and resold as aspirational. “I think it’s like the most marketable thing ever invented,” Hinton says.The core of this concept of “fine water” might seem like a new phenomenon, but in fact it dates back to the Roman empire, where certain aqueducts were preferred, or even considered ine, and natural carbonated water was imported from Germania in earthen jars. The industrial revolution would literally poison the well, as drinking water became a vector for diseases like typhus and cholera. The rich could afford to have unspoiled water delivered from remote sources poor people simply died until municipal chlorination in the early 20th century helped people live longer.Bottled or otherwise, there are now more people on earth consuming more water than ever before, and climate change just might be contributing to an increasing dearth of it with longer and more intense droughts.The story of water, then, is the story of the world – and the luxury industry is cashing in.Hinton’s frequency-infused industry darlings are just the tip of the iceberg. Some premium waters such as Svalbarði, sold locally for A$115 per 750ml bottle, are literally made from icebergs harvested on expeditions to the Arctic Ocean. Water bottles with crystals in them and crystal-infused water like that of Australia’s Madam Dry (A$49.99 per 12 pack) are trends within a trend, inspired by Instagram’s wilderness of “wellness”, the regimens of Miranda Kerr and there’s that naturopathy again: Madam Dry lists what astrological sign the moon was traveling through when “brewing” commenced. Premium, luxury or fine water has even co-opted much of the wine industry’s terminology – “varietal”, “mouthfeel” “terroir” – as well as introducing some of its own. “Total dissolved solids”, for instance, is a measurement scale unique to understanding why and how a water tastes and even feels the way it does. Water from the Fiji Islands, with its TDS of 222, is said to be smooth and velvety. Water like Vichy Catalan from Spain, with its TDS of 3054, is said to be extremely salty and complex.The phenomenon isn’t particularly new. In 2005, “water sommelier” Martin Riese caught the attention of the media when he created a water menu at Berlin’s First Floor restaurant after a guest complained about the taste of the water on offer. By 2008 he’d published Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Water) in 2010 he was certified by the German water trade association and in 2013 he landed in Los Angeles, after receiving an O-1 visa for his “extraordinary knowledge of water”.As the country’s first certified water sommelier, he launched a 45-page water menu at Ray’s \u0026amp Stark Bar. Two days later, he was a national curiosity, covered on Good Morning America, Fox News and CNN, and even interviewed by television science presenter Bill Nye. He opened a $100,000 bottle of water for a tasting with Diplo and 2Chainz. He appeared on late night host Conan O’Brien’s show in September 2013.“Pretty much every day, I have people rolling their eyes when they hear the words ‘water sommelier,’ and when I even tell them that I can match water to food, more eye-rolling starts,” Reiss says. But, he stresses, he is driven by a loftier goal. “I want to give value to water. When people understand that water is not just water, they might rethink their use of water.“Here in America, people do not even know anymore where the water is coming from. They think that a purified water is the same as spring water. Purified water finds mostly its origin in the municipal water system, so it’s actually tap water, which is already processed then filtered and with very small amounts of minerals added. The end product is a highly processed beverage from a factory. On the other hand, you have waters which are coming from a natural occurring source, like a spring, glacial, aquifer and so on. These waters are barely treated and you can actually taste the water’s origin. In wine terms, you would call it terroir.”There had been five schools around the world where it was possible to become a certified water sommelier: two in Germany (one being the prestigious and original Doemens), one in Italy, one in China and one in South Korea. On 1 August last year, Riese established a sixth in the United States with his business partner and Fine Water Society founder, Michael Mascha. They recently certified their first water sommelier in Myanmar after three months of online courses, a verbal examination and a final project.Mascha says most people in the industry would consider him an early catalyst for what the market now considers fine water. His own origin story has a familiar flavour: like Hinton, water saved him. In 2002, he says, his doctor told him “you can live or continue drinking alcohol”. He founded the Fine Water Society that same year, a sprawling, invite-only index of fine water from around the world that serves to define, explain and promote the ever-swelling industry.“The water we are drinking is actually older than our planet,” Mascha says – and that in-built cosmic intrigue lends itself to all kinds of stories.“We see a lot of claims around water. Microstructured, wetter, smaller molecules, alkalinity, frequency … those are all marketing messages created as there is no other story to tell,” he says. “There is no source or history to the water. It comes from a factory and the stories are made up to confuse.“Michael Pollan, a USA-based food writer, famously believes: ‘When it says “healthy” on the package, it is probably not.’ Great water,” Mascha continues, “comes from unspoiled sources and they are usually remote.”Jamal Qureshi’s Svalbarði water, for instance, is made of ice gathered from the glaciers in Kongsfjorden, part of the titular Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. That A$115 bottle might seem exorbitant to the layperson but it is far from the most expensive fine water on the market. That honour goes to Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani, a bottle of which sold for the jawdropping sum of £39,357 for 750ml in 2010, making it the most expensive bottle of water in the world according to Guinness, thanks in no small part to the bottle itself being 24-carat gold. Svalbarði, meanwhile, has drawn an incredible amount of attention to itself with a fable of production the envy of any winemaker.Qureshi stumbled over the Svalbard region when he was young and travelling obtaining water from it is “an extreme logistical and cost challenge” which he saw as marketing potential for a “brand that stands out to consumers”.“Having a bottle that could match the story and be worth a purchase almost in and of itself was also critical. People have a ‘wow’ moment when they see it. Then when they see pictures of the ice gathering it is always a second ‘wow’ moment.”Qureshi, who holds regular water tastings, explains that as with anything we put in our mouths, smell, taste and feel are vital. “Proper water should generally not have smell, which tends to be a sign of taint that is not good. Odourless is best. Mouthfeel is the other major component. From super light, airy, and smooth like Svalbarði, to creamy textures, to very mineral-heavy waters that start to almost have a tangible, ‘solid’ feel in the mouth. Carbonation obviously has a huge impact on mouthfeel as well, from very gentle bubbles to big and bold ones.”Qureshi sees a social responsibility in his work too.“We aren’t gathering sea ice,” he says of Svalbarði. “The icebergs are carved off of freshwater glaciers. Obviously we are gathering them from the sea and as such we are constantly reminded of the problems of rising sea levels and plastic pollution in particular.” Because of the latter, they use glass bottles because of the former, they are carbon neutral, and are “now going carbon negative, so that each bottle will help actually preserve a piece of the Arctic ice cap.”Qureshi recently moved his family from the States to Svalbard, close to where the whales now sing more deeply to hear each other over the noise of melting icebergs. “Living in Svalbard these issues have become very personal. I walk on the beach here in the middle-of-nowhere Arctic and pass by discarded plastic fishing nets that have washed in from the middle of the Atlantic. We live daily with freakishly warm temperatures, for this part of the world anyway, and I watch how the glacier fronts are retreating. I talk to old-timers and see their pictures of how the fjords used to freeze and no one could get a ship in here for five months in the winter. Now the local fjord hasn’t frozen in a decade and it rained this past January when it should have been -20C.”Water sommelier Reise also sees himself as an advocate for a vital resource. “By promoting fine water, I hope I can do my part to protect areas around the world and open people’s mind that water is so much more than just a commodity.” He cites his involvement with Viva Con Agua, a charity in Hamburg that seeks to improve drinking water in developing nations. “I fight for people who don’t have access to clean and safe drinking water. I hope I can spark conversations with my water menu about the topic of water in general. The more we know about water the more we will protect it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc8b8d41641b649f154cc725b09714428bde17e/0_303_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=405db6cd9b781039fec15928d83c5a71","title":"what to do in toronto in 2019","story":"Whether you’re into festivals, food, fashion or culture, Canada’s largest city is the perfect place to have fun at any time of yearSome say the name of Ontario’s capital city derives from the indigenous Huron word for “meeting place” – and Toronto’s ethnically erse population, combined with a smörgåsbord of big and bold events and festivals, as well as its hip neighbourhoods makes Canada’s largest city an ideal place to have fun at any time of the year.Here’s our season-by-season breakdown of must-not-miss events in this tantalising city …Ice-skating at Nathan Phillips Square is a not-to-be-missed experience during the festive season, and with tree-lighting ceremonies, Christmas markets and DJ skate nights along the waterfront, Toronto abounds with seasonal cheer in December, whether you soak up the winter wonderland atmosphere at gothic-style castle Casa Loma, or buy some gifts at the Distillery Historic District’s European-style medieval Christmas market.

Once a rowdy lumber town, it quietly developed into one of the country’s most handsome and liveable cities federal money backed impressive architecture and still supports a rash of top-flight national museums, while careful planning kept the city centre walkable and put the great outdoors a mere 15-minute drive away. There’s also a sizeable gastro and brewpub scene, along with a packed festival calendar. And there’s an appetite for some unusual activities too: how about the weekly mass drop-in yoga sessions on the parliament’s iconic lawns, or ice-skating the Rideau canal – the world’s largest rink – in the very centre of the city with a BeaverTail pastry in hand? See it for yourself …Food and drink form a big part of the Ottawa lifestyle. Farmers’ markets always bustle and hot new restaurants continually pop up around a city that already boasts the full range of choices, including dozens of ethnic eateries in districts such as Chinatown. Try the classic French cuisine at Sur Lie, or the innovative menus at Stofa. Elsewhere, the emphasis is often on casual and healthy, with modern vegetarian places such as Pure Kitchen as popular as any. Ottawa’s microbreweries all thrive too, with craft ales universally loved: the city’s beer festivals, such as the Winter Brewfest in February or the Ottawa Beerfest in June, burst at the seams brewery bus tours thrive and getting a table at a hip beer-focused restaurant, such as Bar Lupulus can be a challenge. Alongside the award-winning chefs and popular eateries is the much-loved BeaverTails pastry stand: its speciality is a huge doughnut flattened into the shape of a beaver’s tail then smothered with a topping. Barack Obama made sure he got one when he visited as president in 2009.Tours of Ottawa’s gothic parliament buildings are not to be missed you can visit both the House of Commons and the new Senate to observe democracy in action. The city’s national museums are another strongpoint, partly for their distinctly Canadian twist. From reconstructed polar environments to birch-bark canoes and contemporary art, all provide a wonderful window on the nation.The Canadian Museum of History has a particularly insightful glut of historical artefacts, including an extraordinary totem pole collection. For greater insights into today’s Canadian culture try the National Gallery of Canada, where airy contemporary art displays steal the show from old masters. Better still, take in a show at the dynamic National Arts Centre, whose bilingual performing arts programme includes all sorts of music, dance and theatre. Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot appears in November and the NAC English Theatre has highlights of Prince Hamlet, Angelique and The Pigeon King early next year.Ottawa has a reputation for a dramatic climate, based on temperatures that swing between –30C and +30C and, no matter the weather, the city excels at making the most of the outdoors all year round.An extraordinary 500-mile network of cycle paths, many groomed for skiing in winter, is a key asset and with many being attractive riverside affairs, getting about by bike is often the best way to see the city.Otherwise, the Gatineau Hills are the main destination for summer hiking and biking, while in winter they support one of Canada’s premier cross-country skiing networks, as well as good snowshoeing to remote cabins and some downhill skiing at Camp Fortune. All this is nicely rounded off by the Nordik Spa-Nature with its medley of rustic saunas, hot tubs, treatments and massages.Avoiding Ottawa’s January and February extremes might seem wise, but then you’d miss all the fun of the February Winterlude festival – a carnival of ice sculpting, canal skating and BeaverTail bingeing. Instead, don’t worry about the temperatures – Ottawa always seems to take the climate in its stride.Take to the river in the summer months you can go white-water rafting on the Ottawa River.

This year, Vancouver, BC, plays host at Rogers Arena, where traditional rivals Team Canada and Team USA remain the heavy favourites, with the young Swedes of Tre Kronor a close third. If that inspires you to lace up your own skates, check out the Robson Square Ice Rink, a beautifully lit, domed outdoor rink in the heart of Vancouver. An evening skate is popular with locals, and many of Van City’s best nocturnal snack options, including some top-notch food trucks, are close by. Skates can be hired for as little as Can$4 (£2.40).Curling: the Tim Hortons Brier – Brandon, Manitoba, 2-10 March 2019You can cut the tension with a broom at the Tim Hortons Brier where the country’s best male curlers have competed to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships since 1927. This year’s tournament takes place in friendly Brandon, Manitoba. The 2006 Olympic gold medallist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador was skipper of last year’s championship team and the eventual winner of the World Curling title. If you want to take a crack at some rock-hurling yourself, head down the highway to the historic Granite Curling Club in Winnipeg. Known as the “St Andrews of curling” for its contribution to the sport in Canada, this historic club has produced its fair share of Canadian curling royalty, including Victor Alvin “Vic” Peters.Snowboarding and freestyle skiing: Jamboree 2019 – Quebec City, Quebec, March 2019The 2019 International Ski Federation Snowboard and Freestyle Ski World Cups will be awarded at Jamboree, Quebec City’s annual extreme winter sports festival. Big Air, Slope Style and Half-Pipe are just a few of the categories up for grabs by competitors from across the globe. Not surprisingly, there’s no shortage of outdoor concerts and parties, which are also held at nearby Stoneham, Quebec. For your own snowboarding adventures, either stay put at Stoneham, which has 135 hectares (333 acres) of skiable terrain, or drive to nearby Mont-Sainte-Anne. Ideal for black diamond experts and beginners alike, Mont-Sainte-Anne features 71 trails covering 44 miles (71km) on three different sides of the mountain.RBC Canadian Open – Ancaster, Ontario, 3-9 June 2019The Canadian Open is the premier Professional Golfers’ Association tour event in Canada, and is one of the oldest golf tournaments in North America (it dates back to 1904). The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019. The race, which features top cyclists from across Canada, takes competitors through Canada’s “Garden City” and into nearby Metchosin, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. For a cycling experience that’s completely different, head north to the Yukon – the land of the midnight sun. Whitehorse’s 24 Hours of Light Festival, also held in June, is the only 24-hour mountain biking race in the world where lights are illegal riders rely on natural illumination instead.

There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I’ve seen in my four years living here,” Snider said.The 11th day of the partial government shutdown, amid rows over federal funding and immigration issues, has forced furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal government employees. This has left many parks without most of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds, enforce rules and otherwise keep parks running.Unlike shutdowns in some previous administrations, the Trump administration was leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs, said John Garder, the senior budget director of the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association.“We’re afraid that we’re going to start seeing significant damage to the natural resources in parks and potentially to historic and other cultural artifacts,” Garder said. “We’re concerned there’ll be impacts to visitors’ safety.”Spokespeople with the interior department did not respond to requests for comment.Jeremy Barnum, a National Park Service spokesman, had said as the shutdown took hold that “national parks will remain as accessible as possible while still following all applicable laws and procedures.” In practice, that has meant many park toilets were closed or filled to overflowing and acutely unable to deal with the larger crowds entering over the holiday period and taking advantage of the fact that many fees are not being charged during the shutdown. Campers at Joshua Tree national park in southern California’s deserts were reporting squabbles as different visitors laid claims to sites, with no rangers on hand to adjudicate, said Ethan Feltges, who operates the Coyote Corner gift shop outside Joshua Tree. Now all camping facilities in the park will be shut from noon on Wednesday, the authorities announced.Feltges and other business owners around Joshua Tree had stepped into the gap as much as possible, hauling trailers into the park to empty overflowing trash bins and sweeping and stocking restrooms that were still open, Feltges said.“The whole community has come together,” Feltges said. “Everyone loves the park. And there’s a lot of businesses that actually need the park.”Most visitors were being respectful of the desert wilderness and park facilities, Joshua Tree’s superintendent, David Smith, said in a statement.But some are seizing on the shortage of park staffers to drive off road illegally and otherwise damage the park, as well as relieving themselves in the open, a park statement said. Joshua Tree said it would begin closing some campgrounds for all but day use. Meanwhile, some visitors have strung Christmas lights in the protected Joshua trees, many of which are hundreds of years old, the Los Angeles Times reported.At Yosemite, Snider, the local resident, said crowds of visitors were driving into the park to take advantage of free admission, with only a few park rangers working and a limited number of restrooms open.Visitors were allowing their dogs to run off-leash in an area rich with bears and other wildlife, and scattering bags of garbage along the roads, Snider said.“You’re looking at Yosemite Falls and in front of you is plastic bottles and trash bags,” he said.In Yellowstone national park, private companies have picked up some of the maintenance normally done by federal workers. The contractors that operate park tours by snowmobile, buses and vans are grooming trails, hauling trash and replacing toilet paper at pit toilets and restrooms along their routes. The park is known for its geysers and delicate hot springs that are already notoriously vulnerable to human interference, as are Yellowstone’s bison, bears and other protected animals that have increasingly been threatened by humans getting too close.Nearly all roads inside Yellowstone are normally closed for winter, meaning most visitors at this time of the year access park attractions like the gigantic Old Faithful geyser or the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone valley using guides. Those guides are splitting the cost of grooming the trails used by their vehicles to keep their operations going, said Travis Watt, the general manager of See Yellowstone Alpen Guides based in West Yellowstone, Montana.Arches national park in Utah is closed because the federal shutdown means there no funds for snowplows and the roads are impassible, while Zion park further south has scaled back operations.There are reports of roads blocked by uncleared ice and trash causing three-hour tailbacks in Sequoia national park in California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a946512149eb7434b7a8dda436ecbbfd52c03f8c/0_788_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4729b8fd992defcda713d1e34f251817","title":"topshops decline marks the end of the high streets golden age","story":"The chain that democratised British fashion has lost out to Instagram and online retailers2018 was not a vintage year for fashion. The crisis-hit House of Fraser and an embattled Marks \u0026amp Spencer made headlines, as did a rising tally of planned store closures, and accompanying job losses, deemed necessary in a turnaround plan for New Look. The Orla Kiely brand, famed for its geometric prints, went into liquidation in September, while Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana ends the year under serious pressure, having been dropped by important retailers after a racism scandal shipwrecked a fashion show planned in China.But the most significant downfall to impact on the culture of fashion is that of a store still very much open for business. The undoing of Philip Green, and by association Topshop, is a watershed moment for British high street fashion.Hit by multiple accusations of bullying and sexual harassment, Green was further humiliated by being dropped by as a business partner by Beyoncé, who cut ties between her Ivy Park athleisure brand and Topshop after the allegations. The launch event for Topshop’s keynote partywear collection this season, a collaboration with the up and coming designer Michael Halpern, was cancelled at the last moment. There will be no star-studded parties celebrating Topshop’s place at the centre of the British fashion ecosystem this year, for the simple reason that it can no longer lay claim to that position.This decade has seen the young shoppers who are Topshop’s key market moving from bricks-and-mortar shopping, a field in which Topshop was dominant, to online, in which it faced stiff competition from new and nimble, social media-savvy, price-competitive brands such as Boohoo and Missguided. Furthermore, the BHS pension scandal of 2016 had cut into the personal fortune of Green and his wife, Tina, and forced him to step back from the limelight.The Topshop catwalk shows at which Green would position himself centre-stage, once a biannual sight at London fashion week, have been consigned to history. In his pomp, Green gave himself the prime paparazzi spot each season: next to Kendall Jenner in February 2014, Cara Delevingne in February 2015, Anna Wintour in September 2015, and Kate Moss in September 2017.In 2018, however, there were no Topshop catwalk shows at London fashion week. The programme of sponsoring catwalks for emerging designers, along with the lavish champagne-soaked hospitality that became a symbol of Green’s status, was already being pegged back by the beginning of this year.While few tears have been shed for Green, the decline of Topshop illustrates another shift in fashion: the end of a golden age of the high street. From the early 00s to the beginning of this decade, Topshop was the poster child for a fashion culture in which glamour and newness were democratised and made available to shoppers on a mass budget for the first time. Catwalk images had previously been a closely guarded secret in the months during which clothes shown at fashion week went into production, which meant high street retailers operated on a six-month time lag, unable to begin work on high street versions of the “new look” until the designer clothes went on sale.The internet changed all that. Images became immediately available, enabling savvy high street teams to interpret the trends and deliver them to suit their customers just as fast as Bond Street. Topshop – thanks to a talented and largely female team led by Jane Shepherdson – exploited this opportunity better than anyone else, delivering up to the minute, well-priced fashion.Green’s heavily stage-managed front row photo opportunities signified more than just the roarings of his rampant ego. Having Vogue cover girls attend a Topshop fashion show reflected a time when fashion’s class system appeared to have melted away.It was not to last. The latest hemlines, as decreed by the most chic designers in Paris or the colour-dominating catwalks in Milan, had once been thrilling plot twists that kept fashion customers hooked. Now that all of fashion’s secrets were out in the open, these plot twists – otherwise known as trends – lost their power over women’s shopping habits.Topshop’s cachet had been based on being the closest a high street shopper could get to catwalk fashion. But in making it accessible to all, Topshop helped devalue the currency of biannual trends, and the audience ebbed away to find excitement elsewhere – in street style, streetwear, or Instagram, in a new generation of social media-oriented brands.At the same time, a growing awareness of the conditions of workers producing fast fashion and of the environmental impact of throwaway styles dimmed the lustre of fashion as a playground for all. The current crisis has been brought about by a man of whom few are fond, but in its pomp Topshop was a shop millions of women adored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6faa86ac791450bc87bb83e0d8aecad9abef16/649_1245_5143_3086/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00cd703fb138d496639f74e53a064a54","title":"the stigmatised art of tattooing in japan in pictures","story":"The country’s ban on tattoos was lifted in 1948, but suspicion and their association with yakuza mobsters continues.

It feels like an especially fraught moment to contemplate the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose forthright liberal judgments have made her a pop culture legend. RBG is a documentary directed by Julie Cohen and Betsy West On the Basis of Sex is a feature starring Felicity Jones as RBG. RBG: 4 January On the Basis of Sex: 8 FebruaryDir: Catherine CorsiniThe fierce and passionate direction of Catherine Corsini is applied to this French melodrama of love and sexism, adapted from an autobiographical novel by Christine Angot. In the 1950s, a young secretary (Virginie Efira) has a passionate affair with a wealthy young man (Niels Schneider) she bears a child whom he refuses to acknowledge, so she must bring up their daughter alone.4 JanuaryDir: Jason ReitmanIt sounds so quaint in the brazen era of Donald Trump: the story of how, in 1988, the smoothly plausible Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart had all his hopes sunk by accusations of an extramarital affair. Hugh Jackman plays the presentable Hart, the estimable Vera Farmiga is his wife Oletha, and Sara Paxton is the other woman, Donna Rice, who endured the full misogynistic force of the press coverage.11 JanuaryDir: Wash WestmorelandKeira Knightley plays the great French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, who as a young woman in belle époque Paris was married to the notorious womaniser and rackety journalist Henry Gauthier-Villars (played here by Dominic West), who insisted on putting his name on the novels she wrote at first – and getting all the money. The director is Wash Westmoreland, who directed Still Alice he co-wrote the screenplay with his partner, the late Richard Glatzer.11 JanuaryDir: Jon S BairdSteve Coogan and John C Reilly give wonderfully observed performances as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in this sad, sweet, true-life movie about the British tour they undertook after the second world war, in dire need of money. They endure miserable digs, second-rate theatres, terrible weather and the fact that their local promoter seems more excited about a new young comic called Norman Wisdom.11 JanuaryDir: Felix Van GroeningenThere can hardly be anyone hotter right now than Timothée Chalamet here he plays a teenage meth abuser, Nic, whose addiction causes agony to his dad David, played by Steve Carell. The film is based on parallel father-and-son memoirs of this same experience.18 JanuaryDir: Josie RourkeScreenwriter Beau Willimon, an old hand at American political thrillers, transfers his skills to scripting English and Scottish history with this tale of Mary, Queen of Scots, played by Saoirse Ronan. Margot Robbie plays her nemesis, Queen Elizabeth I, and David Tennant is the gloweringly suspicious churchman John Knox. Read our interview with the film’s director, Josie Rourke.18 JanuaryDir: Clint EastwoodAt 88 years of age, Clint Eastwood is showing no signs of slowing down. He directs this film based on a startling true-life story, and also stars as Earl, a second world war veteran who, in 2011, was discovered by astonished law enforcement officials to be the oldest drug mule in America, smuggling substances over the border into the US. Bradley Cooper plays the cop on his case.25 JanuaryDir: Karyn KusamaNicole Kidman’s self-transformation in this brutally tough crime thriller has been much acclaimed on the festival circuit. She plays Erin Bell, an FBI agent who has lost it, psychologically and physically, after going deep undercover with mobsters, and cuts a tortured figure as her life falls apart. Now she gets the chance to reckon with the people who damaged her.25 JanuaryDir: Adam McKayThe former US vice-president, big oil nabob and waterboarding enthusiast Dick Cheney squats like a latex-inflated toad at the ear of power in this flashy political comedy from Adam McKay about the power behind the throne of George W Bush. It’s a scarily plausible impersonation from Christian Bale, whose bald-capped head has been enlarged to the size of a pale pink, bespectacled beachball. Amy Adams is on great form as Cheney’s formidable wife Lynne, with Sam Rockwell as Dubya and Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld..25 JanuaryDir: Marielle HellerWith a screenplay by that great and underrated film-maker Nicole Holofcener, this tragicomic true-life story of fakery looks mouthwatering.

What has happened?1 FebruaryDir: Sara Colangelo Maggie Gyllenhaal plays an unhappy woman in this American indie drama, remade from a 2014 film by Israeli director Nadav Lapid. She is naggingly unfulfilled in her family life and professional career as a teacher and then becomes obsessed with the idea that one of her kids is a genius.8 FebruaryDir: Barry JenkinsBarry Jenkins, whose Moonlight won the best picture Oscar two years ago, returns with this impassioned adaptation of the 1974 James Baldwin novel. It is a story of love and injustice in 1970s Harlem, when a young man is falsely accused of rape and his pregnant girlfriend has to prove his innocence.8 FebruaryDir: Ali Abbasi This bizarre Swedish film, adapted from a story by horror-fiction author John Ajvide Lindqvist, has comprehensively weirded out all who have seen it. A young customs officer has what amounts to a professional superpower: she can smell fear.

Brie Larson plays Carol Danvers, a former US air force fighter pilot whose DNA becomes fused with that of a Kree – a militaristic alien being – giving her superpowers.8 MarchDir: Alice RohrwacherOne of the most gorgeous and beguiling films on the festival circuit now gets a release. It is a lovely magic-realist fable set among an exploited peasant community who appear to be living in the 19th century – yet this is misleading. Among them is the happy idiot boy Lazzaro, who, like his namesake, is destined to be mysteriously reborn.15 MarchDir: Jordan PeeleJordan Peele’s satirical horror movie about racism, Get Out, made him a hot property, and now we have a movie about which little is known, other than that the director is calling it a “social-horror thriller”. It stars Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke and Elisabeth Moss.15 MarchDir: Lukas DhontThis is a much admired Belgian movie about trans issues – though it has been criticised for using a cisgender actor in the lead. Lara, played by Victor Polster, is a 15-year-old transitioning to female, yearning to be a ballerina, and facing incomprehension and transphobia along with all the other hurdles a dancer must endure.15 MarchDir: Carol MorleyHere is a movie straight out of left field: a metaphysical noir starring Patricia Clarkson as a tough New Orleans cop investigating the mysterious death of an astrophysicist – based on the Martin Amis novel Night Train. Director Carol Morley is such a restlessly creative film-maker. 22 MarchDir: Ralph FiennesDavid Hare scripts this handsomely appointed drama starring Oleg Ivenko as the young Rudolf Nureyev as he prepares to defect to the west in the early 60s, while remaining enigmatic about his exact motives. Real-life dance star Sergei Polunin plays his Kirov roommate, Yuri Soloviev.22 MarchDir: Adam ShankmanA cheeky gender-inverting remake of Nancy Meyers’s 2000 comedy What Women Want, which starred Mel Gibson as an adman who suddenly finds he can read women’s minds. Now it’s Taraji P Henson as a sports agent who gets the edge when she gains telepathic access to guys’ thought processes.22 MarchDir: Tim BurtonJust when you’d recovered from the tearful trauma of the 1941 Disney animated classic, there comes a new live-action version. Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito star.29 MarchDirs: Kevin Kölsch, Dennis WidmeyerStephen King’s brand identity in the horror world is as strong as ever, and here is the second movie version of his 1983 novel. It is the exquisitely horrible and obscene story of a doctor whose son is killed in an accident and who takes the corpse to the supernatural burial ground nearby – with grotesque results.5 AprilDir: Jacques AudiardFrench director Jacques Audiard has mastered the western with terrific elan. It is 1850s Oregon, and John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play quarrelsome brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters, who are on a mission to assassinate a certain inidual in San Francisco, and have to work with a prissy private detective, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.5 AprilDir: Paolo SorrentinoIt was only a matter of time before Paolo Sorrentino made a film about Silvio Berlusconi. Sorrentino’s longtime star Toni Servillo plays the Italian politician and media magnate, and the film is about Loro (that is: them), the group of hideously complicit businessmen and hangers-on who enabled his rule.12 AprilDir: Trevor Nunn Theatrical heavyweight Trevor Nunn makes a rare sortie into the movies for this period drama inspired by the life and times of the KGB’s veteran British spy Melita Norwood. Here she is transformed into “Red” Joan Stanley, and played as a young woman by Sophie Cookson and in later years by Judi Dench.19 AprilDir: Bo BurnhamA hyper-contemporary comedy-drama from first-time writer-director Bo Burnham (and veteran producer Scott Rudin) that has been much admired. It is about an eighth-grader (ie around 13 years old) who is obsessed with social media and keeps making self-help and self-esteem videos on YouTube which, by getting hardly any views, undermine her self-esteem.26 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c154f4cadc5c8276f9909cd98eaae530b5b625c9/664_1404_7102_4261/master/7102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=badfb68d9cbb86e7f474648adb07e1f6","title":"josie rourke interview mary queen of scots 2019 arts preview","story":"Starring Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie, Mary Queen of Scots is a historical epic with oral sex, menstruation and a erse cast – thanks to the director making a bold move from cutting-edge theatreJosie Rourke kicks off her heels and sums up her current punishing schedule with the words: “Bouts of talking about myself, punctuated by having my hair done.” We are in a grand London hotel, where Rourke is stationed to publicise her debut feature film. “The only point of reference I have for all this is Notting Hill,” she says, referring to the scene in the film where Hugh Grant sneaks into a similarly grand hotel and, after stumbling into a press junket, introduces himself as a reporter from Horse \u0026amp Houndand finds himself interviewing the cast of a sci-fi movie he hasn’t seen.All this highly controlled pizzazz contrasts comically with Rourke’s life as the artistic director of a small London theatre, the Donmar Warehouse, “where we walk to rehearsals and make our own tea”. The film is Mary Queen of Scots, which stars Saoirse Ronan in the title role directing it has wrought many changes for the 42-year-old, Salford-born Rourke – not least exchanging the familiar embrace of a 250-seat theatre for a drenched Scottish hillside. “I’d be trying to direct more actors than you can even fit into the Donmar while it rained horizontally into my ear. I remember feeling that there had to be a German compound noun for that feeling when fewer Highland cattle than you had booked actually turn up.”The film follows the relationship between the Scottish queen and Elizabeth I, played by Margot Robbie. This is well-worked dramatic territory, and Rourke’s film is full of the exquisite costumes, dramatic battle scenes and eye-catching locations one associates with historical films, including occasional bursts of over-the-top period campery for good measure, such as David Tennant’s lavishly bearded John Knox who rails furiously against the unnatural spectacle of a woman on the throne. That “whore of Babylon”, he thunders, that “false Queen”.In other ways, though, the film is startlingly unconventional. For a start, Rourke has imported from British theatre a principle still unfamiliar in cinema: colour-blind casting. Bess of Hardwick, for example, is played by Gemma Chan, while Thomas Randolph, Elizabeth’s agent at Mary’s court, is portrayed by Adrian Lester. This has not gone down well in certain quarters. “I sometimes feel,” says Rourke, “that people’s reaction to a person of colour in a film is more an index of their prejudices than about having a real issue with authenticity.”And anyway, she says, turning a story into a film is already an exercise in make-believe. “Representation is an act of the imagination. Margot Robbie is Australian. Saoirse Ronan is Irish. Jack Lowden is Scottish and is playing an English person, which was probably the weirdest thing for people on set.”Lester, she adds, was an obvious first choice to play a shrewd diplomatic go-between. “Adrian was Peter Brook’s Hamlet. He knows more about this period in history, because of his depth of experience as a classical actor, than anyone else did on that set, except for perhaps Simon Russell Beale, who turned up one day to read Mary’s death warrant. Because of his exquisite finesse and subtlety as an actor, he is better equipped to play an ambassador than anyone else I can think of. Why would you not harness that talent and knowledge?”The other departure from convention reflects Rourke’s feminist eye. Her film is based on My Heart Is My Own, a biography of Mary by Cambridge history don John Guy that attempts to rescue the Scottish Catholic queen from some of the more lurid claims made about her, some promoted by the English Protestant court.“What’s happened to Mary is that she’s got a bit stuck in Tate Britain,” says Rourke. “She’s a bit like one of those pre-Raphaelite paintings, of which I’m not a great fan, where she is kind of a prone victim who has either just been killed or is ready for sex. She has become either a femme fatale governed by sexual appetites, or someone who is too wilful to be competent. Elizabeth is usually set up as a counterpoint, portrayed as iron-willed, calculating. I don’t think any of those things are quite true.”Rourke attempts to present a more subtle story, not just about “strong women”, but about two people who were also “gigantically vulnerable, sometimes confused about what to do, trying to work out what the political landscape was, fighting for the rights of their own bodies – stuff that we do now that is sometimes missing from those narratives.”The film has much to say about bodies: about the queens’ different calculations about marriage and producing an heir about the violence done to women by men about sexual pleasure about physical closeness between women friends about clothing as a projection of power and desirability. When I last saw Rourke, several months previously, she had been arguing with producers over the edit. She wanted to include scenes that showed Mary having her period, and another that showed her being given oral sex.“I was fighting for a period in a period movie,” she says. “Those were instructive discussions about how honest we were being about women’s bodies and what they do, women’s pleasure and what that is, and a queen’s body as a political canvas. I felt that was something I hadn’t seen before, that I just really wanted to show. There are not many of us who know what it feels like to be a crowned head of Europe – but what we do know is what it’s like to fight for the rights of our bodies.”She got her way in the end: the scenes are still there. “We need to show this stuff. It does need normalising. A journalist asked me how hard it was to shoot the scene where Mary has her period, and my answer was, ‘Not hard at all!’ There were six women in that room, and it was probably the thing that just most easily staged itself. But it does continue to freak some people out.”As for the cunnilingus scene, Rourke did not employ an intimacy director – a safeguarding role increasingly being discussed in the performing arts. Rather, she worked with the choreographer Wayne McGregor, who was movement director for the film. “I don’t think I’ve ever done a sex scene without a movement director, without treating it as a piece of choreography,” she says. “I hope the sex scenes feel truthful and alive. To think in a language of movement helps remove embarrassment, discomfort or shame.”Rourke is still in a tiny minority as a woman director in the mainstream film industry. But she is optimistic that this will change – and quickly. She was in her mid-30s when she became artistic director of the Donmar in 2012. “My experience in theatre is that the door opened a crack and let a few of us in – and people just kept flowing through. It’s important that this film succeeds, not because I am desperate for it to succeed, but so they will let a few more women through. That is the pressure I feel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5c27c5f61874b0ae2a69867bfa0cdf44688ca2/0_2206_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=278f6a78aec392f9d9acc00e1bf06231","title":"nigel slater chicken schnitzel recipe","story":"Chicken breasts in a tasty breadcrumb coatCut 2 medium-sized leeks into 2cm-thick rounds.

Against this background, we have decided to accept an extremely lucrative bid by Chelsea, given the low contract maturity.“Christian Pulisic is a character perfect player.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3367bd99fb5519f379348f89b90e71fd40c8379/1090_737_5241_3145/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aefc31e73236fa45b23ef56550365a47","title":"how to get better at dating anything that doesnt involve late nights and alcohol is good","story":"After 18 months on the scene, I’m struggling to get anywhere. Can a love coach show me how it’s done?I once made the mistake of going on a Tinder date with an aspiring comedian. By the time our main courses arrived he had shared his full sexual history, including a graphic description of a foursome with some travellers he had met on a couchsurfing site. I had always assumed these were meant for people who needed a cheap place to stay, but apparently at least one doubles as a hook-up app for casual-sex enthusiasts who hate hotel room charges. Eventually, after a long speech on female independence, he told me that he only paid for dinner when the girl was “very attractive”, so I plotted my escape while we split the bill. I thought he would be happy to call it a night, but no such luck. As I scrambled to find an emergency Uber, he grabbed hold of my foot, asking if he could lick my “sexy” toes all night. I declined his offer and spent my journey home wondering if it’s possible to shower your own skin off.There have been plenty of other disappointing dates over the years, including Andy the monosyllabic advertising consultant, Will the food thief who wouldn’t let me finish a sentence, and a Greek racist who would only eat white dairy products. Other encounters have felt more like the icebreaker at a banking conference than the start of a Romeo and Juliet remake.We all know a bad workman blames his tools, so I decide to speak to my friends about my dating patterns. Never ones to hold back, they tell me that I am too judgmental, writing off good men for all the wrong reasons. Instead of giving someone a chance, I’ll leave after the first date because he can’t use apostrophes or doesn’t turn my stomach into a butterfly-filled frenzy of passion. They also tell me I’m too forgiving of narcissists and commitment-phobes, willing to make excuses for “complicated” blokes who frequently lose the ability to send text messages.Persia Lawson, dating coach and author of The Inner Fix, says that if you are repeatedly drawn to emotionally unavailable people, it is probably a defence mechanism. “People say they’re looking for a committed relationship, but when an available person comes along, they dismiss them due to lack of ‘spark’,” she explains. “In reality, they’re terrified of real commitment. There’s a sadomasochistic pleasure that comes with dating emotionally unavailable men.”As a dreamy flibbertigibbet who grew up with Disney movies as her primary source of spiritual guidance, it is tempting to wait for a prince to climb my hair and carry me off to an all-you-can-eat cheese restaurant. But instead of going 100mph or avoiding people who don’t take your breath away the second you meet, Persia recommends taking it slow. “Try rotational dating, where you meet different people for coffee, walks or a trip to the cinema or a museum. Anything that doesn’t involve late nights and alcohol is good, as drinking can influence your dating decisions in an unhealthy way and give you false confidence.”Her advice makes perfect sense. You wouldn’t expect to develop a close friendship overnight, so why do we expect so much from the people we date? Some of the best and most solid relationships develop over time, without instant infatuation to cloud your judgment.According to Lawson, it’s also important to be honest and avoid playing games. Provided you don’t turn up to a first date with wedding dress patterns and a list of possible names for your as-yet-unconceived child, there’s no reason you can’t be upfront about what you want.But when you have spent 15 years chasing players who have the emotional intelligence of a toothbrush, how do you change your ways and start choosing better men? Lawson says that rather than looking for the person I fancy the most, I should focus on shared values. “You need to have standards for yourself, but don’t be unrealistic or superficial. It doesn’t matter if a man isn’t three inches taller than you or a woman isn’t a certain weight. You can have preferences, but focusing on them too much is part of love avoidance and you keep people out by having strict specifications. The only thing you need to ask is how your date makes you feel about yourself as person. Do you feel comfortable? Do you share the same values? Do you want the same things?”Taking Lawson’s advice, I refresh my dating profile on Bumble and get swiping. After exchanging messages with a web developer called James, we agree to meet after work at a local pub. There will be booze involved, but I have set myself a deadline to come home at 9pm and finish some work. This also doubles as the perfect escape plan in case he turns out to be a homicidal maniac who collects human hair in jam jars. Although I have zero expectations, the date is a success and it is the most comfortable I have felt with a man in months. He is laid-back and has a good sense of humour, the kind of guy you could introduce to your friends without having to get them drunk first. When we say goodnight, he’s reserved and polite, a stark contrast to the men who have kissed me, declared their undying passion and then disappeared into the sunset in a cloud of sexy cologne. There was no instant chemistry, but we exchange a few messages the next day and he’s keen for us to have dinner together when we’re both free.In the meantime I arrange a coffee date with Luke, who works in advertising. Within the hour it’s clear that, while he’s a perfectly nice guy, there’s very little common ground and we don’t share the same sense of humour. I’m grateful I took Lawson’s advice to arrange a coffee date rather than dinner or drinks, where we might feel compelled to spend longer in each other’s company. We exchange a few messages afterwards, but it soon fizzles out.After a second successful date with James at an Indian restaurant, I arrange to meet up with an actor outside the V\u0026ampA museum. Usually I would be wary of flamboyant men, but he seems chatty and outgoing, totally different from the dry-humoured type of guy I usually go out with. I’m not sure if I fancy him, but I’m so impressed by his encyclopedic knowledge of Britney Spears albums that I am up for another date.The next week, James and I enjoy a few more PG get-togethers, before agreeing to meet up at the London Wetland Centre to see the otters. To his credit, he doesn’t complain when I insist we queue up in the cold for a good view at feeding time, and we spend the rest of the day sharing newly acquired trivia about mustelids. He also gets bonus points for not pretending to be with someone else when I jump up and down, squealing: “Look how cute the otters are!”I don’t know if my refreshed approach to dating will lead to happily ever after, but keeping an open mind is helping me to enjoy the process again. For now I’m ready to forget the fairytale myth and enjoy online dating for what it is: a chance to meet interesting people and explore new parts of town. If something doesn’t work out I will, in the wise words of Dory the fish, “just keep swimming” until I find what I’m looking for. Perhaps my Disney education wasn’t completely wasted after all.Some names have been changed.

The world’s largest entertainment group is banking on its content clout to help make its relatively late entry into the market a success. The AT\u0026ampT-owned WarnerMedia is also prepping a service that will include content from HBO, Turner and the Warner Bros film studio. WarnerMedia has not been as combative as Disney in pulling content from Netflix. But Netflix’s willingness to pay $100m (£78m) to keep Friends for one more year – at which point WarnerMedia will have to decide whether to keep it exclusively for its own service – highlights the value of crowd-pulling content and the problems Netflix could face if media companies reassess their content strategies. Netflix previously paid $30m a year for Friends, which has proven one of its biggest hits globally.“Netflix is facing increased competition from some of its previous content suppliers,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere Analysis. “Despite its major focus on original content the company is still hugely reliant on licensed content for subscribers and that carries risks.”Netflix will also be looking over its shoulder at Apple, which is widely expected to launch a global streaming service this year.Netflix built its reputation and audiences from expensive dramas, such as The Crown. It has recently started to focus on cheaper, yet popular, unscripted shows – snapping up the Channel 4 reality show The Circle to make it in multiple markets – with the Netflix CEO Reed Hastings highlighting the value of such fare. “Unscripted television has always been a hugely profitable sector,” says Lucas Green, head of content at Banijay Group, maker of shows including Survivor, Temptation Island and Wife Swap. “Drama has always got the headlines and red carpet treatment. Yet gameshows, quiz, reality TV, dating, baking and talent shows are highly returnable, faster to produce, more cost efficient and therefore lower risk. ”The company has been very bullish on the prospects of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly India. But Netflix’s pricing makes it a premium service compared with pay-TV and streaming rivals in many of these new markets and it may have to cut prices – meaning it will need more subscribers. Which rival will be the biggest threat to Netflix? Broughton reckons it is Amazon: “If I had to put my money somewhere it would have to be on Amazon. New players like Disney and WarnerMedia will need a lot of time and marketing to break into households, and who else will want to licence content to them? Amazon has the deepest pockets. Its catalogue is by far the largest, even if a lot of the content is quite old, and it has been exploring sports rights and other areas other players aren’t. ”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d272b80e3d728e8f8989318fc012fee6831ed98d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa9ab1115183e9065c612528052d4c44","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2019 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us cover Last year we published a piece detailing readers’ hopes for 2018’s  coverage, from continuing the fight against fossil fuel disinvestment to “making space for all things vegan”.We now want to hear what you would like us to report on in 2019.

In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the , is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities.Where has your head been at since the last album?I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn’t really have the same rock’n’roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I’d often book studios and there’d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn’t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.And you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn’t want to overanalyse what I had with him – it’s something much more pure, and something I didn’t need to explain to myself in a song.But on one new song, Love I’m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I’d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don’t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere – I’d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don’t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I’m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again.What else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with – I’m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can’t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I’d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn’t feel the need to be angry – so maybe that’s a good thing.One of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active we need to compensate for what’s going on in certain political situations. I know that “celebrities shouldn’t get involved in politics”, but it’s something we have to act on now. I can’t help but feel a bit frustrated that I’m the only one speaking out about something so important – no one else in my peer group is.The next step is electing people who take this seriously, and to trust scientists.

However, Corbyn is publicly lukewarm on the idea, and prompted dismay among some party activists last month by saying he expected Brexit to happen even if Labour won a snap election.Corbyn is facing intense pressure from some in the party to change course, with one pro-remain party group pushing for a motion that Labour would guarantee a referendum if there was a general election.The study, part of the Party Members Project led by Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, found that while Labour members still strongly supported their leader overall, they appear both distanced from his views on Brexit and, for some, sceptical about his motives on the subject.The findings “increase the pressure on Labour’s leader to get off the fence”, Bale said. “If Jeremy Corbyn genuinely believes, as he has repeatedly claimed, that the Labour party’s policy should reflect the wishes of its members rather than just its leaders, then he arguably has a funny way of showing it – at least when it comes to Brexit,” he said.Bale said Corbyn “does need to think carefully about whether his ambiguity on the issue is quite as cunningly clever as many commentators seem to believe”.He added: “It is because, if Corbyn carries on like this, then Labour risks losing some of the members on whom it’s relying to give it the activist edge over the Conservatives at the next general election.”A Labour spokesman said: “As unanimously agreed at Labour party conference, if Theresa May’s botched Brexit deal is voted down in parliament then a general election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference, if the Conservatives block a general election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17d718e06c7558f45b1df407e4b61ba14ad77a64/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa2f317b6f14a94c6bbe37d64993d2f0","title":"foundling museum london bedrooms exhibition highlights child poverty","story":"Bedrooms of London exhibition captures children’s spaces in bedsits and hostelsSome of them resemble cells while others are striking because of their lack of toys, space and privacy. All of them are children’s bedrooms, or at least the space they sleep in, exhibited in photographs displayed by the Foundling Museum, in London.More than 30 pictures by Katie Wilson expose the dispiritingly grim living conditions of families in poverty and form Bedrooms of London, an exhibition that could be one of the most challenging of 2019. “There is something very haunting about the images,” said Caro Howell, the director of the museum. “It is the absences, the absence of space for a child to walk in, or learn to walk in, or play in. The absence of toys, the absence of privacy. Because the people are not there, the environment is speaking for them, they are very haunting.”The photographs will be shown alongside first-hand narratives of the families. There is, for example, the tiny hostel bedsit of Amelie, a baby’s cot next to the mother’s sofabed and no room for the child to crawl then there is the story of Sainey, 32, who went to London aged 15 as a domestic slave, never left, and cannot work because she is in the country illegally and cannot afford clothes for her growing children.“Bedrooms are supposed to be a place of comfort and emotional safety and love,” said Howell. “A child’s bedroom is supposed to be a physical manifestation of the love that those surrounding it feel. Seeing the images brings you up short.”The project is the outcome of two years’ engagement with families by the the Childhood Trust, a London charity that is also producing a book and report to send to policymakers.The trust’s chief executive, Laurence Guinness, said some of the hostels in which people were forced to live were like open prisons. “It’s like you’re living in a cell. You can go out whenever you like but you’ve got no money to go and do anything. You can’t really escape, people are trapped.”When they set out on the project they assumed most children would have their own bedroom. “Even a child poverty charity can be naive about child poverty,” he said. “Those at the very bottom don’t even have a bedroom any more.”The exhibition will be at the museum which is dedicated to the history of the Foundling hospital, founded by Thomas Coram in 1739 as “a hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children”.Guinness said he hoped the photographs would be shown in parliament, where policymakers can take action.But while the families featured in the photographs were down, they were not out, he said. “We got them together recently to let people comment on the pictures and the report. They were very motivated to help.“The overriding question was: ‘How can this create any change?’ That’s all we’re interested in is change. We are not defeated yet.”• Bedrooms of London at the Foundling Museum, 8 February-5 May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df8a119ea73884b359c89b9800578624f6b0b644/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a3f7c5b5729439de34f0412ef652ce0","title":"the incredible story of pita taufatofua tongas shirtless olympic flag bearer","story":"Years of pain and crushing disappointment have not dissuaded the Instagram sensation from becoming an Olympian in two sports – and he’s about to announce a thirdWhen Pita Taufatofua began the walk towards the stadium at the 2016 Rio Olympics opening ceremony, he was an unknown, unrated athlete from an obscure Pacific island. He would walk back out a global celebrity. Had it not been for a vat of coconut oil and his flair for flag bearing, he could have passed through the Olympic Games unnoticed and unreported.As it was he went rogue, flagrantly disobeying officials who said “please just wear the suit”, hid a ta’ovala (Tongan mat which is wrapped around the waist) in his backback, nipped out the back and put it on just before the show got started, covered himself in oil, and by the time he had passed the thousands of people lining the streets on the way to the stadium he was going viral. When he stepped into the lights of the stadium waving his flag, articles were already being written about the distractingly shiny Tongan flag bearer and Twitter was melting down. “The internet came to a grinding halt,” reported Entertainment Tonight.Afterwards, when he was standing on the bus “in my oil”, things “just went crazy”, he recalls. “You look at your phone and you can’t keep up with it.”He was, he says, completely unprepared. There was no management, no sponsors, no money, no products, just him and his coach, Paul Sitapa. “It was the first time I heard about what a manager is, what a publicist is, what an agent is. It was just me and my coach trying to manage all this. Two people who didn’t know anything. No one had ever heard of Tonga. We were like, how is this even possible?”Taufatofua says he was just trying to represent his country by wearing its traditional costume. “I was representing 1,000 years of history. We didn’t have suits and ties when we traversed the Pacific Ocean.”If he is being disingenuous (his ancestors probably weren’t oiled up), if he was seeking attention, he got it. He now had the eyes of the world on him for his taekwondo tournament which was right at the end of the Games. “I had to try to stay focused. That was very hard. Now there was more pressure because everyone was watching. They wanted this guy out of nowhere who had this moment to win gold.” He was knocked out in the first round – 16-1 to the Iranian Sajjad Mardani – but it didn’t really matter because he had already won.By the end of the week there would be 230 million Google searches for “where is Tonga?”“Those were the stats that were given to us by Google trends,” he says.There would be appearances on US talk shows as he became a darling of the American media.And there would be a run at the 2018 Korean winter Olympics in another sport – cross-country skiing. He had barely even seen snow when he announced this, and it involves an even more dramatic story than the taekwondo tilt. But we will get to that.We meet in Suva where Taufatofua is on duty as the Unicef Pacific ambassador. He has just spent a day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Tonga and is here to appear on the reality TV show Pacific Island Food Revolution, which is being filmed at the Grand Pacific hotel. Taufatofua wishes the Unicef budget stretched to this luxurious hotel, but unfortunately it doesn’t.In person, Taufatofua, 34, is very far from his shirtless beefcake image. He is polite, well-spoken, an educated man with a degree in engineering from the University of Queensland, and a Christian who worked with homeless kids for 15 years at Brisbane Youth Service. The perfect teeth are fairly shiny and the now-famous torso is encased in a blue Unicef T-shirt. But man, does he have a story to tell. He had already won simply by getting to the Olympics. There was no overnight sensation about that. It had taken 15 years and a world of pain. “From memory, six broken bones, three torn ligaments, one-and-a-half years on crutches, three months in a wheelchair and just hundreds and hundreds of hours of physiotherapy,” he says.While he is humble, there is no mistaking the strength and self-belief that Taufatofua carries. That and the extraordinary perseverance comes, he says, from “getting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength. Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me.” Tenacity comes, he says, “from not having anything as a kid”.His mother, who is Australian, was a nurse and is now a sanitation consultant in the South Pacific his Tongan father has a PhD in agricultural science and worked in government research. He was born in Brisbane but went to school in Tonga. There were seven children and not much money a one-bedroom house, scarce electricity and no hot water. “They had no money because they paid for us to have the best education. Between us there are eight degrees and two masters.”In Tonga he was seen as physically smaller than anyone else. He was benched for the entire four years he played football, even though “I never missed a training session. I trained every day,” he says, The only time he got on to the field was to give the other footballers oranges and water. “The coaches never believed in me. In my head I was the little dog that barked and no one saw the little dog.”When he was five his mother put him into taekwondo for “self-defence, to look after myself. My whole family did it. My brother got his black belt”.When he was 12 the streets from the airport to town were lined with people cheering Paea Wolfgramm, the first Tongan to win an Olympic medal, a silver in boxing at Atlanta in 1996.“That was when I thought ‘I am going to the Olympics’. And it just never left,” Taufatofua recalls. “I was working full-time, studying full-time, I was training full-time. It was always ‘you will be an Olympian’. It is quite an interesting thing.”And so began the years of pain and crushing disappointment.Every four years there is one shot at the Olympics with a qualifying tournament. “I have to be number one in Oceania to qualify for Tonga.”In 2008 he went to the qualifier in New Caledonia and left in a wheelchair.He had been up one point when he sprained an ankle and fractured a bone in his foot, but kept fighting another two rounds until it burst. He was unable to walk for six months.There are no elite sports institutes for Tongan athletes, no vast reserves of government funds for Olympic dreams.In the darkest days he would draw on the homeless kids he worked with. “I saw just what true strength was. We had kids who had been abused in every way possible but were brave enough to get good outcomes. It was just a competition, I didn’t have the right not to believe in myself.”In 2011, getting ready for the London Olympics, he went to train with the taekwondo masters in South Korea, desperately short of funds. “We slept in a preschool for six months. We slept underneath the desk. Because it was a preschool for church they let us sleep there but in the morning we had to pack up our bags before the kids came in and then go out for the day. We had no money. It was as uncomfortable as anything.”At the world championship in Azerbaijan, which was an Olympic qualifier, he tore a knee ligament, normally a six-month injury. Eight weeks later, not wanting to wait another four years, he made it through to Oceania Olympic qualifier, fighting on one leg. “We wrapped it as thick as we could. I changed my stance. I fought all the way through to the final. Then I fought against a guy from Samoa who had beaten me before. I was beating him and then in the last round his coach had seen that I was only using one leg and he got up on me and beat me.” This time Taufatofua left New Caledonia on crutches, unable to walk for another three months, while the Samoan went to the Olympics.He kept competing across the Pacific, winning and losing, injury after injury. Surely people were telling him to stop punishing himself. “Doctors, lots of people, told me not to go on. It is really hard to describe just how clear it was in my mind that I will become an Olympian. There was a confidence there that I didn’t create, I believe it was God-given. I can’t explain it other than I just knew it would happen.”Up against a New Zealander who had consistently beaten him, the score was three all at the end of three rounds and went into golden points the first to get a point wins and becomes an Olympian. And he kicked at exactly the right time. “That was my moment. It was the most emotional time. Rio, oil, that wasn’t my moment – that was the reward for all the work.”Four months before the Olympics he was broke. He and Paul did fundraisers and rented a house in Brisbane. They trained in the garage to save money, yelling a lot. “I had my coach, we had prayer, I was happy, I had qualified, I was going,” he says.Perhaps it was all the attention, perhaps that kind of energy is addictive, but a few months after Rio he announced that he would attempt the Winter Olympics at Pyeongchang as a cross-country skier. As a person who had spent his entire life in the tropics, this seemed hilariously bonkers, up there with the Jamaican bobsledders. “I chose it because it made no sense,” he chuckles. “I love these challenges.”He watched YouTube videos of professional races and at 5am every morning he would put on rollerskis and train in the park. “The amount of concrete I ate. But I had one year to qualify,” he says. But then he had to qualify on actual snow. And it got real – on rented skis. “We had to get to all these countries to try and get the races. I think it was 15 countries in eight weeks. The problem was we had to go to races which were not the hardest races where the world cup winners would be, it would be too hard. At this stage every single athlete from every country was getting ready for the Olympics. I came last in four out of nine races.”He would run up $40,000 in credit card debt.By then he had buddied up with Chilean Yonathan Jesús Fernández and Mexican Germán Madrozo, whose prospects were as farcically bad as his were.None of the ski companies wanted Taufatofua to be seen on their skis. “I was asking for a good price and they looked at me and said ‘I suggest you wear other skis’. That happened through the whole qualification process, to me and my friends from South America.”In Poland a ski fell off and went flying down a hill and into trees. “I had to go down a hill I had already climbed up, spend 20 minutes looking for it, fix and tape it back on. They were shutting off the lights when I came in,” he recalls.He wasn’t even close to a qualifying time and he was running out of races.“I get across to Armenia. I thought it would be the last race. Two or three thousand metres up. Normally you go there two weeks before to acclimatise. We got there the day before. I got destroyed in the race again. I was devastated. There wasn’t any more time left to qualify.”They found out there was a race in Croatia the next day. But it would be almost impossible to get there in time.“We looked at every country around Armenia to get a flight. Every country around Croatia. I then end up in an eight-hour taxi ride through Armenia, through the Georgia border, with no sleep. I called the race officials and said I was coming in late. They said they could put me in at the end of the race and then I would start last. I fly across to Istanbul to get a flight to Croatia, and missed the gate by five minutes. I am there pressing all the buttons in the airport, maybe I was a bit crazy by that time. And it didn’t work. I am stuck in Turkey with no money and no flight out of there. I have missed the race in Croatia.”His brother, who is a lawyer, used his points to get him on a flight to London, where he lives.With four days left in the Olympic qualification period, they found out there was one more race – in Iceland on a fjord in the Arctic Circle. The three amigos bought one-way tickets to Reykjavik, Fernández and Madrozo flying from Armenia and Taufatofua going courtesy of his brother’s air miles.“We land, snowstorm. There is no flight from Reykjavik to Eskifjörður fjord. So we rented a car. Normally a 10-hour drive. But because of the snowstorm it took us three days,” he says.Then they heard that three avalanches had blocked the road. “I said, ‘Guys we are going to drive as far as we can and park the car and then hike.’ But by the time we got there they had cleared it, just.” Taufatofua went to the hotel and prayed. Tomorrow was going to be the last day to qualify. He only had one set of skis. “Norway has 40 pairs each. They have a $5m budget just for the waxing. If the conditions were hot or cold, dry or wet, you use a different ski. It just so happened that for what I had it was the perfect day. It was the one race I had where I felt the ski was the right ski. I did the race and qualified with five minutes to spare. And that is how I made my second Olympics.”Naturally he did the oiled shirtless thing at the opening ceremony, even though he risked hypothermia. This time there were no officials to stop him, he was the only athlete from Tonga. And by now the fame was not so accidental. “My goal was never to be famous because with it comes responsibilities. But what you can do with fame is another thing,” Taufatofua says.There was no question of a medal at these Olympics – “No way, not in that sport.” His main goal, he told the media, was “Finish before they turn the lights off. That’s number one. Don’t ski into a tree. That’s number two.”He didn’t even come last. He came in just under 23 minutes behind the gold medal winner Dario Cologna from Switzerland and waited at the finish line for his friends.Today there is something slightly messianic about Pita Taufatofua. “I always chose to learn from the pain and the failure,” he explains. “It is not special to me, it is something that is transferable to anyone if they have the right mindset. The alternative is to sit down and do nothing with your life and to always feel that there is something else that you should be doing. Everyone has potential. It is whether you act on it or not act on it.”He might never have won an Olympic medal, but Taufatofua has seized the constantly astonishing day. There is management, film and TV offers. He has given a speech at the United Nations general assembly and another at Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Justin Trudeau. He has written a motivation book, The Motivation Station, and another one on depression.“I have my faith and I believe my purpose is bigger than myself. If I am meant to help a million people have confidence, I don’t have the right to be depressed.” Taufatofua says he is too busy to be in a relationship: “I want to make sure that everything I give has to be the best. And I can’t give a relationship the best because I am moving around.”Now a serial Olympian, in late February he will announce his third attempt at an Olympic sport. It will be a water sport this time, but for the moment it is top secret.

It is set in the fictional kingdom of Agrabah, and was filmed in Wadi Rum in Jordan, where the protected desert landscape, sandstone and basalt mountains, canyons and otherworldly rock formations – such as Burdah Rock Bridge, one of the highest natural arches in the world – create a dramatic landscape.Exploring by 4x4 is recommended, and visitors can also stay in a Bedouin desert camp, go camel riding, and visit the 4,000-year-old rock drawings at Khazali Canyon. Booking directly with the Jordan visitor centre on arrival is advised, or with a tour company in advance (such as Jordan Tracks, 1 day 1 night, cameljeep tour from £90).• Released May 2019Quentin Tarantino’s ninth (and supposedly penultimate) film has a stellar cast including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino. Full details of the crime drama have yet to be unveiled, but last April the director told the CinemaCon convention: “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture, hippy revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, we’ll transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.”Photos and videos have surfaced showing a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, between Las Palmas and Cherokee, transformed with period cars, shop fronts and cinemas. But while most of the sets are temporary, it is possible to visit some permanent fixtures featured in the film, including Hollywood’s oldest restaurant, Musso \u0026amp Frank Grill, which opened in 1919 and whose reputation was set during the golden age of Hollywood, visited by stars such as Charlie Chaplin.Other Hollywood locations for reliving the retro vibe include Dan Tana’s Italian in West Hollywood, the city’s first late-night restaurant, where stars would dine in anonymity: it celebrated 50 years last year. Next to the art deco Pantages Theater, there’s Hollywood’s oldest e bar, Frolic Room (which originally opened as a speakeasy in 1930, was a bolthole for Barfly writer Charles Bukowski, and featured in LA Confidential). And the Hollywood Museum in the restored art deco Max Factor building, has tons of memorabilia and a historic pink lobby.• Released July 2019Almost 25 years after the animated classic hit the screens, a CGI version featuring the voices of Beyoncé, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Seth Rogen is being released. Research trips for the original animated film took place in Kenya’s Hell’s Gate national park in Kenya – though Pride Rock was a fictitious element added by the animators.Hell’s Gate national park,90km from Nairobi, is named for the intense geothermal activity within its boundaries. The spectacular landscape includes deep, twisting gorges, volcanic rock towers and plumes of steam. ABig cat numbers here are low, which means that, uniquely in Kenyan parks, pedestrians are allowed full access. But other wildlife is abundant, with more than 103 species of birds, buffalos, zebras, gazelles, hyenas, antelopes and baboons. Hire bikes and local guides (for hiking and walking safaris) are available at the entrance those wanting to explore by car can hire 4x4s at Nairobi airport). If a distant hyena lullaby sounds appealing, there are three campsites in the park (Endachata, Naiburta and Oldubai) and more options at nearby Lake Naivasha. • Released July 2019Jessie Buckley stars as a Glaswegian ex-con and single mum who dreams of breaking into the country music scene in Nashville. But Glasgow has its own Grand Ole Opry, a country and western club started in 1974 in a former cinema and still putting on gigs every Friday and Saturday. In March, the city, along with London and Dublin, will co-host Europe’s biggest country music festival C2C: Country to Country (8-10 March at SSE Hydro) with Keith Urban and Lyle Lovett on the bill. Glasgow is also a Unesco city of music, putting on more than 150 gigs a week in around 40 venues across the city. Music hotspots include King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Broadcast, Bloc+, SWG3, Stereo, Maggie Mays, and Mono, which is also a record store and vegan cafe.• Released April 2019The original film title – Everest – might have given a clue to the location of this animated film from DreamWorks. Although story details have yet to be disclosed, it is thought to follow a group from the streets of Shanghai who trek 3,000 miles to reunite the mythical Yeti with his family at the highest point on Earth, in the Himalayas.Since the first successful ascent to the summit of Everest in 1953, the Himalayas have become more accessible, with walking routes across Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, and varied options depending on season, budget and ability. Trekking in China more specifically includes a multitude of routes around Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan province, taking in deep ravines, snow-capped ranges, rivers, forests and remote rice terraces. Alternatively, there are routes at Sichuan’s Gongga Shan, the King of Mountains, passing glaciers, temples and views over the Tibetan meadows or in the far north-west of China in Kanas national park, in the Altai mountains that creep in from Siberia.Tours of the Himalayas in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, range from self-guided trekking suitable for families (World Expeditions, £990pp, 11 days B\u0026ampB), to trekking up to an altitude of 5,364 metres to Everest Base Camp (£1,740, 17 days, including all meals and accommodation).• Released September 2019Calanque de Méjean, an picturesque inlet near Marseille in southern France, was the location for this family drama by veteran director Robert Guédiguian. The tiny port beside the towering arches of a large viaduct sets the scene for the reunion of several siblings, who return to the family home when their father suffers a stroke.Guédiguian said Méjean had always reminded him of theatre: “The colourful little houses built into the hills seem to be no more than facades ... A viaduct overlooks them and its trains look like child’s toys the openness towards the sea transforms the horizon into a backdrop ... like painted canvases ... especially with the winter light, when everyone has gone. It becomes an abandoned set – melancholy and beautiful.”Méjean is one of several coastal hamlets along Provence’s Côte Bleue, with a picturesque railway route hugging the shore.• Released January 2019Another homecoming film, this time from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, following Laura (Penélope Cruz), who travels from Buenos Aires back to her childhood home in a village near Madrid to attend a wedding. Abduction, threats and former lovers (namely Paco, played by Javier Bardem) play out in this Spanish drama filmed in the village of Torrelaguna 40 miles from the capital.Torrelaguna has a beautiful traditional plaza, atmospheric 15th-century church, a Roman bridge, a 10th-century watchtower, and other historic buildings mixing gothic, baroque and neoclassical architectural styles. Restaurants serving Spanishspecialities include Alfoli de la Sal and Casa Moraleda there are horse riding and walking routes in the surrounding meadows and hills and the views from the nearby black-slate village of Patones de Arriba are worth a trip too.• Released March 2019Set in Port Isaac, Cornwall, this feelgood British comedy drama is based on the true story of a group of fishermen who were given a record deal after singing sea shanties in their local pub. On the Atlantic coast of north Cornwall, the tiny village of Port Isaac is a popular filming spot, already featuring in Poldark, Doc Martin and Saving Grace.During the making of Fisherman’s Friends, the original fishermen worked on the boats with the film crew, helped with singing coaching and consulted on accents and dialects. If visiting the area, expect a bit of a sing-song in the local pubs, or during the summer (depending on the weather) you might be lucky enough to catch the Fisherman’s Friends giving a performance of sea shanties on the platt (dock). These shows are free, with donations going to charity. There are boat and fishing trips from the port depending on weather and season, and Polzeath beach, one of the best surfing spots in north Cornwall, is five miles away.• Released March 2019 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

A growly voiceover explained that the ancient Britons had fought an enemy so terrible that his conquered corpse had been sliced in three, and the portions stored around the world, starting at a Pacific island and a Siberian freezescape.I made a mental bet that the rest of the super-warrior would be found under Sheffield, which turned out to be the case. After only 11 episodes in charge, Chibnall is already growing his own in-jokes. As well as audibly coming from Yorkshire, Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor is returned there at every possibility. So the squid-like innards of a Dalek, usually hidden within that man-sized pepper mill on castors, were inevitably dug up by archaeologists working in the S1 postcode.As well as making the series more Earthbound, especially around the West Riding, another mark of Chibnall’s tenancy has been topical commentary. The first season was explicitly pro-ecology and anti-Trump, and implicitly anti-Brexit.So liberal-friendly has the show been, it was a surprise in this special that the Dalekian inner jelly didn’t turn out to be called Jacob Rees-Blob, or that when the extraterrestrial glop was enclosed in a plastic bag, it wasn’t the packaging that proved to be the biggest threat to the planet.With 88 days to go until the UK is supposed to leave the EU, however, there was one pointed political reference. When the Doctor tried to call on the cross-border Unified Intelligence Taskforce to help save Sheffield from extermination, she learned that Britain was no longer a member after falling out with her “major international partners”. Another satirical gag was aimed at the cross-planetary force threatening to exterminate the BBC.When the Daleks broke the internet, a mother warned her children that no entertainment was available. “Not even Netflix?” pleaded a child. But no, even that modern superpower could not defy the croaky rollers.Presumably coincidentally, the overall theme overlapped with this year’s Queen’s Christmas message by stressing the need for national and community unity. The final scoreline was: United Sheffield 1, Daleks 0.Another Chibnall signature was entwining the extraterrestrial with the domestic. The absence of Bradley Walsh’s doctorial sidekick Graham from one key Tardis mission was so odd that you initially assumed a filming clash with The Chase, but it transpired that the character had been grounded in order to discuss responsible parenting with guest actor Daniel Adegboyega, as the absentee dad of sidekick Ryan (Tosin Cole).Having shown in Broadchurch an exceptional skill at writing family dynamics, Chibnall now extends this exploration into the broadest church of all – the universe. The show ended with a parent-child hug.That interaction poignantly wasn’t open to the main character, in a performance that gave us a bonus extra day of some of the best TV acting of 2018. Between intermittent radiant smiles and sharp one-liners, Whittaker’s dominant note in the role is a sense of lonely responsibility – carrying the cares of the solar system on her shoulders – which the scripts keep underlining.Preparing to face down the Daleks again, she is warned, “You can’t do it alone!”, but shrugs: “Always have done.” When an Earthling notes that dads are complicated, the Doctor ruefully replies: “So I’m told.” She is parentless, childless, partnerless, but everyone needs her.This Doctor feels like the world leader we want for these times. Sadly, though, she won’t be on screen again until 2020, the producers having asked to make the next episodes slowly. Quality control is the reason for the delay, and the classiness of this first series finale gives Chibnall a high bar to beat, but ensures that viewers will want to watch him try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69f470584e325d4ca8fd0f8967ad16a292ccd507/0_0_2071_1243/master/2071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a872733f80e10119d9729f7633b908d2","title":"eastenders first gay bar albert square","story":"Senior executive producer Kate Oates wants soap to better reflect London’s ersityAlbert Square could soon have an alternative nightspot to the Queen Vic after EastEnders announced plans for the soap’s first gay bar.More than three decades after the show became the first to feature a homosexual kiss on primetime television, EastEnders’ senior executive producer said she wants it to do a better job at reflecting London’s ersity.Kate Oates, who recently joined from Coronation Street, said: “I am …really interested in bringing some more LGBTQ characters in, and maybe we will have a new precinct for them as well.“We are looking at opening a gay bar on the square, which will be a super-cool precinct where gay and straight characters can all just hang out and loads of stories can cross and should just be something really exciting, really fun, really visual and feel really true to multicultural London.“Hopefully that will be something exciting for the next year.”The storyline is likely to prove far less controversial than the first gay kiss, in 1987, between Colin Russell – played by Michael Cashman, now a Labour peer – and Barry Clark (Gary Hailes). The kiss was a peck by Clark on the forehead of Russell and it was another two years before the first mouth-to-mouth kiss, featuring Russell and Guido Smith, played by Nicholas Donovan, but both scenes were criticised at the time.The Sun called the soap “EastBenders” after the latter kiss and fumed about “a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs … when millions of children were watching”. Questions were asked in parliament about the appropriateness of such scenes.Oates has previously credited those kisses, plus the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss, between Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson on Brookside in 1994, as helping to change society.While times have changed, there were still more than 100 complaints when the show featured a kiss between Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and Lee Thompson (Carl Ferguson) in 2008.Oates discussed the prospect of a gay bar in a video on Twitter, responding to viewers’ questions. She said the show was committed to championing ersity by having a cast list that reflected “multicultural London”. To that end, she also announced there would be two new characters in the Ahmed family, Habiba and Iqra, plus the return of another BAME character, Mitch Baker, whose daughter Chantelle will also feature.Oates was credited with introducing storylines about difficult issues when she was a producer at Coronation Street, including grooming and male rape. They proved controversial with some but helped the soap attain its highest ratings in years.EastEnders’ New Year’s Eve episode featured Bernie Taylor (Clair Norris) telling her mother, Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley): “I think I’m in love ... with a girl.”Ironically, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and his “night tsar”, Amy Lamé, are battling the decline of LGBT bars in the capital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf3dbada93a7283aba62dbb115ffae7d090fc8d/0_132_3951_2371/master/3951.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d15e2178a1804803f7c19f2d2dc6b8","title":"luther review the maverick the minion and the pincushion","story":"The solid old-fashioned whodunnit kicked off its fifth series with some organised crime and disorganised serial-killingLuther’s back! Still massive, still maverick. Still with a coat half a size too small for him. Still walking like someone only recently introduced to the concept of ambulation. Maybe that is because of the coat? If you can’t move your shoulders properly, your whole technique’s off. I can’t tell you how the coat thing consumes me.I like Luther (BBC One). It allows the mind to roam across many questions while the story unspools efficiently before you, asking little in the way of mental or emotional investment and giving much in the way of solidly old-fashioned whodunnitry. Pairs well with apple crumble and custard or large slabs of Dairy Milk.Series five opens with the big yin catching a tiny reciist and dropping him – in memory, from forefinger and thumb like Gulliver with a Lilliputian who has been trying to put Lemuel’s eye out with a titchy bow and arrow – in the back of his car before Luther himself is captured (this takes an armed gang and a Taser to the neck) and taken to an abandoned dancehall for questioning.The questioner is organised crime boss George Cornelius from series four, but instead of taking what would seem a heaven-sent opportunity to ask about the coat, he and a minion with a baseball bat interrogate Luther about Cornelius’s missing son. Luther says he knows nothing about it. More baseball batting and Tasering, until Luther – seemingly through sheer force of will – causes the chair he is bound to to collapse and whacks Cornelius’s coterie with it. Cornelius says he was just making sure Luther wasn’t in on his son’s kidnapping Luther reckons he will ask around a bit for him. I am not sure why. I suspect it doesn’t matter.Meanwhile, two people are being murdered by someone in a clown mask festooned with LED lights – not, alas, as a cheery nod to the season, but to confuse any CCTV cameras that might be watching. One of them has his eyes and tongue removed, the other has nails hammered into him. The former, they deduce from various clues and a wearying knowledge of the heavy-handed nature of symbolic acts by potential serial killers, was probably murdered for witnessing the latter.“Is this normal?” asks new recruit DS Catherine Halliday. She is a graduate, not a maverick. Luther sighs and walks – he still hasn’t mastered it properly – away to find the killer. But first he has to rescue the gang member he forced to spy on Cornelius who got caught and is now shackled to a car park pillar with a bomb collar around his neck. Luther does this. We are all relieved. It’s all fun and games being a maverick until someone loses a head.Then we come to my favourite portion of any crime procedural: the part when they play FortunatelyUnfortunately.Fortunately, a member of the public comes in to tell the police who dun the murders. She is Hermione “Cold Feet” Norris, putting her talent for icy-stillness-inducing-foreboding to good use as affectless psychiatrist Dr Lake, who reckons her client with a penchant for hammering nails into people and who turned up at her house last night covered in blood is their man. Unfortunately, he has since, she shrugs, disappeared. James Howser is his name turning people into pincushions is his game.Fortunately, Luther sees at once that doctor and patient are locked in some kind of psychosexual dynamic that he can exploit. Unfortunately, Halliday has ethical concerns about this. Fortunately, Luther ignores them – and his colleague’s advice to hide from Halliday the truth about his maverick policework because she will one day soon be their boss – and goes ahead.Unfortunately, Dr Icy Lake has seen what is expected of psychiatrists in police procedurals and remains unmoved. “This is a tawdry form of manipulation,” she says frostily. “I expected better.” Fortunately, it’s all a front and they are able to tap her phone as she arranges to meet James in the woods and usher him to safety and follow her there. Unfortunately, It all goes wrong and they lose their man.Fortunately for the viewer, there are two tremendous twists thereafter that promise to power us comfortably through the next three episodes and into the new year. Luther too, maybe, if he buys a bigger coat in the sales."},{"url":null,"title":"must see tv shows 2019","story":"Drama catches on to Brexit, Shane Meadows goes to Ireland, Helen Mirren plays Catherine the Great, and winter comes to Westeros by  Lanre Bakare,  Gwilym Mumford and  Stuart Heritage(Channel 4) For the last few years, Catastrophe has been one of the very finest comedies on television. However, 2019 is the year it all comes to an end. And, from what little information exists, it may be a bumpy ride. “We got to the last scene of the sixth episode and really, really embarrassingly, I kind of lost my shit a little bit,” Sharon Horgan revealed back in September. Start date: 7 January(Channel 4) AKA Benedict Cumberbatch’s Brexit film. Playwright James Graham has written this two-hour drama based on firsthand accounts of both the Remain and Leave movements. Cumberbatch plays the latter’s campaign director, Dominic Cummings. Co-starring Rory Kinnear, Richard Goulding and Oliver Maltman, Brexit: The Uncivil War promises to tell the tale of an epic game of cat and mouse – albeit a game where the cat eats the mouse and then poops all over your living room carpet. See Mark Lawson’s feature on Brexit TV.9 January(Sky AtlanticNow TV) True Detective season 1 was a game-changing piece of drama that existed at the meeting point between incredible writing, beautiful acting and sublime direction. True Detective 2 also existed. Hopefully, next year’s third series will be a return to form. The trailers – featuring Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali hopping backwards and forwards in time – look like vintage True Detective. Even more excitingly, one episode counts Deadwood creator David Milch as a co-writer. January(BBC Three) At this point, Phoebe Waller-Bridge can basically write her own cheques. For any other writer, Killing Eve would have been an all-time career highlight, but Fleabag remains her masterpiece. The first series was so perfectly self-contained, hinging on a flawlessly executed final-episode revelation, that it’s hard to know where a second series could go. But doubt Waller-Bridge at your peril. The woman can even fart on command. This will be unmissable. February(BBC One) Incredibly, Alan Partridge has been away from the BBC for 15 years. He’s been no slouch in the meantime, making films, writing books and starring in several perplexingly underwatched Sky specials, but this still feels like a homecoming. Not a vast amount is known about This Time … with Alan Partridge, except that it seems to be an extended One Show riff that will at least momentarily see Partridge standing inside a giant petri dish. This cannot come soon enough. February(Sky AtlanticNow TV) Finally, winter is here. After years of interpersonal squabbling, the rulers of Westeros must finally face the full force of the Night King and his White Walkers, and by all accounts it will be spectacular. Playing out across six ludicrously expensive feature-length episodes that utilise more SFX than ever, this looks set to become the high watermark of everything that television as spectacle can accomplish. April(Channel 4) After last year’s well-received Comedy Blap (Channel 4’s fancy name for a short, if you were wondering), Rufus Jones’s sitcom about a family who unknowingly return from a holiday in France with a Syrian refugee (Youssef Kerkour) in their boot receives a full series. Its tone is gentle rather than stridently satirical – understandable given the subject matter – but the gags are strong, the performances are likeable and the issues depicted could not be more timely. April(Channel 4) Shane Meadows projects are usually funny until they’re not. Punks and skinheads are all having a laugh, until they’re infiltrated by fascists. That creepy guy who is trying to woo your sister is harmless, until he turns out to be unhinged. But with The Virtues, Meadows seems to have reversed the formula. It tells the story of a labourer (played by Stephen Graham) – born in Ireland, put into care and then escaped to England – who goes back to deal with his demons. It’s bracing stuff, but in true Meadows fashion there’s humour interspersed with the grit. Told partly in flashback scenes filmed on handheld VCR cameras, it is visually ambitious – and Graham is magnetic as a man trying to overcome a painful history. April(SkyNow TV) HBO and Sky have teamed up for three big productions in 2019. This retelling of the biggest manmade disaster ever will focus on the people who tried to deal with immediate aftermath: in some cases to cover it up, and in others to ensure it could never happen again. Stellan Skarsgård plays Boris Shcherbina, the Soviet official charged with handling the fallout, Emily Watson is a nuclear scientist who wants to find out why the disaster happened and Jared Harris plays Valery Legasov, the Soviets’ man on the ground after the crisis. May(Channel 4) The first series of Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls was a monster of a show – Channel 4’s biggest new comedy in five years. A classic sitcom premise married to some timely 1990s nostalgia, where all the teens-go-mad action was flanked by the constant shadow of the Troubles. It’s such a perfect formula that a second series cannot feasibly disappoint. Spring(BBC One) Sally Wainwright stays in West Yorkshire, but swaps Hebden Bridge for Halifax as she tells the story of Anne Lister, the 19th-century figure often referred to as the “first modern lesbian”. Suranne Jones plays Lister, who became the head of a powerful family after the death of her four brothers in 1826. The eight-part series tells the story of her rise and eventual marriage to Ann Walker, an heiress of a neighbouring estate. It looks set to be one of the highlights of 2019. Spring(BBC One) The headline of MotherFatherSon is that it stars Richard Gere in the first major television role of his career, playing a Rupert Murdoch figure in a series that sounds thematically similar to last year’s Succession. But the real draw is its writer: Tom Rob Smith wrote the breathtaking American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and if he can bring even a fraction of that show’s claustrophobic tension to MotherFatherSon, it’ll be incredible. Spring(Channel 4) Long regarded as unfilmable – despite Mike Nichols’ perfectly serviceable 1970 adaptation – Joseph Heller’s black comedy is now coming to TV. Starring Christopher Abbott as Yossarian and co-starring Hugh Laurie and George Clooney (who also directs some episodes), Catch-22 has the potential to finally nail what was so special about Heller’s novel. Alternatively, it may mark the point where prestige TV finally overreaches itself. We’ll find out this year. Summer(ITV) ITV has so far struggled to find a ratings-winning replacement for Downton Abbey, but might this new period drama fit the bill? Created by Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) it follows residents of a 19th-century Delhi mansion owned by John Beecham, a former soldier haunted by the misdeeds he witnessed working for the East India Company. Set during the era when the British were battling for dominance over India, it should provide a pointed corrective to the dewy-eyed empire reminiscence being peddled as Brexit looms. Date tbc(Sky AtlanticNow TV) HBO’s whodunnit was one of 2017’s standouts with its tense thriller aspect butting up against a tale of small-town myopia and rivalry. The second season sees Jean-Marc Vallée try to repeat the feat while upping the stakes, as Meryl Streep joins Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon as Perry’s mother. She’s in town to find out what happened to her departed son, and she’ll need all her sleuthing to get past southern California’s scheming elementary-school parents.(Netflix) After a mixed fourth series full of more needless baby murders than anyone could ever really want, Charlie Brooker’s tech-horror anthology is back for another run. Everyone is keeping tight-lipped about what this new series has in store, but it’s been rumoured that one episode will be a Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive drama where you presumably pick the fate of the protagonist from 10 different but equally harrowing options. Date tbc(SkyNow TV) Following in the regal wake of The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots comes the story of the Russian monarch who reigned in the 18th century. Helen Mirren stars as the titular ruler in a show which looks as if it has all the hallmarks of a prestige drama (big-name star, large budget, co-production with HBO). The four-parter will focus on the end of Catherine’s reign and her affair with Grigory Potemkin, which promises to be salacious and shocking. Date tbc(Netflix) The second regal performance of the year from Olivia Colman, though one that’s a world away from her gout-ridden, lobster-racing Queen Anne of The Favourite. She takes over from Claire Foy as Elizabeth II, as Peter Morgan’s monarchical saga moves into the mid-60s – a turbulent time for the house of Windsor, with Princess Margaret (now played, in a note-perfect piece of casting, by Helena Bonham Carter) attracting column inches for her affair with baronet Roddy Llewellyn. Also joining the cast this time around are Tobias Menzies as a now middle-aged Prince Philip, and Jason Watkins, playing Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Date tbc(AmazonBBC2) Fantasy credentials don’t come much better than those of this Amazon series, which has been adapted by Neil Gaiman from the novel he co-wrote with the late Terry Pratchett. It stars David Tennant as a raffish demon who has formed an unlikely 6,000-year friendship with Michael Sheen’s buttoned-down angel. When a looming apocalypse threatens their bromance, the pair team up to save the world. Psychedelic visuals, epic set-pieces and some wild hairpieces sported by Tennant suggest this could be a blast. If that doesn’t sate your appetite, there’s season two of Gaiman’s other epic fantasy, American Gods, which comes back in March. Date tbc(BBC One) Stephen Graham has been lined up as the latest villain in Jed Mercurio’s police corruption saga, Line of Duty. All we know at the moment is that Graham will be a balaclava man, part of the murky group of criminals whose MO is killing someone you have been intimate with, smearing your DNA on the body, putting the cadaver in a freezer and threatening to ruin your life by framing you unless you obey their instructions. The last season dangled the prospect that the corruption that AC-12 has been sniffing out could be very close to home. In true Mercurio fashion, Graham’s suspect may be a classic bit of misdirection. Date tbc(BBC One) Series four of everyone’s favourite chest-baring period drama ended with a jolting death that suggested the cosy Sunday-night staple still has the capacity to shock. Might more surprises be in store for its fifth and final run? What we do know is that it will see Ross (Aidan Turner) ditch Westminster to return to Cornwall, though the arrival of a friend in need will force him to once again take on the forces of the establishment, not least – one suspects – the nefarious George Warleggan. A final reckoning between the two surely awaits.

Several new cities would be created by the project, adding hundreds of thousands of new residents and hundreds of miles of new roadways.But almost half of the proposed area of construction falls within what US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) scientists recognise as “primary zone” for dwindling numbers of the Florida panther, a subspecies of puma of which barely 200 adults are believed to survive.The FWS says preservation of the entirety of the big cats’ hunting and roaming zone, which incorporates about 20,000 acres of the Collier development, is “essential for the survival of the Florida panther in the wild”.“This area was never intended for this amount of development,” said Amber Crooks, environmental policy manager of the Conservancy of Southwest Florida.“These parts of Collier county contain a lot of important habitat for the Florida panther and also so many other rare species and has important public lands on each corner. The best available science tells us the panther needs all its available habitat to survive and ultimately recover,” she said.The FWS must approve or reject the “habitat conservation plan” (HCP) submitted by the landowners, known collectively as Eastern Collier Property Owners, by the end of April. Under the Endangered Species Act, government approval is required when an otherwise lawful development could result in an incidental “take” of any listed species.Crooks’ group, along with the Sierra Club and Center for Biological Diversity, submitted 20,000 signatures and a 100-page letter of objection to the FWS during a 45-day public comment period that ended last month. Crooks said the service rejected their request to extend the comment period or hold a public meeting, in a letter citing shorter Trump-era deadlines for the process.“It was a quick 45 days,” she said. “Certainly we would have liked more time.”Other environmental groups, meanwhile, have worked with the landowners on a mitigation plan that promises $150m for panther conservation and 107,000 acres of non-primary zone land for preservation in exchange for development approval.Elizabeth Fleming, the Florida representative of Defenders of Wildlife, said previous developments had won approval despite the outright opposition of environmentalists, and collaboration could provide a better outcome for wildlife.“We’re not evil people who are being conscripted by the landowners to do thus and such,” she said. “When landowners can better trust in government policies and work together with conservation groups, we can come up with a successful paradigm that can be replicated elsewhere.“And with sea level rise predictions, some of the habitat available to the panthers now will no longer be. They’re going to need to move north through private lands because there just isn’t enough public conservation land, so the willingness of private landowners to accept sharing their land with these predators is so important.”Fleming said the landowners have been mostly receptive and made changes to the plan, including widening of corridors through which panthers would travel. “We have identified areas that shouldn’t be developed that they have avoided, and helped them make some of the travel linkages wider,” she said.“At the beginning they only wanted to work with panthers and we persuaded them to incorporate other species. That’s not to say we are completely satisfied with what they have turned in to FWS. We continued to submit comments as part of the public process and hope they will take into account some of our suggestions and make this plan better.”Crooks, however, is sceptical the approach has been successful. “Even after a decade of trying both from the inside with those groups sitting at the table with the landowners, and pushing from the outside, this plan still has so many fatal flaws that we hope the service will see, and deny it,” she said.Christian Spilker, vice-president of land management for Collier Enterprises and spokesperson for Eastern Collier Property Owners, did not return several messages for comment, but in a December opinion piece in the Naples News claimed the landowners were “good stewards of the land and treasured native wildlife”.“The HCP preserves 156 sq miles of high-quality habitat forever available to the Florida panther and a vast number of other protected and native species,” he wrote.The latest proposed encroachment on shrinking panther territory is far from an isolated example. Rising waters both in the ocean and the Everglades also threaten the rare animal. Its cousin, the eastern cougar, was declared extinct in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19af921e0d1f352446a25f1bbd5f9fecd50c2e69/0_0_4075_2445/master/4075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df406b5b504cde7c157786d6bbb27cf","title":"us satellite imagery 2018 kilauea hurricane florence paradise","story":"From lava flows on Hawaii to raging fires in California, images gathered from high above Earth by satellites in 2018 show how humanity, geopolitics and the force of nature upended lives and landscape"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa0bcdf28e1b4b2320897ab8580f8857296563b/0_28_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a46cbda12fa664221bd21a0818481fd","title":"all necessary means xi jinping reserves right to use force against taiwan","story":"Chinese leader calls for reunification and says independence would be a ‘disaster’Taiwan independence would lead to “disaster”, Chinese president Xi Jinping has said, pledging efforts for peaceful “reunification” with the self-ruled island but warning China would not renounce the use of force.Speaking at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on the 40th anniversary of a key Taiwan policy statement, Xi said reunification must come under a one-China principle that accepts Taiwan as part of China, anathema to supporters of Taiwan independence.All people in Taiwan must “clearly recognise that Taiwan independence would only bring profound disaster to Taiwan”, Xi said.“We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,” he said.“We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,” he said, adding that the issue is China’s internal affair and that it would permit “no external interference”.Taiwan is China’s most sensitive issue and is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory. Xi has stepped up pressure on the democratically governed island since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party became president in 2016. There was no immediate reaction from Taiwan’s government. Xi reiterated that China was willing to talk with any party in Taiwan to push the political process – stalled by China since Tsai took office – as long as they accepted the “one China” principle.He sought to reassure people in Taiwan that there was nothing to fear from Chinese rule, even though most people there had shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing. “After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives. With the great motherland’s support, Taiwan compatriots’ welfare will be even better, their development space will be even greater,” Xi said. Tsai, who says she wants to maintain the status quo with China, said on Tuesday China must use peaceful means to resolve its differences with Taiwan and respect its democratic values. Beijing has regularly sent military aircraft and ships to circle the island on drills in the past few years and has heaped pressure on the island internationally, including whittling down its few remaining diplomatic allies. Taiwan, where Chinese Nationalist forces fled in December of 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists, is gearing up for presidential elections in a year. Tsai’s party suffered stinging losses to the China-friendly Kuomintang in mayoral and local elections in November.

We had given a standing order to the police to provide all possible protection to any woman who wants to enter the temple.”Media reports said the two women started the long uphill trek through forests to the temple at about midnight and reached it at about 4am. They were accompanied by a group of policemen. They left after offering prayers to the deity, Lord Ayyappa who is celibate. It is this celibacy that is the reason Hindu traditionalists believe women under 50 should not enter the temple. The fear is that the women could “tempt” the deity.M T Ramesh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) in Kerala denounced the visit as “a conspiracy”. “Why this midnight visit? The Kerala government has connived in this crime. It is a conspiracy between the women and the government.”For three months, Kerala has been the venue of an angry showdown between Hindu traditionalists and the supporters of a September ruling by the supreme court saying that women of all ages must be allowed to enter the temple.After the ruling, several women tried to reach the shrine but were forced to retreat by activists comprising both ordinary women and political groups, including the ruling BJP which opposes the court ruling on the grounds that the tradition of this temple must be upheld.Prime minister Narendra Modi said in an interview on Tuesday the ban was a matter of religious belief, not gender equality.Amit Malviya, the national head of the BJP’s information and technology wing, tweeted: “Have the Communists (the communist party rules Kerala) desecrated Sabarimala shrine by facilitating entry of women of restricted age group into the temple? Devastating, if true.”Local activist Rahul Easwar, who spearheaded the protests against the ruling, told a TV channel that he would verify the footage and take “appropriate action”.The Kerala government supports the court ruling but has been unable to implement it owing to the protestors camped at the place where the path up to the shrine starts. On 22 January, the supreme court will hear a petition challenging the ruling.On Tuesday, hundreds and thousands of women in Kerala formed a human chain 380 miles (620km) long across the length of the state to demonstrate their support for gender equality. The “Women’s Wall” rally was backed by the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ddb7411077230c46b6150bbfa7b75019e2858f6/0_166_4229_2538/master/4229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461c7998d2202030db977acdf9934987","title":"vietnam criticised for totalitarian law banning online criticism of government","story":"Law forces internet providers to censor content deemed ‘toxic’ by the ruling communist government and hand over user dataVietnam has introduced a new cybersecurity law, which criminalises criticising the government online and forces internet providers to give authorities’ user data when requested, sparking claims of a “totalitarian” crackdown on dissent.The law, which mirrors China’s draconian internet rules, came into effect on 1 January and forces internet providers to censor content deemed “toxic” by the ruling communist government. Vietnam’s ministry of public security said it will tackle “hostile and reactionary forces”, but human rights groups said it was authorities’ latest method of silencing free speech.The Vietnam government has intensified a crackdown on criticism since 2016, jailing dozens of dissidents. Spreading information deemed to be anti-government or anti-state online is now illegal in the country, as is using the internet to “post false information that could cause confusion and damage to socio-economic activities”.Last week, the country’s Association of Journalists published a code of conduct banning reporters from posting information that could “run counter” to the state on social media. Daniel Bastard of Reporters Without Borders called the measures “a totalitarian model of information control”.The government has asked Facebook and Google to open offices in Vietnam, and to agree to comply with the new censorship and user data rules. Hanoi claimed that Google has put steps in place to open a base in the country, although the search engine has not confirmed this. In response to the new law, Facebook said it would protect users’ rights and safety.Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director, said the legislation was “the legal equivalent of a hammer to bash online critics, with overly broad provisions that can be easily used to classify almost any critical comment as criminal.”He told the : “While it’s likely that activists who have previously spoken up against government abuses will be targeted first, the government’s longer-term plan is to bring the internet under the same draconian controls that affect print media, TV and radio. The government’s new year gift to its citizens is intensified fear about what they can say online, and uncertainty about what issues and statements will trigger arrests and prosecution.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute are continuing to appeal for witnesses after death of pedestrianProf Shane Higgins takes over from Dr Rhona Mahony for seven-year termMen arrested over Raheny shootings suspected in string of similar robberiesSyria tops list of countries from where most new asylum seekers came in 2017Most of 3,500 asylum seekers in 2018 were from Georgia, then Albania and SyriaDepartment of Health and HSE websites updated to carry details on available servicesThird of families presenting as homeless are foreign nationals whose rights are \u0026lsquounclear\u0026rsquoEoghan Murphy and Simon Harris may be among Ministers to be reassigned portfoliosDomestic Violence Act 2018 to include new crime of coercive controlAttorney General concerns centred on how distance could be enforcedTaoiseach concedes big challenges remain but argues real progress has been madeOver 108,200 patients in need of a hospital bed were forced to wait on trolleysTechnological University Dublin has 28,000 students with Grangegorman main campusAdrienne Cullen campaigned for a no gagging clause policy in hospitals across EuropeOngoing uncertainty of Brexit \u0026lsquodrains hope\u0026rsquo from society, says joint new year\u0026rsquos message\u0026lsquoSerious concern\u0026rsquo at sharp increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on roadsUnionist leaders remain united in their opposition to proposed Irish backstopJust one second separates babies born at Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, and the Coombe"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745450.1546367355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new law on drivers overtaking cyclists abandoned","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Transport Shane Ross said it had proved exceptionally difficult to draft legislation on a minimum passing distance that was constitutional and that could be enforcedA proposed new law that would have set a minimum passing distance for drivers overtaking cyclists has been abandoned after the Attorney General raised concerns, Minister for Transport Shane Ross has confirmed.The proposal, contained within the Road Traffic (Minimum Passing Distance of Cyclists) Bill 2017, would have made it an offence to pass a cyclist closer than 1m on roads with a speed limit under 50kmh and within 1.5m on roads with a limit of 50kmh or higher.Mr Ross said it had proved exceptionally difficult to draft legislation on a minimum passing distance that was constitutional and that could be enforced, and as a result the Bill would not proceed.It is understood the Attorney General’s concerns centred on how the 1m and 1.5m distance could be measured for enforcement purposes.“So what we are doing now is drafting a statutory instrument which will make dangerous overtaking, specifically of a cyclist, an offence.”This new law will not specify a minimum passing distance.Mr Ross said he believed this alternative would have largely the same effect and hoped this law would be in place by April this year.Mr Ross told The  he had not decided whether the penalties for dangerous overtaking of a cyclist would be the same as those proposed for the minimum passing distance Bill, which were three penalty points and an €80 fine.Mr Ross also said he hoped the roll-out of more cycle lanes would give cyclists more protection and help reduce the “hostility” between cyclists and drivers.He said both cyclists and drivers should obey the law, particularly at junctions.The new law is a response to the number of collisions involving cyclists and motor vehicles that result in serious injuries or death. Last year, nine cyclists were killed on Irish roads, down from 14 in 2017.However, Dr Mike McKillen of the advocacy group cyclist.ie questioned the merit of any new law that did not contain a specified passing distance.He pointed out that there was already a law against dangerous overtaking in Ireland but that, despite repeated parliamentary questions submitted on behalf of cyclists, no evidence could be found of it being enforced when it came to dangerous overtaking of a cyclist.“I fail to see how specifically creating this new offence of ‘dangerous overtaking of a cyclist’ is going to improve on that.”Dr McKillen said Irish drivers were so litigious it was almost impossible to introduce any road safety measure. “They resent change, whether in terms of speeding or drink-driving penalties or anything else. Our drivers will challenge anything to prevent change.”In a research paper on the merits of a minimum passing distance law and improvements in cyclist safety published in February 2018, the Road Safety Authority said it had found limited evidence to support the implementation of minimum passing distance legislation.Recommending against the law, it suggested instead creating an education and awareness campaign based around an advisory minimum passing distance of 1m on roads with a speed limit under 50kmh and within 1.5m on roads with a limit of 50kmh or higher.The RSA said these guidelines should also be included in the Driver Theory Test and the Rules of the Road to inform drivers of the necessity for safe passing distances for cyclists."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Belfast 1994 archives: American embassy official described meetings with NI politiciansBelfast 1994 archives: Cahal Daly told NI minister an internal

Photograph: Alan BetsonUS-Ireland Alliance president Trina Vargo urged Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to stop sending diplomats to events organised by men-only Irish-American societies as they were not representative of Irish America.In an email to Mr Varadkar, Ms Vargo shared a statement issued by the male-only Society of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick in New York notifying members that they were encouraged to invite female guests to its 235th anniversary dinner in March.“I am writing to strongly encourage the Irish Government to stop sending diplomatic representatives to these men-only membership organisation events. It’s time to drag Irish America into the 21st century,” Ms Vargo, a former US congressional aide, wrote in her November 10th email.She said the male-only Irish-American societies were “not representative of the 36 million Irish Americans” . The image risked the future of relations between the two countries, she said.“This is but one example why the very future of this relationship is in doubt. I can’t tell you how difficult it is to interest people in becoming involved in a contemporary US-Ireland relationship when this is their image of Irish America,” she wrote in the email released under the Freedom of Information Act.“The Irish Government is seen to endorse such organisations when it sends representatives to these dinners. Are women supposed to be impressed by this? I hope the Government will do the right thing here.”The Society of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick encouraged it members “to invite their wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, nieces and female cousins, friends and colleagues” to the dinner on March 15th.“We are confident that the inclusion of women at the society’s annual dinner will serve as a peaceful example of inclusion, compassion and respect for all people,” said its president Kevin Rooney. The US-Ireland Alliance is behind the George J Mitchell scholarship programme that brings 12 US graduates to study in Ireland every year. Ms Vargo also hosts the annual Oscar Wilde Awards to honour the Irish working in Hollywood and is a commentator on Irish and US politics.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

Harry\u0026#39s birth name Henry hits top spot but Meghan is nowhere to be seenPerhaps  readers have been inspired by the Royal wedding. Henry - Prince Harry’s birth name - has risen to the top of the charts for baby boys, according to  birth announcements.The name Henry shares top place with Arthur among  readers. Margot, a lowly 12th in 2017, and Matilda are joint top of the girls’ list.Henry rose to top from third last year, possibly on the strength of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle in May. The order of service, made public on the eve of the wedding, listed the groom under his official title His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.Matilda The Musical, based on Roald Dahl\u0026#39s bookRoyal names dominate the boys’ list. After Henry and Arthur in the  readers’ popularity stakes comes Edward, William and George.Girls’ names are not seemingly on Royal message. There are no Meghans - in fact there hasn’t been a Meghan with that spelling since 2001 - and no Kates or Catherines in the top 30. There was a Queen Matilda on the English throne - she was married to King Stephen - but you have to go back almost 900 years.Margot Robbie on the red carpetMore likely Matildas are being named after Roald Dahl’s heroine, now hugely popular in an award-winning musical, while the incidences of Margot is trickier to explain. The Australian actress Margot Robbie, one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, is one possible explanation.Susan Cole, a retired librarian, from Sutton, Surrey, who has been compiling the list for almost 50 years since 1969, said: “Henry now tops the list but Harry doesn’t even make the top ten. Surprisingly Harry comes in at only 21st, well below Henry.”Ms Cole suggested that the Royal wedding - and the prominent use of the name Henry on the order of service - could have swung it among more traditional  readers. The shortened Harry, by contrast, appears passe.The girls’ list contains some unusual names high up including Ottilie at joint third and Cosima just outside the top ten.Top 10 Boys’ names announced in the Please review our commenting policySix killed as passenger train \u0026#39hit by objects\u0026#39 from beer freight trainFemale worshipers break blockade to secretly enter one of India\u0026#39s holiest templesYoung women sent abroad for forced marriages having to pay Foreign Office for their rescue as critics label practice \u0026#39immoral\u0026#39UK ticket-holder scoops £115m EuroMillions jackpot on New Year\u0026#39s Day drawComment: Revamped rail service will put last year\u0026#39s unacceptable disruption behind usComment: What a delight to see strong women back on the silver screenComment: Forty years ago, Britain faced a far worse situation.

FTSE 100 CEOs are falling like skittles FTSE 100 reaches record high as pound sterling drops to 2018 low Nonetheless, The Independent’s fortune tellers are bravely stepping into the breach again having taken a refresher course under Professor Trelawney (Harry Potter fans will know what I mean). We’ve also lined up a panel of worthies from the City. Our sincere thanks to all of them for being such good sports and putting their heads above the parapet.\u0026nbspI’ve changed the rules a bit this year: our panel was told they could vary their predictions based on possible Brexit outcomes, because, well, who could possibly make an accurate prediction for where that will end up?\u0026nbspBut before we get down to business, the usual warning. This feature is designed to be fun. If you’re going to put actual money down, do your own research into stocks and the markets and consider taking professional advice too.As the editor of this feature, I get to go first. That’s not something I relish looking into the fog that surrounds 2019. But here goes.\u0026nbspMarkets are due a rally after this year’s sell off, the FTSE 100 in particular. It’s suffered from the complete lack of appetite for UK assets, something else to thank Brexit for. But it is also worth remembering that it’s dominated by international companies that make most of their money overseas. It means there is real\u0026nbspvalue to be had for the savvy investor, and perhaps a lot. If some kind of Brexit deal is reached, or better still we have a referendum and stay, I’m going for a relief rally (at some point) and an end of year close of 7,200, which I admit might look optimistic. If it’s no deal, then we’re in real trouble. The markets will hate it, so maybe 6,800. Why not worse? If\u0026nbspthe pound really collapses, the UK’s foreign currency earning stocks could start to look absurdly cheap. But I’d advise heading out of the country if you have the option.Stock pick: HSBC (646.9p). CYBG (181.2p) if Brexit is resolvedI’ve no great love for HSBC, which has had a chequered regulatory history in recent years. That said, while it has a big UK business, its most important markets are\u0026nbspin the far east and it reports earnings in US dollars. The third quarter results were unexpectedly good and the shares have climbed since then. But it’s still offering a prospective idend yield of 6 per cent, with no signs that the payout is under any threat. That’s right, 6 per cent. Eventually people will wake up to a number like that. With the UK in turmoil, there are good reasons for investors to look to this most international of banks. If you think Brexit will end well, and the sugar plum fairy actually exists, however, take a look at challenger bank CYBG following its acquisition of Virgin Money. That was a sweet deal and yet the business trades on just six times earnings.\u0026nbspIf this ends better than I expect, its current price\u0026nbspcould look ridiculously cheap this time next year.While global stock markets looked like they were heading in the right direction earlier this year, they’re moving\u0026nbspinto 2019 on a markedly different path. The FTSE 100 hit record highs in May off the back of the weakened pound. However, while sterling continued its decline throughout the rest of the year, it was not enough to sustain the stock market’s strength. The root of all this volatility was, of course, Brexit, and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to be cleared up any time soon.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the pound is likely to see a crash of its own – but as we now know, that doesn’t necessarily mean a rally for the FTSE anymore. It could head back towards multi-year lows as investors scramble to distance themselves from the UK. Even if Theresa May manages to get some sort of deal through parliament, it will be some time before we know what sort of impact the new arrangement is having.It seems foolish to make any predictions but I’m going to target a FTSE 100 close of 7,000 – which seems wildly optimistic at this point in time.IAG is the owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, among others. The FTSE 100 company has paid out pretty hefty idends in recent years, and it’s relatively cheap at the moment – the share price was knocked severely by a cyber attack over the summer. Despite concerns that a potential no-deal Brexit could wreak havoc on air travel in the UK, chief executive Willie Walsh has not wavered from his positive outlook and says the company is confident that it will not be harmed by disruption to flying rights – so confident that the group announced a €2.6bn investment plan in November. With oil prices forecast to drop over the next year, fuel costs should be more manageable too.It’s not been a vintage year for global stock markets. Most are lower than where they started. However, that’s the nature of the beast: stock market returns are lumpy. The UK economy continues to limp along, though a pick up in wage growth has been encouraging. Clearly Brexit is the big swing factor when it comes to the year ahead, and until there is some resolution on that front we can expect sentiment to remain febrile.With the FTSE 100, I’m once again going to play the averages (it only works as a strategy if you do it year in year out!) The FTSE adds about 5 per cent a year on average, excluding idends, so from current levels that puts us somewhere near 7,050.Stock pick: Lloyd’s Banking Group (51.85p) assuming\u0026nbspan orderly Brexit.\u0026nbspDiageo\u0026nbsp(2,795p)\u0026nbsp in the event of a disorderly BrexitIn an orderly Brexit outcome my stock pick would be Lloyds Banking Group.\u0026nbsp It currently has a prospective idend yield of around 5.5 per cent. When CEO Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011, the bank was making a loss of £260m. Last year it made a £3.5bn profit, yet the share price is lower than when he started. The market is selling down Lloyds because, at best, it doesn’t know what the next year holds for the bank’s profitability while Brexit hangs in the balance. If the UK economy is unscathed we can expect the share price to pick up. In bad outcome, all stocks are likely to come under pressure in the short term. So is the pound. Bets can be hedged a bit by holding an internationally ersified defensive stock like Diageo. The manufacturer of Guinness and Johnny Walker gets most of its revenues from overseas. And let’s face we’ll probably all need a drink in this scenario.Political shenanigans in Westminster and the ongoing negotiations with Brussels mean that offering any sort of forecast for the UK economy in 2019 is a pretty thankless task. You can see the pound going to $1 in the event of a Brexit outcome that markets don’t like and it going back to $1.50 if the negotiations are seen as finally yielding a positive result, so at $1.25 sterling is probably appropriately priced right nowWhen it comes to the FTSE 100 the darkest hour comes before the dawn and with pessimism so pervasive the market may have a better chance of making it to 8,000 by the end of 2019 than many suspect. It is trading at levels last seen in December 2016 and even languishes below the high reached at the climax of the technology bubble in December 1999. As such, a good degree of bad news may already be factored into the valuation of UK assets, especially as the pound is still trading some 13 per cent below where it stood on the day of the EU referendum in June 2016. Unloved often means undervalued and the UK is not expensive relative to its international peers or its own history on an earnings basis.\u0026nbspIt also offers a prospective yield of 4.9 per cent, which beats base rates pretty handily and also outstrips the 1.25 per cent yield of 10-year UK government bonds.I’m normally wary of banks but in the case of the FTSE 250 “challenger”\u0026nbspOneSavings Bank I am prepared to make an exception. The stock trades on barely 6.5 times earnings and 1.4 times book value while offering a idend yield of 4.1 per cent. If everything goes wrong from a political or macroeconomic perspective, the lowly valuation could provide some relative downside protection, while the yield may offer some compensation for the risks involved as investors tough it out. A Brexit deal triggering a rally in sterling, and a resurgence in interest in UK assets, will put stocks like OneSavings Bank in the vanguard of a recovery, especially as loan growth is robust. The firm’s return on equity of 26 per cent is outstanding relative to its peer group. Given the bank’s exposure to mortgages, smaller companies and its strong focus on buy-to-let there are clear risks. Any economic and house price downturn could test sentiment and profits. But the valuation is low.Brexit, Donald Trump’s trade war and budget tensions between Italy, France and eurozone authorities will be major drivers of markets as politics dominates the start of 2019. The future shape of the UK’s relationship with the European Union remains unclear. A chaotic Brexit is likely to result in a fall in the pound, which is positive for the FTSE 100 as the majority of its earnings are generated abroad. However, a sharp rally in sterling could be negative for the index and any gains will be capped. Hopefully Donald Trump will be pushed in the direction of getting some sort resolution with China over the trade dispute so he can declare a “win” sooner rather than later. This will be positive for markets worldwide. The biggest risk is that the US Federal Reserve oversteps the mark and slams the brakes on the US economy too hard. However, there are signs that the central bank may be more doveish than many expected My FTSE 100 prediction: 7,100Growth at this Middle Eastern private healthcare network operator is supported by a strong economy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the rollout of mandatory health insurance in the country. It also benefits from the UAE’s limited corporation tax regime and is expanding into Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Its new joint venture in Saudi Arabia, which will see it become one of the largest healthcare operators in the kingdom, is due to complete in the first quarter of 2019.Andy Brown, head of direct equities, Tilney Asset Management\u0026nbspLooking into next year, in the near term sentiment towards UK shares will depend in large part on what happens between now and the end of March when the UK is set to leave the EU. Many of the big UK political risks appear to be playing out now in the form of a potentially messy Brexit and with doubts about the sustainability of the current UK government. These anxieties are reflected in current UK equity valuations, which at 11 times earnings, are well below other developed markets and their longer-term trend.It’s important not to confuse UK equities and the domestic economy. In fact well over two-thirds of the earnings of FTSE 100 companies in aggregate are made outside of the UK. Currency volatility is likely to remain a feature which will have both an operational and financial impact of many UK companies. Not only are UK equities at discounted valuations, idends remain an attractive feature of the UK market both compared with\u0026nbspother regions and bond yields. We expect the FTSE 100 to eke out small gains by the end of 2019, perhaps finishing at around 7350, but with idends on top.DS Smith is a leading supplier of packaging products with a genuine global presence.

We are not short of key themes to ensure a bumpy ride across the year Trade wars, China slowdown, US Federal Reserve tightening (or not), Brexit and Italy all point to 2018’s volatility continuing if not rising in the year to come.The already challenging task of crystal-ball-gazing is almost impossible heading into 2019. With so much uncertainty surrounding Brexit and just three months to go to the break, perhaps the only certainty for the pound and the FTSE 100 is the continuation of this new uncertain phase.The year just gone has been a nightmare for the FTSE, which is down around 11 per cent this year, despite a 5 per cent drop in sterling. Weakness in the pound is good news for all the international stocks on the FTSE, around 70 per cent of the index itself. However, we expect broader fears of slowing global growth to ramp up across 2019, starting as soon as January with a softer US earnings season.Predictions for the FTSE would need to be split depending on the type of Brexit Theresa May secures. A disorderly, no-deal Brexit could see the pound plummet which would offer more support to the FTSE, as we saw post the Brexit referendum. However, a key difference is that the global economy was in better position in 2016. Under this scenario we envisage a very volatile year with the FTSE ending only marginally higher.A Brexit deal will see the pound recover some ground, adding pressure to the FTSE. A stronger pound, plus growing concerns over global growth would mean a difficult year for the FTSE which could close lower.Making money on stocks in 2019 amid such uncertainty will require careful choices. Gold has not lifted off this year, shedding 5 per cent of its value as a strong US economy and the\u0026nbspFederal Reserve\u0026nbsphiking rates have boosted faith in the dollar. However, with the Fed expected to slow its rate of interest rate rises this year the glitter could return to gold. With the precious metal expected to increase between 5 per cent and 15 per cent miner Randgold Resources will be a stock to watch.It has been a volatile year, although much of this comes off the back of 2017, one of quietest on record. The “synchronised global growth”\u0026nbspidea disappeared fairly early on, and trade wars have certainly not helped matters. The great post-2008 bull market has not come to an end, but it has taken quite a kicking. Things will remain volatile, but some of the bearishness and pessimism is perhaps overdone.If Brexit ends with a dealRemain, then the FTSE\u0026nbsp100\u0026nbspcould hit 7,500, but if no deal 6,000.\u0026nbspThe life insurer has good exposure to Asia, a strong idend, and is reasonably valued. I think this works in both situations.Stephen\u0026nbspAdams, head of equities, Kames CapitalDisorderly Brexit risk, Corbyn risk, earnings risk, monetary policy risk: it is little wonder then that the FTSE 100 is down. Nor is it clear that any of these pressures are abating as we head into the start of 2019. However, on a 12-month view it is possible to see the catalysts for a higher UK equity market.UK equities are the contrarian global asset class,\u0026nbspand any clarity on Brexit short of a no-deal cliff edge would likely be taken well. It is also possible that the economy would enjoy a relief bounce with the release of some pent up demand and a looser fiscal stance. In that scenario I would envisage the FTSE at 7,450 by year end 2019.By mid-year we may also witness a pause in US monetary tightening and a stabilisation in rebased earnings per share forecasts. Even with a no-deal Brexit I could see a FTSE little changed over the year as sterling takes the strain and the high percentage of overseas earnings in the blue chip index receive\u0026nbspa boost on any devaluation, so\u0026nbsp6,800.The deal with Schneider materially enhanced the sales opportunities for Aveva’s world class portfolio of design, engineering, construction and industrial software solutions. Recent updates have proved reassuring and with a significant proportion of the company’s earnings in foreign currency,\u0026nbspAveva would receive translational benefits on any sterling weakness.\u0026nbspBalfour Beatty, meanwhile,\u0026nbsphas undergone a painstaking and protracted period of dealing with underperforming contracts and has emerged with a strong balance sheet, rising margins and resilient cash flows unlike some competitors. As a contractor with a number of UK government contracts the stock should bounce on a Brexit deal and the valuation should see an upward re-rating.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Andy Martin reportsClick to followThe IndependentZia and his Velocity co-founder Alex MacdonaldI was wearing my Kenzo patchwork jacket, my Billabong denim shirt, and a sort of Gareth Southgate waistcoat. And I had slapped on David Beckham\u0026nbspHomme quite liberally. I was taking notes with my Montblanc pen, trying to blend in with supermodels, Premiership footballers\u0026nbspand hedge fund manager types\u0026nbspat a snazzy restaurant in the upmarket Tribeca neighbourhood of Manhattan. Because I was having a power breakfast with Zia Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of Velocity. And if you’re worrying about how much it costs to join, then it’s probably not for you. “And your membership name is?” said the exceptionally charming hostess at the door. For a brief while, I was living the dream. Even the smashed avocado on toast seemed like the best smashed avocado I’d ever tasted. Likewise the coffee. And the cutlery and the napkins were outstanding too. “My mum told me not to buy nice things,” Yusuf says, “because you always lose them.” Velocity doesn’t do things, it does experiences. In an exclusive way. For “premium consumers”. “We treat members as human beings,” said Yusuf, “not very rich people.”Yusuf’s key insight is that even if you’re as rich as Croesus, you still need a digital Jeeves – an all-purpose concierge service – to fix things for you, discreetly, effortlessly, infallibly. I didn’t even try to download the Velocity app. It can probably spot if you’re not a billionaire.A View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonA View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techZia Yusuf, 32, did not come from money. Born in a village outside Aberdeen, he is the son of Sri Lankan parents. His father is a paediatrician for the NHS and his mother is a nurse. At the age of 13 he had a moment that he still recalls fondly, when his father came into his room and said, “Do you want to go to Disney World?” He had always wanted to go to Disney in Paris, but his father said, “We’re not going there, we’re going to the original in Florida!” They had scrimped and saved and maxed out the credit card and it was still 10 months in the future – and the young Yusuf was so excited he could hardly sleep for the last month. “But it was something to look forward too. That’s what we try to provide at Velocity. It’s about making you feel like a kid again.”He went to Hampton School, then studied international relations at the LSE. In his final year he signed up for Merrill Lynch, for the sake of “peace of mind”. But this was in 2008. After Lehman Brothers went to the wall he got in touch with the guy who had given him the job, just to make sure everything was still in place. He got an automated message back: “This person is no longer with the company…” Nothing is plain sailing. Everything always goes wrong. Unless, that is, you’re a Velocity member. There’s a story by Kafka of a bloke who goes up to an open door but the doorman keeps him waiting outside for years until he is finally dying and then he slams it shut. Tough. Velocity is like that, but the exact opposite. There’s a guy holding the door open and ushering you through it very respectfully wherever you go. If you’re a member, you’re walking on a red carpet the whole world over. You get the top table at the Ivy or a seat at the Wimbledon final. If you want to go surfing, they’ll arrange the perfect wave, with palm trees and sultry breezes, just for you. If you’re looking for the Holy Grail, it’s here, somewhere on the app. You want the moon? Have it. Have two. You have a dream? Dream no longer. “We’re a tech company,” says Yusuf, pushing a perfect mini-croissant in my direction. “But tech is a means not an end in itself.” The average “basket size” is $2,500. The biggest is $500k – for a single transaction. Client data is sacrosanct. No harvesting or marketing. Trust is paramount. F Scott Fitzgerald reckoned that “the very rich are different from you and me”. Ernest Hemingway replied, “Yes, they have more money.” Yusuf is more of the Hemingway school of thought. It was while at Goldman Sachs that he realised two things. One is that the super-rich have exactly the same anxieties and desires as everyone else. And the other is that they are not “leading crazy lives of hedonistic pleasure”. “They’re obsessed with what they do. They have more capital, but they suffer from time poverty.” Velocity gives them time back again by doing everything for them at the click of a button. Check the app. You want to go and swim with blue whales? It’s done. You want to… and here, glancing through the app, I come across something so sublime that I am not even allowed to say what it is. “As easy as ordering an Uber.” There is no hassle. Hassle has been abolished in the great and glorious realm of Velocity. It is, I have to concede, a wonderful world. Velocity was born in 2014 and launched in public after two years of development. “We (Yusuf and co-founder Alex Macdonald) agreed with Elon Musk – it can’t be slightly better, it’s got to be amazing.” They can do something as simple and sentimental as picking up your grandma at the airport too. And there is a romantic side. They have now arranged 14 full marriage proposals, always in the perfect setting, with (so far) 100 per cent success rate. I imagine they can do orces too, in a beautiful way. Yusuf himself used his own app recently. He had almost forgotten his mother’s birthday. Velocity stepped in and saved the day: a Sri Lankan-style dinner at Hoppers in London. “My Mum is hard to please,” says Yusuf, but she was delighted. “It was a lot better than an e-card.” He’s going to take her on safari the next time.It’s hard not to agree with Yusuf that “the paradox is that we have the ability to go and do more than any generation in history. But our tendency is to order in a pizza and binge on Netflix.” He wants to get busy people out into the real world again – effortlessly. And he stresses a surprisingly ethical dimension to the whole business. It’s not just about arranging meaningful and magical moments, or even matrimony. These experiences can actually make a difference to the wider world because the people having them also have a lot of power. Yusuf cites the case of a CEO who went on a “giraffe collaring” adventure with a team of conservationists. “He came out of it a changed man. His company went green overnight and he killed all single-use plastic cups. And our platform made it happen. Nothing beats an experience for changing your view of the world.” Which is why the velocity.black website has a special section called “impact”. “It all sounds great,” said a hard-working single mother who was giving me a lift later in the day, as I was coming down from Cloud 9. There was just a hint of bitterness in her voice. “I would like to go swimming with whales and tagging giraffes. Can I join?” “Of course you can,” I replied, soothingly. “You just have to win the lottery first.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He would ring, to tell me what the weather was like over there, while I was suffering, in grey, wet, chilly London. Or how, he was enjoying some fine, French wine he’d taken specially while sitting with his feet dangling in the warm, balmy sea.Not any more. So far, the phone has lain silent. Although after reading this, he might ring again, as he did in the summer, because I wrote something he did not agree with. Once again, I was treated to a volley of abuse, much of it too crude to repeat here.It’s been a recurring theme of 2018, the PR demise of Sir Philip Green or “PG” as he is known throughout the sector and City. When the year began, he’d still not recovered from the fallout over the sale of BHS to someone who did not have the financial muscle to take on a business of that size, and Green’s subsequent refusal to plug the company’s pension deficit. He did cough up, eventually, and only after much protest.Then, came Oliver Shah’s excellent biography, Damaged Goods: the Inside Story of Sir Philip Green, the Collapse of BHS and the Death of the High Street. It painted a colourful picture of Green, and his swaggering, bruising manner.That was followed by the revelation that Green had gagged former employees from detailing his sexual and racial harassment – claims that he vehemently denies.Finally, Green’s Arcadia group was exposed to what was a horrid shopping season. It certainly was an annus horribilis for him, reputation-wise, not that he would ever reach for a polite Latin phrase as the Queen once famously did – Green would opt for a more Anglo-Saxon wording.Sir Philip Green’s and Simon Cowell business partnership Spare a thought for poor old billionaire Philip GreenSir Philip Green’s net worth and retail empireWhen he looks back on where it all went wrong – to apply some context he remains incredibly wealthy, is still a high street force, retains his knighthood, and became a grandfather, but there’s no doubt he’s suffered – he only has himself to blame.That sense of self, of believing entirely in his own gifts, has propelled him to great heights. He’s a natural, intuitive, aggressive deal-maker, blessed with an uncanny propensity for mental arithmetic. Whether he’s a genius at the longer game of retailing is a moot point. Certainly, he knew how to build an empire, and to keep it buoyant – for a while. But did he read the long-term runes, and foresee the advent of online shopping, and did he exhibit the same fleetness of foot as some of his competitors?Green is not someone who responds constructively to criticism. If the media and politicians attack his convoluted financial arrangements that see the business vested in the name of his wife who lives in Monaco as a way of avoiding tax, he will roar his defiance.A more publicly empathetic person, one who cares deeply about how they’re perceived, who can see that the tax line will dog him constantly and be wheeled out as a weapon to beat him with, might end the arrangement and swallow the resulting hefty bill. But they would regard it as a price worth paying, for better treatment by the press and parliament, for a favourable public standing.Not Green. Similarly, from the off, as soon as the BHS affair blew up, he could have made a payment to cover the pension gap into an escrow account, and leave the lawyers to sort out the fine detail. But he chose not to.He complained that his opponents liked to focus on his extravagant, bling lifestyle. Meanwhile, he would order another superyacht, so that he owned not one, but two. His reasoning was that his spending was none of their concern, that what he did with his money was up to him. He would describe his lavish parties as private, but then call journalists to invite them to listen, down the line, as George Michael did a sound-check.He’s never fully appreciated that he is also a public figure, a modern celebrity, who courted publicity for himself and for his fashion products, who liked to be photographed surrounded by supermodels. In many town centres, his outlets play a vital role, as anchor tenants, central to the wellbeing of the shopping districts and accompanying communities. Green is a major employer, responsible for several tens of thousands of jobs. He cannot have it both ways.As with many kings, his world is also that of a court. His advisers are courtiers, there, possibly, to please not help, to say “can” rather than “can’t”, and “yes” not “no”. It’s questionable, whether his actions and the blows to his image are the result of receiving bad advice, or disregarding good advice and preferring to do his own thing. Whatever the answer, he became badly unstuck in 2018. For that, he was my Man of the Year, but for all the wrong reasons.For anyone looking at how not to manage communications, how to make a bad public relations situation worse, Green’s last 12 months is a textbook tour de force.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Clunge. Muffwagon. Goodness, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard those creative expressions of male sexual frustration, and it\u0027s\u0026nbspnice to hear them again, like old friends, or “Fwends” in this case. The Inbetweeners are back. Sort of.Even by the usually self-congratulatory standards of tellyland, the total of four hours and 10 minutes of airtime devoted by Channel 4 to their 2008 hit The Inbetweeners\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa tad self-indulgent, though it is one of the channel’s recent glories.\u0026nbspHosted, inevitably, by the roughly contemporaneous Jimmy Carr, the first two hours of this teenage marathon, The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, is given over to a sort of mix of This is Your Life, An Audience With..., and Radio 4’s The Reunion. That is followed by four full episodes of the series, mostly for the devotees, I imagine, as well as any stray viewers unfamiliar with this comedic landmark to judge this odyssey of pubic discovery, adolescence and embarrassment at first hand.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn all, The Inbetweeners ran to three series and two films, predominantly onanistic in tone, and most of the cast and creators turn\u0026nbspup for this celebration of its 10th anniversary. The Fwends Reunited show is dominated, naturally, by the four sixth form virginal idiots a good shag would have probably sorted out, but who, fortunately for us, never got lucky. Simon Bird (as Will McKenzie), Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper), James Buckley (Jay Cartwright) and Blake Harrison (Neil Sutherland) confirm the impression that they were basically playing themselves in The Inbetweeners and haven’t changed much since the last piece was smut was propelled like a flying turd into the public’s consciousness in 2014. I just hope their real-time personas have managed to “plunge some clunge” as they approach early middle age. Not sure, though.Given the vast prairie of time to fill, the producers plunder every known format to maintain some kind of momentum, and mostly to good effect, \u0026nbspthanks to the timeless quality of the original gags. So there is a series of “Awards” for stuff like “best bodily malfunction”, and I for one will never tire of seeing Simon projectile vomiting semi-digested creme de menthe on his girlfriend’s six-year-old brother nor of Simon’s left testicle hanging forlornly from his posing pouch in the school fashion show nor of watching Will tearfully confessing to his teacher that “I thought it was a fart”, as he had to be escorted from the A level exam room. You can almost smell the, er, shame.\u0026nbspThe 10 best TV shows of 2018The Inbetweeners\u0027 James Buckley \u0027could have died\u0027 filming boat scene There is a mini-quiz segment too, featuring Inbetweeners “super fans” whose programme knowledge exceeded that of the cast themselves, with a scholarly textual grasp of lines such as: “What is Swansea. Is it an animal?” “What\u0027s this pesto stuff? Is it for humans?” and “Just cos you’ve had your first puff on your first joint it doesn’t make you Kurt Cobain.”One super fan even had a tattoo of a grinning Jay with the inscription “CLUNGE” garnishing her upper thigh – ironically about as close as Jay ever got to a lady’s bodily treasure.The quiz “prize”, won by a Will lookalike in specs and a blazer, is a bright yellow M-reg Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii Edition, complete with “tape deck” and red passenger door.This runabout is also the co-star of the Fwends show and features in the freshly filmed sequences, such as their nostalgic trip back to Rudge Park Comprehensive\u0026nbsp(, as Carr puts it “in a car none of them owned to a school none of them went to”. Will relives the moment when he shat himself, which is, well, moving.Created with Sketch.Best TV of 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short.

I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The talking (dick) heads are good too, especially when creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris explain the genesis of some of the set pieces, often based on their own life experiences. Beesley, for example, confesses how he had ranted some foul-mouthed sarcastic abuse at some hapless kids for pushing in at an amusement park before bullying his way onto the ride. Smug, he turned to them and only then discovered that the selfish bastards were at the front of the rollercoaster because they had Down syndrome.\u0026nbspGreg Davies’s presence as the bad-tempered teacher Mr Gilbert is also enjoyable. No wonder that Davies went into comedy having himself been a bad-tempered teacher (“a living hell” in his seemingly sincere description). Waen Shepherd (Mr “Paedo” Kennedy) is extremely game to join in the fun –\u0026nbspperhaps surprising given the times we live in. Indeed, I wonder, only a few years on, if phrases such as “spaz” and “rapey” could be scripted now.You could call it a retrospective then, if you were pretentious enough, or “going in balls deep” if you’re Jimmy Carr. Although it lacks a certain pointfulness - the cast are even more absurdly old to play adolescents again and there will \u0026nbspbe no more episodes or movies \u0026nbsp- and all concerned refuse to take itself too seriously, which is just as well. Like a more successful sort of school reunion.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing more tedious than people earnestly trying to deconstruct comedy: much better instead just to get on with the clips and the poo jokes. And so they do, and so does Will get a high speed turd in the face from a water chute, and suddenly we are all back in the sixth form disco again.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off.

Everything up until now – the endless disputes, crises and resignations, the huge cost, both in gold and other reforms forgone, are just a prelude for the tougher task ahead.If the UK leaves the EU this year, it will do so with no blueprint for its future trading terms, after Brussels comprehensively torched the Chequers plan in September.To give one example of the tortures ahead, the Commons would have to decide, in the summer of 2020, whether to implement the Irish border backstop the following January – the key controversy currently obsessing MPs.Created with Sketch.

It will take many more years than that.Even if the UK ever puts forward realistic proposals, trade talks will be held up by MEP elections and the appointment of new commissioners – creating a vacuum ripe for new more Tory Euro-wars.And the alternative to embracing the backstop – the UK staying under EU rules beyond 2020, while paying tens of billions of pounds more for the privilege – is scarcely more appealing.Turn a corner?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification.“After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”The former Luxembourg PM added: “I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Hitting back last night, a No source said: “What does he hope to achieve by saying this  I don’t know whose interests that serves”.Tory MP Nigel Huddleston dubbed it “not particularly useful or helpful language”, adding: “It is inappropriate but not surprising, as he is under pressure from European businesses to produce a deal as well”.Mrs May has been told by Tories and the DUP to seek legally binding assurances that the backstop that keeps Britain in the customs union will be time-limited.One senior aide to the PM last week dubbed Mr Juncker the UK’s “best hope” of finding a fix as he was “put on this earth to negotiate”.The new row came as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox yesterday warned that the chances of Britain leaving the EU would be down to  Mrs May’s deal is voted down in two weeks time.It also emerged that senior Tory and Labour MPs are planning to force the government to delay Brexit by three monthsthe Commons throws out the deal.It was claimed that cross-party talks have been underway for several weeks to ensure the March  date is put back until July in a bid to win the government more time.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today accuses Theresa May and her ministers of tipping Britain “into crisis” for leaving the country with no deal with the EU in place with just  days to go today until Brexit takes place.In his New Year message, the Opposition boss attacked the Tories for “the complete mess they’ve made of Brexit, trying to drive through a bad deal and letting people down all across the country whether they voted leave or remain.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would bring a bit of common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved,” she said.“The Government should put an end to phoney incentive schemes that reward executives above and beyond the actual results they get.”Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey MP said Labour would go further than “weak Tory fudge”.She said: “Executive pay is running out of control. While the Conservatives’ watered-down regulations will only require large companies to publish pay bands, Labour in government will take decisive action on excessive pay.“Labour is committed to rolling out maximum pay ratios of : in the public sector and in companies bidding for public contracts, because it cannot be right that wages at the top keep rising while everyone ’s stagnates.“Labour will also legislate to reduce pay inequality by introducing an Excessive Pay Levy on companies with staff on very high pay.

We’re working with regulators and industry to ensure that consumers are not unfairly overcharged in the future - whether on their phone bills or their insurance premiums.”The cap follows an announcement by the competition watchdog before Christmas that suggested radical reforms to the way the insurance, mortgage, mobile phone and broadband markets operate after finding that loyal customers are being ripped off to the tune of £ billion.Following a “super complaint” by Citizens Advice, the Competition and Markets Authority investigated concerns that companies penalise existing customers by charging them higher prices than new customers.It also found that vulnerable people, including the elderly and those on a low income, may be more at risk of paying the loyalty penalty.The energy price cap has been set at £, per year for a medium domestic dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit.It was brought into law in July in the Domestic Gas and Electricity Act.But the amount people pay will depend on how much they use, with the cap limiting charges per unit of gas and electricity rather than bills.Ofgem is to review the cap every six months, with the first review in February to come into force in April, with consumer groups already warning it could rise.Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said the cap would ensure consumers “pay a fair price to heat and light their homes”.He said: “Consumers can have confidence that any rise in prices in the future will only be down to genuine increases in energy costs rather than supplier profiteering, while falls in energy costs will always be passed on to them.“Households who are protected by the cap will be able to save even more money by shopping around for a better deal.“In the meantime, Ofgem will continue with reforms which aim to deliver a smarter, more competitive energy market which, combined with protection for those who need it, works for all consumers.”However, consumer group Which  warned before Christmas that cheaper energy deals were vanishing from the market ahead of the cap.Its analysis from December found just eight tarfs costing less than £, a year - compared with  dual-fuel tarfs to choose from across Britain in January.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “The introduction of this cap will put an end to suppliers exploiting loyal customers.“However, while people on default tarfs should now be paying a fairer price for their energy, they will still be better offthey shop around.“People can also make longer-term savings by improving the energy efficiency of their homes.“Simple steps, such as better insulation or heating controls, are a good place to start.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000459022098.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"2019 is full of hope","story":"We have much to look forward to in the months ahead.You would scarcely believe it when listening to the Remain doom-mongers but away from the Westminster bubble, Britain is thriving.Today, Brits have never had more cash in their pockets.

Sinking two would double that toll.“We’ll see how frightened America is,” he then said, reports news.He bragged China’s new anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles are more than capable of taking out US carriers, despite them being at the centre of a bubble of defensive escorts.His threats came just ten days after experts warned a war between US and Chinese forces in the South China Sea could break out in .Concerns are mounting the two superpowers could become embroiled in a terrying conflict in the directly contested region which could kill thousands of people.Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst in defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra, told Sun Online: Expect greater tension in the South China Sea. China won’t back down – nor will the US.The South China Sea will remain a key flashpoint between China and the US, who are now engaged in an extended period of strategic competition.In his speech, Admiral lou said there were ‘five cornerstones of the United States’ open to exploitation: their military, their money, their talent, their voting system - and their fear of adversaries.He said China should “use its strength to attack the enemy’s shortcomings. Attack wherever the enemy is afraid of being hit. Wherever the enemy is weak …”It’s not the controversial commentator’s first aggressive outburst.In December he said: “If the US naval fleet dares to stop in Taiwan, it is time for the People’s Liberation Army to deploy troops to promote national unity onthe island.“Achieving China’s complete unity is a necessary requirement. The achievement of the past  years of reform and opening-up has given us the capability and confidence to safeguard our sovereignty.Those who are trying to stir up trouble in the South China Sea and Taiwan should be careful about their future.”Observers at the Council on Foreign Relations’ Centre for Preventive Action have ranked the South China Sea as a hotspot as Beijing and Washington refuse to back down over who controls the oil and gas rich region.Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei argue they own parts of the sea — and the United States is prepared to back them with military force.It is feared a showdown is on the cards which could spiral out of control.Maochum Yu, a history professor at the US Naval Academy in Maryland, said confrontation in the region is all but inevitable.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He had disobeyed orders — it did not matter that his actions probably saved hundreds of lives.Historian Damien Lewis, whose new book tells the full story of Operation Tombola, is now demanding Lees be posthumously awarded a medal.He says: “I’ve written loads about World War Two but I’ve never started a petition before. This guy’s story ­outraged me. This man was a hero.“He was a maverick, he disobeyed orders — but we recruited mavericks and free thinkers to the SOE because we need them to do the unthinkable and break the rules of war.“Instead of getting the due reward, his reputation was trounced. It is unfair. It is a betrayal of a great British war hero.”Lees, who died in , galvanised a motley crew of  soldiers including  SAS commandos, Italian partisans and other fighters from around the world.Under his fearless leadership, they stormed a villa in Italy’s ­Apennine Mountains that was the HQ of Germany’s th Army.The villa was like a fortress, defended by more than  German troops armed with MG Spandau machine guns.Lees was known as “Wild Man” after a series of solo sabotage missions in Yugoslavia earlier in the war.Just , he was already a battle-hardened veteran of the SOE, the shady unit for “ungentlemanly warfare” PM Winston Churchill ordered to “set the lands of the enemy ablaze”.Lees took that command and ran with it, installing himself as de facto leader of a group of partisan fighters in northern Italy.His unlikely cadre of warriors hailed from all over the globe — Spaniards, escaped Soviet PoWs, former members of the French Foreign Legion, Italian freedom fighters, German defectors and a Dutch soldier who carried a long-handled ice axe.Damien said: “Lees could scrape together  irregular fighters, all speaking a dozen languages.”Often unkempt and bearded, ­sporting mismatched unorm, it was the ­British officer’s job to mobilise them into a force to be reckoned with.Needing a juicy target, Lees set up a network of spies to gather information on enemy positions.He enlisted the help of several ­gorgeous Italian women, who could use their feminine charms to ­hoodwink the enemy.Lees nicknamed them his ­stafettas, meaning messengers.Through one of them he learned of a secret Nazi base that was a key stronghold in the Gothic Line — miles of machine gun nests, trenches and minefields, bunkers and artillery positions, running from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic.It was strung together by  miles of barbed wire. The harsh winter was setting in and Allied losses were mounting.The push into Europe was stalling until a foolhardy German officer was a little loose-lipped during pillow talk.One of Lees’ stafettas ed from their romantic encounter with ­information about a previously unknown German command centre.The Nazis had set up a base at Villa Rossi in Botteghe, the HQ of five corps and the th Army.Field Marshal Kesselring was a regular visitor and taking it out would wreak havoc with Nazi communications.It was an ambitious target — but Lees couldn’t resist.Needing backup, he called in the SAS. Major Roy ­Farran was a legend, shackled to a desk job after being deemed too valuable to risk.As Farran’s team packed their parachutes and prepared to meet Lees behind enemy lines, he insisted on going up in the plane.When the moment to deploy came, Farran “accidentally” tumbled from the plane. Luckily, he happened to be wearing a parachute.Damien said: “He told the air crew to report he fell out by accident, so HQ believed him dead. Once he radioed in to ask for airdrops of supplies and weaponry, they realised what he had done. But they couldn’t get him back from behind enemy lines.”Farran and Lees were kindred sprits who hit it off at once. They started preparing for the assault.Damien said: “Farran understood the Italian mentality. He had unorms dropped in, complete with hackles — feathers in Italian colours to wear in their berets. He made them feel part of something much bigger. He made them feel they could pull off this impossible mission and survive.”He issued the men with shoulder flashes saying “Chi osera vincera” — Italian for “Who dares wins”.After a -hour march, the  fighters arrived at the German base, on the night of March , .In a final flourish, Major Farran had “Mad Piper” David Kirkpatrick parachuted in, wearing a kilt.In the darkness, the stirring sound of Highland Laddie rang out, mixing with the rattle of machine gun fire and the thud of mortar shells.Damien said: “The Germans had become very brutal in their reprisals against the Italian resistance.“Bagpipes are quintessentially ­British — so the Germans had to accept it was a British raid, so they wouldn’t burn Italian villages and kill hundreds in revenge.”Incredibly, the rag-tag team pulled it off. Fuelled by benzedrine — an amphetamine — they killed around  senior German soldiers and burned their base to the ground.Damien explained: “They took no prisoners. This was not ‘do or die’ — it was murder most brutal.“Success would shorten the war and save thousands of Allied lives.”The attack blew a gaping hole in the German line.Lees was shot five times and was carried to safety on a makesht stretcher. As his force dashed for the safety of the mountains, hunted by hundreds of German troops, Lees was smuggled through checkpoints in a stolen German ambulance.The injuries haunted Lees for the rest of his le but Operation Tombola was an unqualied success.Incredibly,Lees and Farran had listened to orders from HQ, the attack would never have gone ahead.The pair had been ordered to call off the assault moments before setting off for Villa Rossi.British authorities were worried about Communist ­leanings in the Italian partisans and were reluctant to empower them. ­Farran and Lees decided to go ahead, risking court martial on their .Damien said: “They knew they could never raise the fighters to this level of enthusiasm again.“Like Nelson, they decided to turn a blind eye.”After Tombola’s success, Farran avoided court martial and was decorated by the US. But Lees got nothing — though Farran recommended him for the Military Cross.Damien said: “Lees was languishing in hospital. He was hung out to dry.“Not only was his Military Cross refused, he was ­savaged by his peers and accused of insubordination. But he never showed any bitterness.”With the backing of Lees’ daughter, Christine Bueno, , Damien has launched a petition ­urging Parliament to award Lees the medal he deserved.Christine, who lives in Blandford, Dorset, said: “My father wasn’t a bitter man but the fact remains, he deserved a medal. He was motivated by one thing, always — to do the right thing.“I’ve lived with this all my le. I was born a year after Operation Tombola. My family would be thrilled to bits for him to get the medal.This is a man history has not recognised. What he achieved unquestionably saved lives.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with a new blanket of cloud covering the far north.The coldest areas set to see -C on the mercury will be areas around the Severn Estuary and Somerset, with the Avon Valley and South Wales mainly affected.Forecasters warn a Big Freeze from Russia will cause temperatures to plunge even further for the next three months - with the UK on track for the coldest winter on record.A chart by MetDesk predicts that by mid-January just about everywhere will be blasted by snow.Experts also said the deep freeze could continue for months - with below average temperatures all the way to spring.Met Office spokesman Simon Partridge said when a similar three-month forecast was issued at the start of last year - those predictions came starkly true.He said: Last year there was widespread snow across many parts of the UK and temperatures were well below.Theres a higher chance of seeing colder spells, and given that, as a result, theres a slightly higher chance of snow across the UK.Its far too early to say in any detail, it might be that parts of Scotland which usually get snow will get more, or you might see snow sp widely.An update on forecasters at Meteogroup said that tonight will see freezing fog rolling in to western parts.It said: It will be a dry night for most, although north-east England and south-west Scotland could have some light drizzle.Wales will have patchy fog or freezing fog.Winds will be light and this will allow for a fairly widespread sharp frost across inland areas.The Met Offices forecast for the middle to the end of January paints a much colder picture, with forecasters warning of a higher than usual chance of ice in January.A spokesperson said: It is likely start unsettled across most areas at first, with heavy rain and gales at times, especially in the north, where severe gales are possible.Hill snow is also possible, as well as snow to lower levels at times in the north.By the third week of January there is then an increased likelihood of a change to much colder weather generally, bringing an enhanced risk of frost, fog and snow.These conditions may then continue to the end of the month, but some milder, wet and windy interludes also remain possible throughout this period.Meanwhile, with fears another “Beast from the East” is on its way, Coral make it odds on at -

a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labours members want, and it doesnt reflect the views of most Labour voters either.The work was carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project.If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - some  per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain,  per cent said they would leave with Theresa Mays deal and  per cent would support leaving with no deal.If the choice was between the Prime Ministers deal and leaving the EU without an agreement, some  per cent of Labour members said they would boycott the vote altogether, although  per cent said they would take Mrs Mays deal.Some  per cent of Labour members - compared with  per cent of current Labour voters and only  per cent of all voters - are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.While just  per cent of the electorate as a whole believe that warnings of short-term disruption with potential problems for food and medicine supplies in a no-deal Brexit are realistic, that figure rises to  per cent of Labour members and  per cent of Labour voters.HALF of Brits believe their personal finances will remain the same or improve this year.A new poll reveals people are defying gloomy Brexit forecasts -

About time too. But still, it’s progress.And there is no doubt that ­attitudes to women are changing.We’ve got a second female Prime ­Minister and a female playing the lead in Doctor Who.And women are rising up. We are organising, ­protesting, shaming and building power.We are making the women’s movement central to everyone’s conversation. Women are finding their voice.And the most important thing is we are getting heard.We are not going to accept mansplaining or being ­spoken down to “stupid woman”.Feminism is the word of the year, with more and more women standing up for themselves and demanding equality, and I predict that process is going to continue in .Now that I think about it, there were other good things about .It was the year we rediscovered hope in football during the World Cup.We did better than we thought we would — and it’s not often we can say that.The England team and manager Gareth Southgate restored our ­national self-esteem and gave us something to cheer about when there really was not much .The World Cup showed us nice guys can win.Sure, we didn’t bring home the trophy but it’s fair to say Gareth Southgate’s a winner in everyone’s eyes.And it’s not over yet:  is the women’s football World Cup — so that’s something to look forward to with hope.Hope is an important word. And now, more than ever, we need to find a way to hang on to the things that make us feel optimistic about the future.There were other hopeful things about .This was the year that gave us the breath of fresh air that is Meghan Markle — and it also saw the most stylish royal wedding this country has probably ever seen.Meghan was a signier of change for the Royal Family, which needed to modernise.And while I know some people have decided she is “pushy”, or criticise her for her relationship with her father, I think Meghan is one of the best things that has ever happened to our royals.We also had a royal baby — Prince Louis — and now we have another one on the way, which is happy news.My personal highlight of  was having lunch at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.It really was a wonderful occasion, spending intimate time talking to such an inspiring woman.And now here we are, poised on the brink of .I’m not a New Year’s Eve ­person.

The party leader has resisted growing calls to back another EU referendum, instead calling for a general election and promising to strike his own Brexit deal with Brussels. But a study of Labour members found % want the chief to get behind a second vote, while % of Labour voters also want him to support another poll. Professor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said: Our survey of Labours grassroots clearly shows that Corbyns apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labours members want, and it doesnt reflect the views of most Labour voters either.  The party leader spent  years criticising Brussels before switching to support Remain when he seized the Labour reins in . Critics blasted what they described as his lacklustre campaigning – contrasting it with his enthusiasm during the  general election battle. Mr Corbyn is committed to seeing through BrexitLabour wins power. But todays poll suggest tens of thousands of party members could quit over the leaderships approach to leaving the EU. Some % oppose the partys Brexit stance - and % of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting. That would be equivalent to around , members, according to the projects analysis.  Nearly a quarter - % - of Labour members blame Mr Corbyns failure to back a second referendum down to a belief he secretly supports Brexit. If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - % of members would back Remain, % would leave with Theresa Mays deal and % would support quitting without an agreement. If the choice was between the Prime Ministers pact and leaving without a deal, % of Labour members would boycott the vote. But % said they would take Mrs Mays deal. Some % of Labour members - compared with % of current Labour voters and only % of all voters - are convinced leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.  Prof Bale added: “Our survey suggests Labour’s membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end. “It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the party’s members on either count, are in the same camp. “Labour’s grassroots clearly hate Brexit, and although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU. “As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labour’s leader to get off the fence.” A party spokesman said: As unanimously agreed at Labour Party conference,Theresa Mays botched Brexit deal is voted down in Parliament then a General Election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference,the Conservatives block a General Election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.

Punctuality plunged to a -year low in  after  months of delays, cancellations and overcrowding on many lines. Yet thanks to todays hike, commuters will be paying nearly pound, a year more to travel to work than in . As protesters gathered at stations around the country today, an analysis by the TUC reveals British commuters spend up to FIVE times as much on their season tickets as their counterparts in Europe. At the same time rail firms have paid a staggering pound billion to shareholders in the last six years, which the TUC says is “rewarding failure.” Scroll down for the  steepest season ticket rises since  - and examples of how common season tickets are up this year  Yet shameless Tory Transport Secretary Chris Grayling blamed rail workers for demanding better pay. Jeremy Corbyn branded the rise a disgrace and a shame and said Labour would bring railways back into public ownership. He added: Our railways system should work for the interests of everybody, not just the profits of a few. Research by Labour of  routes shows the average commuter will now be paying pound, for their season ticket, pound more than in  and average fares have risen three times faster than wages.  The highest increase was on a Virgin Trains season ticket between Birmingham and London Euston which has risen by pound, since  and now costs pound,. But the biggest percentage increase identied was between Thame Bridge Parkway, near Walsall, West Midlands and Nuneaton, where the cost of an annual season ticket will have risen by % since . In Prime Minister Theresa May’s own constituency the cost of an annual season ticket from Maidenhead in Berkshire to London Paddington has risen by pound since .  Regulated fares, about % of all tickets, are rising by an average of .% while the average rise for all fares including unregulated ones is .%. Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, claimed passengers are being given another kick in the wallet following a terrible year on the railway. Andy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said:“Today’s rail fare increases are an affront to everyone who has had to endure years of chaos on Britain’s railways. “Falling standards and rising fairs are a national disgrace. The Government must now step in to freeze fares on the worst performing routes.  “Labour will bring our railways back into public ownership so they are run in the interests of passengers, not private profit.” The amount by which train companies can raise regulated fares, which include season tickets and most other commuter tickets, is the responsibility of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. He has the power to enforce this but has done nothing. Labour has committed to keeping fares down and pegged to no more than a rise of the Consumer Price Indexrather than the Retail Price Index , which is used by the government even though it is no longer an official measure of inflation. Labour has also called on the government to freeze rail fares on the routes most severely affected by the timetable changes - Govia Thameslink, Arriva Rail North and First Transpennine Express.  The timetable changes last May plunged busy rail routes in the North of England, London and the south east into chaos for weeks and led to calls for ‘failing’ Graqyling to resign. Meanwhile, the TUC said its analysis shows that rail fares are rising faster than wages for the ninth time in the last decade.

She’s scared thatshe travels to see her family in Dundee, she won’t get back into the US, which she now calls home. Elizabeth has been fighting Henry through the courts for a mutual orce settlement that would allow her immigration status to be claried. She said she was duped into signing annulment documents but launched the court battle after realising that the papers offered no clarity about her right to stay in the US. Elizabeth fears she will be unable to convince immigration officers of her right to stay in the country as she has no official documentation from her orce. Her case has been repeatedly thrown out by judges and the courts say the case is closed because the marriage was annulled. Elizabeth claims the marriage was annulled illegally because she thought she was signing immigration documents relating to her residency. Several lawyers have tried and failed to fight her case. She told the Daily Record: “I have built a le for myself here and made friends. I want to fight for a legal orce from my husband and need the courts to help me. “I want to be able to come home and visit family but I’d have to answer to immigration before I’d be allowed to leave and probably won’t get back in. “My mother died two years ago and I couldn’t even come home. “I can’t remarry. I can’t work legally here and I can’t get any health insurance. I’m stuck.”  Elizabeth worked as a babysitter for Henry, looking after his children following the death of his we, when they struck up a relationship. They got married in Scotland and she said her husband assured her he had registered her arrival in New York and their marriage – but never did. She added: “He is an American citizen, born in Brooklyn. “His we had died. He had two young twin boys and I met him through an advert for a live-in babysitter. “I was his babysitter for four years prior to marrying him. “I never thought that he would do this to me. I believe he basically just wanted me to raise his kids. “He was supposed to register me and our marriage in the US. “When the marriage broke down, I ended up staying in a shelter for the homeless. “I never existed officially in the States until .” Elizabeth is only able to stay in the US as an “abused spouse”. She has shown the Record letters from a lawyer in the UK, which state it is unlikely that her marriage can be annulled in the US. Elizabeth, who is living in a friend’s home and supporting herself by doing upholstering and cleaning, complained to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct over the case in . She said: “I tried to file another appeal about two years ago. I hired five attorneys and none of them have been able to do anything. “I can’t get anything to immigration to prove my status and I need the court to take this up so I can finally get some answers.” The Daily Record tried to contact Henry but did not receive a reply.

A study of , adults shows the majority of us won’t start ing properly until almost a full working week has passed. Re-adjusting to early mornings, the mountain of work which has piled up over the festive break and having to deal with challenging clients all take their toll in early January. Others find it hard to get in the mood for exercise, knowing when they do go to the gym it will be packed with people on a New Year fitness kick. The study, commissioned by working animal charity SPANA, found for one in six Brits, the feeling of having nothing to look forward to also means they struggle to get back into their normal routine. Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive of SPANA, which provides free veterinary treatment to working animals in developing countries around the world, said: “Going back to work after time off can be a shock to the system – especially after a sustained period of parties, lie-ins and relaxation.  “However, most of us are fortunate to be ing to jobs that we feel comfortable in, with decent colleagues and reasonable working conditions. As the holiday hangovers kick in, it’s important to keep some perspective and remember that our working lives could be unimaginably worse. The study found  per cent of adults reckon they suffer from the January blues, and  per cent said that during the early part of the month, they’ll only be at work in body, but not in mind. Three in  workers said they’re fully expecting work to be awful in January because they know they can’t have any time off for a while, while a fth said they’re likely toto a big work load. And a quarter are not looking forward to the likelihood that everyone  will be miserable about theto work. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more than a fth of adults have considered calling in sick for the first few days back to work, while more than half are expecting to feel sad the evening before their first day. Researchers also found almost half of those polled have no intentions of making any social arrangements in January. When asked why,  per cent said they would be too grumpy, while a third say they’ll have no money. A lack of cash also means Brits are unlikely to go shopping in the January sales, and won’t do anything of any interest until the first pay day of .  The fact there are still months left of winter to go, feeling tired and sluggish and having to endure rubbish television are other major reasons adults find January a chore. Brits also don’t like the fact social media is full of weight loss plans they can’t relate to, and everyone is doing dry January. Dennis added: “It’s a very dferent story for working animals overseas. These animals have no holiday or retirement. Day-in, day-out, they work in punishing environments, carrying backbreaking loads, often without the rest, water and vital veterinary care they need.” “Working horses, donkeys, camels and other animals in developing countries often endure short, painful lives, in brutal conditions. This global workforce of  million animals must work every day to help their owners earn a small income and put food on the table. Without these hardworking animals, many of the world’s poorest communities would have nothing. “These animals are unsung heroes, but they desperately need our help. That’s why SPANA’s work is important – ensuring that the welfare of working animals is improved and that they receive the veterinary treatment they urgently require when they are sick or injured.” TOP  REASONS BRITS STRUGGLE TO GET BACK IN THE SADDLE . The weather is horrible. The days are still short and dark. There are still months left of winter to go. You feel tired and sluggish. January feels like the longest month of the year. The excitement of Christmas has passed. Re-adjusting to the boring routine of everyday le   the daily grind. Feels like ages before you will have any time off work again. You feel like theres nothing to look forward to. You find it hard to motivate yourself to do any exercise. You have eaten so much over Christmas you find it hard to stop. The TV is rubbish. You cant do anything of interest until January pay day. Youve picked up an illness after Christmas. You can no longer blame the holidays for eating drinking too much. All the work you said youll get back to after Christmas is too much. You cant be bothered to take the tree decorations down  . January sales means you want to spend more money - but then you realise Christmas has left you broke, so youre depressed again. You feel like youve socialised enough over the Christmas period to last a letime - hence seeing any more people is just effort. Clients and customers are a challenge to work with. The gym is packed with people on a new year fitness kick. Kids are also struggling to get back into routine. Everyone  seems to be back on it, but you arent quite ready. Social media is full of weight loss plans and New Years resolutions that you cant relate to. No point in going out - as everyone is doing dry January.

Father Peter Weatherby posted a video on Twitter of the yellow coloured sewage all over a busy main road in Cannock, Staffordshire. He wrote: Raw sewage currently pouring down Walsall Road in Cannock. It is across both sides of the carriage outside Aldi and smells horrendous! Drivers were forced to swerve around the river of diarrhoea. The spillage is being blamed on a fatberg caused by an excess of wet wipes being flushed down the drain and clogging the pipe.  A spokesman for water services company, Severn Trent, said: We were made aware of a potentially burst sewer late this morning and we sent out a team as a priority. There is nothing to do with a burst sewage pipe, it was blocked by a fat and wipes. Severn Trent Water has assessed the main drain pipe and need a heavy jetting machine which has been ordered and the blockage will be cleared up tonight.

The Albion in Grimsby was once a thriving watering hole which was popular with the towns dock workers before closing eight years ago. But shocking new pictures show how the pub has become den for hardcore drug users after falling into disrepair. Stacks of used needles lie strewn across the tables where drinkers used to sit and chat, GrimsbyLive reported . The core of the pub is still recognisable as the furniture and ornate features remain intact but the onslaught of unwanted visitors has now taken its toll after nearly a decade of neglect.   Intruders have broken makesht holes through the roof and have have ripped up the floorboards in search valuable copper. The building itself now faces the wrecking ball as the once-grand Edwardian structure continues to rot. The pubs owner, Surrinder Mehat, says he feels he has no option but to tear it down and start from scratch. Architect Terry Litten risked his le detailing the state of building ahead of a new planning application to replace it with a three-storey-block of flats.   I have been in the business  years and I have never seen a building as drug infested as that, he told Grimsby Live after his brave venture inside. I could get a bath full of needles. Not a bag full, a bath full. I am being dead serious. His photos show chunks of plaster are splattered across the carpet.  More dangerous items such as discarded needles of almost every colour pile high on windowsills and are in hidden cracks and crevices. Doors have been stripped off their hinges to become beds while a Heinz Beanz tin, a scrunched up box of Kellogs Cornflakes and a bottle of Tesco Everyday Coke provide evidence of recent break-ins. I didnt want to stand in there long because half the floor was missing, said Mr Litten.  Theres only very few bits of floor left. They lted all that to get the copper wire. They were sleeping on the floor or on doors they had take off the hinges. They had broken in through the roof in some cases. He added: You just cant keep them out. My client lives away. Theres just no way he can deal with it.  Its a wonder no one has got killed, especially when they will be walking round half cut. An application to demolish the pub and build eight flats on the site is pending consideration by the local council. A final decision is expected in January.  The developer states the serious risk posed by the condition of the property prevents a detailed inspection of the its historical features. He added that the loss of the building would be an enhancement to the area as a whole.

After delivering a damning Christmas message, where she said even the Grinch had a heart, Samantha urged Meghan to begin  by thanking their father Thomas. She also said the Duchess of Sussex should eat more chocolate to sweeten her disposition. She told the Daily Star Online, speaking directly to Meghan: “Your New Year’s resolution should be to be honest and pay tribute to those who have helped you the most such as your dad.  “Thank him for your college education, your career, building every stage you set foot on, but really appreciate the people that care about you. “So many people around the world don’t have anyone who cares about them and hopefully you will count your blessings and reflect moving forward in the new year and pay that gratitude forward to your children so that they also thank you.  “It all comes full circle... it started with dad, and you can carry on the legacy.” In another cheeky dig at her sister, Samantha added: And of course I would add to eat more chocolate to sweeten your disposition for the new year.  Earlier this week, it emerged that Samantha has been placed on a fixated persons watchlist after being flagged as a reputational risk to the royals.

She was just , struggling to fit into a size  and already feeling like she’d wasted her young le. At st lbs, she weighed the same as her age – and didn’t have the confidence to do anything her fellow teenagers were doing. She’d pulled out of girls’ holidays, stopped going on nights out and was even embarrassed to hold her boyfriend Sam’s hand in public. But now all that has changed – because Lucie is literally less than half the woman she used to be. Now a trim st lb, she loves nothing more than dressing her tiny size - frame in slinky dresses. And last summer she wore a bikini for the first time in her le on a Spanish holiday. “I have lost st lbs and feel like a completely new woman,” says Lucie, now .“I missed out on all the fun and excitement my teenage years should have been – going on nights out and on holiday – because of my weight. “So I didn’t want to ruin my adult le by being obese.” Lucie, a teaching assistant for special needs children, realised just how awful her le had become shortly before her th birthday in August . She had been living as a recluse, scoffing her favourite junk food because she felt too ashamed to go out. Her friends started asking what she wanted to do to celebrate her birthday – and she realised the answer was nothing.  “Finding something to wear, then getting the confidence to go out, and then hearing remarks from people when I finally plucked up the courage to go out was too much,” says Lucie. “Strangers would make comments about what clothes I was wearing and how they didn’t suit me and weren’t flattering. “My friends eventually stopped asking me to go out with them because I would always just say no or come up with an excuse. “From the age of  to  I practically didn’t go out at all and I rarely went clothes shopping. I had lost all of those years. I didn’t have any le experience.” Lucie’s weight had started to creep up throughout her teenage years after she was diagnosed with asthma. It fuelled her appetite and she remembers losing all self-control. “Food was like a blanket for me, a comfort,” she says. “It never let me down. Whenever anything went wrong, food was always there for me. “The times when I did go shopping and couldn’t fit in anything, I would go to McDonald’s afterwards because I would feel upset, and then the whole vicious cycle would start again. ” Lucie, who is ft ins tall, didn’t even have the self-confidence to meet her boyfriend Sam’s friends and family.  They stopped holding hands in public because Lucie struggled to keep up with his walking pace. “Sam has been through this whole process with me and it just means so much to me now that he can be proud of me as his girlfriend,” she smiles. Now, over the space of  months, Lucie has done everything she has always dreamed of. Not only has she been on holiday with Sam’s family, she loves going to adventure parks, no longer worried she won’t be able to get involved in all the activities. Sam’s friends even joke that he’s got a new girlfriend. “It feels like we’re in a new relationship, like our relationship is just starting now – it’s so great,” she says. One of her biggest inspirations to lose weight and change her le was her mum Catrina’s own successful weight loss at Slimming World. She had shed three and a half stone and eventually managed to persuade Lucie to join a local group. Within her first week at the Paston and Gunthorpe club in Peterborough, Cambs, Lucie had lost five pounds and was over the moon. “I was clearly the youngest person there,” she recalls.“I was terried walking through the doors, but my mum was with me every step of the way. I was just so embarrassed that I was so young and I had let myself get that big.“It was so upsetting to get on those scales and see how heavy I actually was. “But everyone was so friendly and put me at ease straight away.” As her self-confidence rose, her weight went down.Her original goal was to lose six stone, but then when she had shed that she aimed for eight, and then she just kept on going.  “I found myself thinking, ‘Oh, this really isn’t too bad’ “Slimming World taught me how to adapt some of my favourite meals, such as fry-ups, burgers and fish and chips, meaning I could still eat them – so it didn’t really feel like a diet at all.“It didn’t feel like I was missing out on anything.” That’s one of the reasons Lucie has found it so easy to avoid falling off the wagon, even at Christmas time, by opting for healthy versions of her favourite festive treats. She’s also taken up exercise, which has been another learning curve. “I didn’t exercise at all throughout my weight loss, and my excess skin really hindered me going to the gym as I got a lot of sores,” she explains. “So me and Sam go on lots of walks to improve my fitness levels. “Generally, I can just be more active in my day-to-day le now. I don’t get out of breath walking alongside Sam, or playing with the kids at school, or walking up the stairs.” Lucie has replaced her food cravings with fun and adventure. She had a huge st birthday party, surrounded by friends and family. And while on holiday in Calpe, Spain, Lucie went to a waterpark and into the sea for the first time in her le, riding on a jetski. “It felt amazing not having to get a seatbelt clip on the plane and be able to sit in all the rides at the waterpark,” she says.“I look back at the last  years and feel really sad that I haven’t been able to have these experiences. “The only regret I have is that I wish I had lost the weight sooner. I finally have my le back.” Now Lucie is looking to the future, hoping to buy a house with Sam, , go on another holiday and maintain her weight.“When I look in the mirror now and then look at old photos, I just can’t believe how far I have come,” she says. “When I was big I used to say, ‘I wish all this fat would just disappear’. “And I look in the mirror now, and it has all disappeared. My target now is just to enjoy le – and make more crazy memories.”  LUCIE’s menu before Breakfast: McDonald’s or a fry-up Lunch: Two supermarket meal deals with two sandwiches, two packets of crisps and two full-fat Cokes or energy drinks Dinner: A pizza or Chinese takeaway Snacks: Pork pies, sausage rolls, savoury mini eggs, chocolate, sweets HER MENU After Breakfast: Weetabix with strawberries anda banana Lunch: Homemade pasta salad Dinner: Slimming World lasagne or American-style burgers and chips Snacks: Boiled eggs, fruit, ham slices, vegetable sticks"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather deep freeze begins","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Freeze begins TODAY as back-to-work Brits face icy - commuteMet Office forecasters are warning people to \"be prepared\" and leave extra time for journeys as cars and roads could be covered in a widespread frostShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video weather-forecast-first-week-january-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe UKs deep freeze begins TODAY as Brits ing to work after the festive period faced a spine-chilling - commute. Met Office forecasters are warning people to be prepared and leave extra time for journeys as cars and roads could be covered in a widespread frost. And the chilly start looks set to stick around, as meteorologists monitor the possibility of a longer period of arctic conditions - similar to last years Beast from the East which saw most of the country thrown into chaos. Forecasters are predicting conditions to get really cold, really quickly. Speaking about the chances of a second big chill, Met Office spokesman Simon Partridge said a similar three-month forecast at the start of last year was even harsher than expected.  He said: Last year there was widespread snow across many parts of the UK and temperatures were well below average. Theres a higher chance of seeing colder spells, and given that, as a result, theres a slightly higher chance of snow across the UK. On todays chilly start, Met Office forecaster Emma Smith said: Its going to be a pretty cold start to the day - temperatures were down to minus six in Scotland and there has been a quite widespread frost. Its dry out there so there wont be a problem on the roads - theres not much moisture around so obviously not much ice around. Theres only been a few patches of mist near the Scottish border, so its been quite a clear night in the sense theres not any fog. So itll be fine to drive to work, but it will be cold.  A low of minus C was recorded by the Met Office at Glasgow and Braemar in the early hours of Wednesday, while lows of minus Cwere recorded in North Wales and minus Cin the North West of England. Temperatures are expected to peak at around Cin London as the day wears on, with highs of Cin Manchester, Cin Newcastle and Cin Edinburgh. Ms Smith said: It will be a dry day and, throughout, the best of the sunshine will be in the west, mainly for Scotland, north-west England, Wales and the South West. For eastern areas, were looking at a cloudy day, and Northern Ireland is largely cloudy as well - but a dry day with really light winds.  It will be a lot colder than we have had recently. Temperatures in the north, for parts of Scotland, are not getting above plus onetoday and in northern England - Carlisle is plus two . Its going to be single figures really for much of the country, even in the south. Londons expected to get up to seven degrees, but quite a lot of places in the south are between five and six degrees for today - much colder than weve seen of late really.

Dean Lovell-Payne, , who was incapacitated by a fall this summer, took a massive overdose in September  after having to endure almost three months without receiving any benefits at all. Now Dean, his partner Paula and their three children Andrew, , Lou, , and Phoebe, , have been forced to move into a house in woods on the outskirts of Bournemouth which is only accessible by a dirt track, meaning wheelchair-bound Dean is effectively housebound. Despite pleading with the Universal Credit helpline, after the -week payment delay Dean said he felt he had no option but to take his own le during the call as he thought his le insurance would pay out more quickly. He received his benefits the same day after police are believed to have alerted the DWP to the incident and a spokesman for the DWP said they ‘sympathised with the distress he felt’. Do you have a Universal Credit story  Get in touch webnews@trinitymirror   The former ambulance worker, from Poole, Dorset, said: “Each and every day is horrendous. “I realised it was utterly hopeless and that my le insurance would be more likely to pay out in time to help my family than Universal Credit was. “I thought it was my only option to stop them suffering. “I took an overdose. “I didn’t even hang-up the phone. I told the soulless b*****d exactly what I was doing. “It seemed like the only way my family would be safe and no longer suffering, the only end to the hardship and insecurity. “The next thing I knew the police and ambulance arrived. “I survived the overdose because I had tolerance to the painkillers and sleeping tablets I had taken, by luck more than judgement. “But I am not the same person. I’m anxious, fearful and distrusting of anyone in the benefits system. “Although I survived, I don’t see much of a future for myself.”   Dean has been on benefits since  after he developed sepsis and global nerve and joint pain following an operation. Despite his health improving and being able to work part-time with the ambulance service, he suffered a major fall and subsequent infection in June which prevented him from walking. Forced to move to a cheaper home, Dean applied for Universal Credit the same month. But he said their new house, which is a converted motel in isolated woodland outside Bournemouth near Ringwood, Dorset, is totally inadequate for he and his family to live in. Dean said: “The access to the house is terrible. “It’s just gravel tracks and sometimes I feel like a prisoner in here. The house is very, very cold in the winter too. “Half the month we don’t have any heating because we can’t afford to heat the house.” But after going through the necessary checks, Dean was told that he would have to wait five weeks for the payment to be processed.

Episode two of US comedians Hasan Minhajs Patriot Act was removed after it criticised Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman over the alleged murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the kingdoms royal family, was killed at the the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Netflix confirmed to the Financial Times it had pulled the episode after receiving a complaint from the kingdoms Communications and Information Technology Commission that it violated Saudi anti-cybercrime law.  The streaming giant said: We strongly support artistic freedom and removed this episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request - and to comply with local law. The episode in question is reportedly still available in Saudi Arabia on YouTube.  In it, Minhaj criticises Saudi Arabia for Mr Khashoggis death and the countrys involvement in the ongoing war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has charged  people with the death of Mr Khashoggi, though strongly denies that the crown prince ordered the killing.  In December, the US Senate passed a resolution saying the crown prince is responsible for the death. Karen Attiah, Mr Khashoggis editor at The Washington Post, said Netflixs decision was quite outrageous. She tweeted: @hasanminhaj of @patriotact has been a strong, honest andvoice challenging Saudi Arabia + Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of #khashoggis murder. He brought awareness about Yemen.

At the moment we will have to suck it up and see what happens.”A spokeswoman for McDonald’s said: “Work will start early .”A number of objections were submitted to Aberdeenshire Council when the plans were first unveiled.The nearby Matalan store has said the McDonald’s restaurant would make the gull problem worse.The area is currently served by a number of food establishments including Domino’s, Ashvale and Subway.Mr Sharp added: “We have had assurances that McDonald’s is a business that looks after litter concerns and they send out their own teams to pick up and sort out any mess.“I do think the McDonald’s will be a welcome job boost in the area, especially with Homebase closing in Portlethen.”"},{"url":null,"title":"you need to know that it is ok to not be ok but you also need to know that there are people who can help","story":"People in the north-east have been urged to seek helpthey are struggling over the festive period.Police Scotland and Choose Le have asked anyone who may be stressed to get in touch with services available.Inspector Ian McKinnon encouraged people not to suffer alone.He said: “There are pressures to buy presents, family problems might come to the fore and there is an expectation that you should be happy just because it’s Christmas.#In reality it is the last thing some people might be feeling.“You need to know that it is OK to not be OK at Christmas – but you also need to know that there are people out there who can help.#Helplines such as the Samaritans and Breathing Space deal with numerous calls from people over this time soyou are feeling the pressure, take a time out and make a call, or use the Prevent Suicide appthat works better for you.“If you think someone you know looks low, ask them.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

how important this project is to Jedburgh which is why a public vote will be held to choose a winning name of this exciting community asset.ldquoWe look forward to further engagement with the community on this project next year, which will see this innovative facility move closer to completion.Work on the new campus is progressing well, with the frame of the new building - which will replace Jedburgh Grammar, Howdenburn and Parkside primaries - being installed.The games hall section of the new campus has been completed with work continuing on the atrium, canteen area and the nursery area.The campus will have provision for nursery, primary and secondary school children alongside further education.Community facilities will include a multi-use games area, a G hockey pitch, G

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-brexit-has-exposed-the-differences-between-the-scots-and-the-english","story":"If the main point was this latter one, the author failed to take account of the nature of this UK Prime Minister, who is as non-consensual as any I can remember ndash and that includes Margaret Thatcher. Also, let us not forget the entrenched position of the British Establishment to avoid PR, devolution ndash and federalism ndash in the UK.If, however, the authorrsquos main point was that England isnrsquot so dferent to Scotland, I would suggest that the article very clearly outlined signicant dferences which contradicted this assertion.First, in marked contrast to England, the leadership of all political parties in Scotland were united against Brexit ndash surely, a huge dference to be noted. Indeed, one of the most excruciating sights of the last two years has been to see Labour and Conservative politicians changing direction like little flags in the wind, as their English leaders have switched their Brexit policies from soft to hard to no-deal and back again.Secondly, the rural metropolitan split in Englandrsquos Brexit vote was stark, whereas the vote in Scotland was unormly Remain ndash we all remember that map ndash whether considered in terms of rural metropolitan, or north south, or even island mainland, for that matter.In summary, I would suggest that the conduct of the Brexit campaign, the result, and the subsequent analysis of the social attitudes which led to the result absolutely do show that the Scots are dferent to the English, at least so far as attitudes to the EU are concerned.Of course, the inevitable question for future discussion is how best to finesse these dferences.

This, after three years of everyone being told by David Cameron and everyone , including Theresa May, the Prime Minister for all her years in the job that it would be final. Not a single voice in any newspaper or anywhere  in the media, in all that time, has ever suggested that the democratic will of the people was only advisory, to be rejected by the House of Commonsit wished. These papers referred to have no credence, no validity, no force, for they have been over-ridden by the repeated statements of the referendum vote being sacrosanct by the current Prime Minister and her predecessor and accepted as such by everyone. Other papers have doubtless been omitted. That is how desperate the losers are to recover their position.Many have objected that the decision was wrong, but that it was the will of the people has been accepted for three years before the vote was ever held. These letters advancing the case of the referendum are the last-ditch defence of people who think they know better than the will of the people of the country. That arrogance has been demolished many times these last three years.We must leave and we must do so with honour. We must control our manner of leaving and not be bullied by the EU.

Scottish independence would be considerably more complex, and would be deeply damaging for our country.\"An SNP spokesperson said: \"We will fully and clearly set out plans for independence after the Brexit fog clears, and well ahead of any future referendum.\""},{"url":null,"title":"year-in-review-looking-back-at-a-bruising-2018","story":"It brought us Cuba without a Castro at the helm and Cambridge Analytica out of the shadows.In France the prevailing political colour was yellow, while across Yemen starvation remained an added predator in a war in which children were increasingly the victims.In all,  globally was a bruising year for the optimists and one that began and ends with a shutdown of the US government as Donald Trump the man who dominated the yearrsquos headlines continues to make them.As one New York Times headline put it earlier this month, for Mr Trump itrsquos ldquo a war every day, waged increasingly alone.That much was evident at yearrsquos end as US Defence Secretary James Mattis, the man many regarded as the ldquolast adult in the room of Mr Trumprsquos White House resigned over the Presidentrsquos abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan.As the New Year looms the US federal government is expected to remain partially closed in a protracted standoff over Mr Trumprsquos demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico.For many in Washington this parting shot of  and the standoff and political acrimony created is just another ominous portent of things to come in , a year in which the President will come under unprecedented pressure as legal investigations pile up around him.Looking back on  the US mid-term elections might just have marked the beginning of the end of Donald Trumprsquo presidency, but only time will tell.Overall Americans must have done a lot of soul searching last year as their country remained a fractured place and the scourge of another shooting took its toll on civilians in Parkland Florida.Elsewhere in the world it was no less turbulent as Moscow under Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly made its stamp on the global stage. Who can forget that wink from the Russian leader to his US counterpart at the start of the Helsinki summit  Who was not flabbergasted that Mr Trump then went on to side with Russia against the FBI over claims of interference in the  presidential election Both men are not known for being well disposed towards a free and unfettered media and last year was one in which threats to press freedom reached a new high.The brutal killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a chilling reminder of what media watchdog Reporters Without Bordersdescribed in wider terms as hatred whipped up by ldquounscrupulous politicians.Mr Khashoggirsquos murder shocked the world and put the country, and its young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under closer international scrutiny.If there is an upside to this terrible story itrsquos that perhaps at least it helped bring pressure on Riyadh over its prosecution of the Saudi led coalition war in Yemen.This month ldquomilestone peace talks began in Sweden and the hope is they will help bring about an end to a war that has resulted in  million people or half of Yemenrsquos population now needing aid to survive.But Yemen is not the only place in  that saw humanitarian agencies placed under enormous pressure. As I write Indonesia again reels from a deadly tsunami, an eerie reminder of the terrible Boxing Day disaster back in .In Democratic Republic of Congo too an Ebola epidemic that has taken grip is itself a devastating repeat of a similar outbreak in West Africa in .In the Middle East so often a crucible of suffering there was some good news as Iraqi voters flocked to the polls in  for the first time since driving out the Islamic Stategroup in  after the Iraq civil war.It was signicant election for the country as Iraqis were given the power to decide their future with the potential to sht the balance of power and mend isions between ethnic groups.That said, the jihadists of IS continued to pose a considerable threat in  with many analysts suggesting they were reconstituting their forces and establishing a network of cells to pursue a guerrilla insurgency both in Iraq and neighbouring Syria.Elsewhere around the world Islamist-inspired terror cast its shadow. In Europe, France once again bore the brunt, most recently when -year-old Cher Chekatt, armed with a gun and kne near Strasbourgrsquos famed Christmas market killed two and injured another  people.The terror attack came at what was already a turbulent moment for France as one of the yearrsquos most ldquovisible political phenomena, the gilets jaunes or yellow vest movement took to the streets in a challenge to French President Emmanuel Macron.Ugly as the scenes in Paris have been, in terms of international stories this past year, the gilets jaunes protests against what they see as financial exploitation by the Francersquos privileged metropolitan elite, captured the imagination of many around the world.It was a year also in which we witnessed a backlash against big tech. More people in  have access to the internet than safe drinking water.But as the worldrsquos digital population continues to grow there are fears not everyone is reaping the so-called ldquodigital idends of this transformation.The story of how researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to  million people before sharing some of it with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in our digital online age. Perhaps refreshing then to recall that heroic story earlier in  in which a team of young football players and their coach survived for  days before being extracted by cave rescue ers inThailand.Tragic as the death of one courageous rescuer was, how unusual it was to follow a story with a largely happy ending. Rare also to have one that caught the imagination and universal concern of people in a world otherwise riven with ision.Yes, all in all  was a bruising year for the worldrsquos optimists. But letrsquos not give up looking on the bright side.Perhaps, just perhaps,  might finally be the year when that ultimate hogger of headlines, Donald Trump, finally gets his comeuppance as special counsel Robert Muellerrsquos probe finally bears down.A Happy New Year to everyone when it comes."},{"url":null,"title":"national-records-cabinet-worry-over-dunblane-cover-up-theory","story":"Papers released by the National Records of Scotland show the Lab-LibDem Scottish cabinet discussed how to ldquoclose the story down and put an end to conspiracy theories in .It followed the sealing of a  police report into Hamilton for  years, fuelling speculation that it referred to his connections to prominent Scottish figures.Hamilton, who was known to local politicians, murdered  children and a teacher at Dunblane Primary School in  before shooting himself.As part of Lord Cullenrsquos inquiry into the massacre, some of the records relating to Hamilton were closed for  years to protect any child victims and their siblings.This included a  report by detective sergeant Paul Hughes of Central Scotland Police who investigated Hamiltonrsquos alleged physical abuse of children at a summer camp he ran.It recommended Hamilton be prosecuted for his behaviour, but Mr Hughesrsquos police superiors and the local procurator fiscal declined to take any further action.The Hughes report also recommended Hamilton should lose his firearms licence.Amid calls from the SNP and others to publish the full report, then Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC discussed the  year closure decision at the Scottish cabinet of  February .ldquoIf it was likely to be helpful in ending the speculation, he [Mr Boyd] would consider releasing an adapted report, the minute said.ldquoBut since it did not include the type of references suspected, it might lead to calls for other papers to be released.

His focus, however, would be on Transport, which he regarded as his primary job.ldquoHe had made it clear that he did not intend to do anything which could be done by the [Scottish] Executive.

Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-bit-of-an-annus-horribilis-for-nicola-sturgeon-and-the-snp","story":"It was a strange lull for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos party, the first year since  without an election or a referendum to animate it. Arguably, it was the first such year for a decade, given  was so dominated by the independence fight.It showed. The SNP lacked its usual dynamo.The absence of a campaign put the spotlight on to its record rather than its aspirations, and demonstrated why the First Minister and other politicians love a good contest.Making promises is so much easier than keeping them.After years in door-knocking mode, the SNP ranks got antsy. Where was the referendum they had been promised  Surely Ms Sturgeonrsquos talk of a ldquotriple lock mandate the previous year wasnrsquot just a piece of rhetorical thistledown Troubled by the listlessness at the top, the Yes movement took it on itself to organise.A series of marches organised by the All Under One Banner group brought tens of thousands on to the streets of cities around Scotland through the spring and summer.In the SNP deputy leadership race, Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny stood on an explicit  of a second referendum in .His rivals felt compelled to talk up the prospect of another vote too, although they were more circumspect about dates.Nor did the partyrsquos long-lost Growth Commission allay activist jitters when it finally appeared.Andrew Wilsonrsquos revised economic blueprint for independence was more curds and vinegar than milk and honey. The left of the party baulked at its hairshirt focus on deficit reduction and its plan to keep sterling.More tensions bubbled to the surface at the SNPrsquos October conference, with MP Angus Macneil telling his party not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby when they gave up their march on London.Other MPs suggested independence might arrive via an unidentied ldquodemocratic event rather than a referendum, given Theresa May refused to grant the latter.It was hardly a schism, but such shows of frustration and doubt with the leadership are rare in the modern SNP.Citing the delays and muddleover Brexit, the First Minister backed away from her pledge to give a ldquoprecise timescale for Indyref in the autumn, kicking her announcement into the New Year - for now - and making a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit her priority, even though another EU referendum would not leave enough time for a new independence vote before .By December, even Alex Salmond was questioning his successorrsquos appetite for a second referendum, wondering on his RT TV showthe ldquoCaledonian leboat would ever be launched.The former first minister was a key part of the SNPrsquos grim year. In January, two female civil servants made sexual misconduct complaints against him relating to .It would be another seven months, after an investigation overseen by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, that their existence would enter the public domain.When they did, the effect was explosive. Furious at the way the case had been handled, Mr Salmond launched a judicial review against the government he once led and quit the SNP after  years as a member,  as its leader, to spare it ldquointernal ision.It took him barely three days to crowdsource pound, to pay for the legal action.Ms Sturgeon publicly backed Ms Evans. Battle lines were drawn. Mr Salmond reportedly refers to his former protegee as Lady Macbeth and is gunning for one of her key aides.When the judicial review hearing starts at the Court of Session two weeks today, Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeonrsquos government will play for keeps. A polarising fight could see SNP members take sides. It is a moment the party should dread.The reorganisation of income tax into five bands, albeit under pressure from the Scottish Greens, was another bold change. Derek Mackayrsquos decision not to copy Tory tax cuts in England and Wales for the wealthy has continued the experiment, despite flak about a cross-border tax gap.But in education, Ms Sturgeonrsquos top priority, and in health, which consumes almost half the Scottish revenue budget, the Governmentrsquos record has been lamentable.There is no expectation that NHS waiting time or treatment targets will be hit any more. When the monthly stats come out, the only question is how badly they will be missed.Demonstrating how much tougher it is to run a delivery department than shuffle money, former finance secretary John Swinney has toiled in the education brief.In June, he was forced to halt his flagship school reform bill because of a lack of support. To give him cover for this woeful climbdown, Ms Sturgeon reshuffled her Cabinet the same day, getting shot of Shona Robison from health and Keith Brown from economy.But the excitement at the promotion of a new generation of ministers didnrsquot last long. In a blog written long before she became an MSP, Gillian Martin had written about ldquohairy knuckled, lipstick-wearing transgender laydees.Despite its existence being reported in , no one in government read it for the reshuffle. Ms Martin became the mayfly minister, in charge of higher education for a day, then gone. Ms Sturgeonrsquos judgment was put under the microscope and found wanting.Mr Swinney was also humiliated by MSPs voting against standardised testing for P pupils, and by some councils refusing to implement it.The first teachersrsquo strike in a generation is looming over pay.But as Ms Sturgeonrsquos deputy, he remains unsackable.At health, Jeane Freeman has come clean about problems she has inherited, writing off pound million of emergency loans to health boards they canrsquot repay and admitting ldquolegally binding waiting time guarantees will be missed until .However Audit Scotland continues to warn of cash problems in health as well as across local government, where reserves are being run down to an alarming degree.Itrsquos been no picnic on the railways either, with ScotRailrsquos performance hitting record lows, and Transport Secretary Michael Matheson impotently huffing and puffing at the franchise holder Abellio.Worse, he waived sanctions for their lousy service after accepting much of the blame lay with Network Rail, which is owned by the UK Government. The SNPrsquos plan to merge British Transport Police and Police Scotland north of the Border was aborted.As with much of Brexit, the fights of a few months ago, so intense at the time, seem dim and distant. In the spring, Ms Sturgeon and Michael Russell led a cross-party Continuity Bill through Holyrood to avoid a lsquopower grabrsquo of devolved competencies.But the Supreme Court effectively gutted it after a challenge by the UK government delayed its Royal Assent and allowed Westminsterrsquos EU Withdrawal Act to supersede it.Mr Russell also threatened to gum up the constitutional works by withholding consent for any Brexit-related Bill that came to Holyrood under the Sewel convention, then quietly backed down in the face of a Bill that was needed to give Scots health cover after Brexit.Despite all that, Ms Sturgeon remains a top-flight politician.In the last year, she has successfully portrayed Scotland as a beacon of stability amid the roiling chaos of Brexit. Her attacks on Jeremy Corbyn for vacillating over the biggest political issue in a generation have struck home. Her early emphasis on customs and single market continuity has been adopted by other parties.But turning the calendar on  will not put her problems behind her. The SNPrsquos basic plan in government ndash keep things simmering along inoffensively until therersquos a Yes vote ndash looks uninspiring and timid, even in its own ranks.Brexit also seems to have given voters their fill of constitutional upheaval. There is little appetite for a second independence referendum.The weary ldquowill she, wonrsquot she dance about the timing of another vote is likely to reach its anti-climax soon.If there is no general election or Peoplersquos Vote in , the focus on Scotlandrsquos public services will intensy, and it will not be to the SNPrsquos advantage.

I suppose thatrsquos made for more free-expression than last year, which seems only fitting just now given everything thatrsquos going on, and itrsquos been really gratying as dferent drafts have come in, and incredibly emotional as well. It really feels like this is what art should be doing right now.The writers include historian William Dalrymple, who takes an impassioned look at Scotlandrsquos relationship with mainland Europe against the backdrop of the Tron Kirk, brought to le by bespoke projection company Double Take Productions, and featuring a score from composer RJ McConnell.Bulgarian born and Highland-based non-fiction writer Kapka Kassabova will explore the origins of Europe alongside the even more dramatic Scottish Monument on Calton Hill. This will be accompanied by a score by Pippa Murphy, which is inspired by Greek, Mesopotamian and Gaelic female chanting, while images from Susannah Murphy and Cristina Spiteri of Bright Side Studios dissolve into the ether as time moves on.Leith Library is the setting for poet William Letfordrsquos touching reminiscences, with artist James Houston taking a typographical approach to illustrating the story. At Custom House, also in Leith, journalist Chitra Ramaswamyrsquos letter looks back to her childhood, holidays in Spain and le in Scotland with roots as a second-generation immigrant. Daniel Warrenrsquos accompanying film will mix archive footage and animation, and will feature a song by Emma Pollock.Up at the Cowgate, at the Bongo Club, playwright Stef Smith joins forces with composer MJ McCarthy and artist Eleanor Meredith for a moving tale of separation and broken hearts set to McCarthyrsquos ambient score and Meredithrsquos vivid watercolours. Over at the Tech Cube in Summerhall, fiction writer Louise Welsh pares things back to explore the international language of words themselves, with designer Emlyn Firth using typography to illustrate it.With a total of sixteen artists working on Message from the Skies, this multi-media fusion of form and content is itself an illustration of what might happenshared experience is used for the power of good.ldquoThe collaborations were the fun bit of it, says Glass. ldquoI spoke to each of the writers very early on, and started to try and get a feel for how they were thinking, and how they formally might approach things. Listening to that, you start to see and hear things that makes you think about what the end result might be, and to keep the authenticity of that you start to think about people from other artistic disciplines who might sit well within what each writer is doing, and you try and pair them up. People just wouldnrsquot have come into each otherrsquos spheres without this project, and you start to see and hear the words dferently.Glass doesnrsquot mention Brexit by name, but the shadow of the UKrsquos forthcoming departure from Europe looms large over Message from the Skies. Run in partnership between current Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers Underbelly, Edinburgh City of Literature and Edinburgh International Book Festival, and enabled by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Festivals Expo fund, the initiative also points up some of the problems which have already arisen regarding bringing artists from abroad to these shores.While the writers werenrsquot asked which way they voted regarding Brexit before they were commissioned, that should become clear from the work itself. There is little in the way of tub-thumping on display, however, with each piece humanised by the deeply personal tone of them all.ldquoDidactic is word thatrsquos been used a lot when wersquove talked about some of the big polarisations that exist when wersquore talking about Europe just now, says Glass. ldquoA lot of those conversations have been about the role of writers and artists in managing those conversations, and whatrsquos happened as wersquove gone along is that itrsquos become okay to make statements that are hard. There may be people who disagree with whatrsquos in a letter, but I think itrsquos still important to be able to make the space to have that conversation.The words written by the six writers taking part in Message from the Skies will live on regardless of what happens next, and can be published in book formdesired. The assorted artworks that bring those words to le have also been created with the same sense of love and care, and given the scale of the event, it is hoped that they too might have another le, crossing borders with their own unique sonic and visual languages as they go.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be brilliantthis could go across the world and other people could see it  Glass muses. ldquoWouldnrsquot it be wonderfulit could travel Message from the Skies, ious venues, Edinburgh, today-January , dusk-pm.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-hogmanay-review-concert-in-the-gardens","story":"Concert in the GardensEdinburghrsquos HogmanayNeil Cooper****The spirit of Glasgow club-night Optimo hung over the capital on a grand scale to see out  with a very hip spring in its step.While Optimo DJs prepared to man the decks alongside Chicago House queen The Black Madonna at Leith Theatre, Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay kick-started official celebrations with a mainstage triple bill headlined by Franz Ferdinand, one of the first of a post-millennium art-pop new wave to infiltrate the mainstream.That happened shortly after the bandrsquos first scheduled Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay appearance was cancelled due to high winds.Fteen years on, the same slot is taken by Free Love, the Glasgow-based duo of Suzi Rodden and Lewis Cook formerly known as Happy Meals.The euphoric storm of hippied techno whipped up by a barefoot Rodden and a beret-clad Cook on an analogue electronic kit flanked by a mini backdrop of psychic signs and symbols suggests biblical weather wouldnrsquot be a problem.Rodden revels in conjuring electronic zaps into the air inbetween singing in French or  breaking out into Lindsay Kemp style dance routines.

We could ask women what their intentions are for childcare, so we can find those who are going to be using grandparents. At the moment, women are not asked this.Almost a quarter of Scots children are overweight or obese by the time they start Primary One, while only three-quarters of Scottish children get an hour of physical activity each day.Age Scotland chief executive Brian Sloan said a ldquocommon sense approach was needed.He added: ldquoGrandparents should respect parentsrsquo dietary requests for their children but there should also be discussions to understand where and when a grandparent can spoil their grandchildren - whether through experiences or food.ldquoEach family dynamic is dferent.

ViewpointTHERE will be an early Christmas present for new mums and dads on low incomes across Scotland but the good news does not stop there...The first Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment will be made before the big day, it was confirmed, after applications opened on Monday.The payment will see eligible applicants receive pound for their first child, pound more than the DWP Sure Start Maternity Grant it replaces.The Best Start Grant also provides pound for all subsequent children ndash meaning there is no cap on the number of children it supports, unlike the current UK government equivalent.In addition, two additional early years payments will be introduced by next summer.The first pound payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further pound when they start school.Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \"I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support.\"I am particularly pleased that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister and had no support from the UK government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.\"With the Early Learning and School Age Payments this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide pound to pound more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.\"Thats a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this governments emphasis on the early years.\"Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Itrsquos a sad reflection on society, I feel.ldquoWe ought to be very thankful that wersquore free, because thatrsquos what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnrsquot be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.ldquoIt was all for a cause. People may say, lsquoOh, thatrsquos patriotic nonsense.rsquo But it isnrsquot.This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OrsquoGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118591.jpg","title":"Just the ticket for tackling debt","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointTHE Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what the organisations are.* For more information, visit www.creditunions.scotWednesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for a second referendum on Scotland’s future, then backed down in the face of popular uncertainty. But to use a dferent cliché, indyref was the dog that didn’t bark in .Sturgeon can’t be blamed for the UK Government’s failure to settle the outcome of Brexit in time for the SNP leader to offer clarity on a second Scottish independence referendum – but that won’t hold for long in . She will eventually have to show her hand.When that moment comes, it will offer her the opportunity to deliver some home truths to her own supporters: that there isn’t time or means to keep Scotland in the EUthe UK leaves, and that true shape of the relationship between Brussels and London may not be known until close to the next Scottish election in .The Government in Edinburgh insists it has a mandate for a new independence referendum from this Scottish Parliament. Butthe Sturgeon believes the public will back leaving the UK over the final Brexit deal, why wouldn’t she put that to the public in  and prove it Another hold-up might not be the message independence activists want to hear, but it may be the only way to convince the majority of Scots that the question needs to be asked again.The UK Government: Get back to delivering the milkIt’s been a busy two-and-a-half years for the Blitz spirit, invoked at every opportunity by Brexit campaigners. It should mean automatic disqualication from public debate to suggest that the privations of wartime Britain are something to aspire to for the future, rather than a lesson from the past.Nonetheless, helped along by a handful of recent blockbuster Hollywood depictions, Winston Churchill has been repeatedly dragged into debate on Brexit by both sides either in support of the myth that Britain has always ‘stood alone’ in Europe, or that European unity was a Churchillian idea. In our present situation, I personally find the most useful quote attributed to Churchill his reflection that: “Democracy means when there’s a knock at the door at am, it’s probably the milkman.”The comment is obviously referring to examples of brutal oppression by the undemocratic governments of his time, but it also reflects the truth that democracy, when it s, is in part the triumph of small freedoms and practicalities over the big, dangerous idea.Events have moved at such a pace that it’s been impossible to stop and ask where we are. But however you feel about Brexit, it’s clear that a government of a wealthy country forced to nationalise shipping capacity to guarantee supplies of food and medicine, not because of a natural disaster but a political event taking place in just three months’ time, isn’t a responsible government, but one that has already failed.It serves the interests of a narrow and extreme segment of opinion to raise the stakes and turn every issue facing the West into a test of national virility. It allows representative democracies to be hijacked by debates about honouring ‘national sovereignty’ and ‘the will of the people’, asthose weren’t deeply conflicted and debatable concepts.Churchill should be invoked not just to remind us of our finest hour, but of just how banal democracy is supposed to be, when it works well.EU leaders: Tackle anti-immigration agenda head-onEurope has challenges beyond Brexit to face in , and the continent will have to find its way without the certainty of Angela Merkel’s leadership.She offered the strongest, most consistent defence of European values in response to the wave of refugees from conflicts across the Middle East and Africa. Someone  will need to step into her shoes and ensure the anti-immigration narrative doesn’t metastasise into a yellow-vested popular movement that could disrupt upcoming national and EU Parliament elections.US Democrats: Remember who your enemy isIt seems crazy that, with the US Presidential election still almost two years away,  will be decisive in whittling down the field of candidates seeking to oust Donald Trump from the White House.The Democrats would do well to ensure that the process doesn’t turn into a bloodletting. The signs aren’t good, with backers of  left-wing challenger Bernie Sanders and  breakthrough candidate Beto O’Rourke tearing chunks out of each other on social media.Yes, the party needs to refresh its identity to try win back the voters that helped deliver Trump the presidency.But Democrats also need their whole coalition to back the candidate they eventually settle on – something they didn’t achieve in .So much of the political narrative across the West relies on the outcome of the  presidential election. Perhaps more than in any US vote in history, the eyes of the world will be on the Democratic Party. They need to get it right.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850831.1546358824!/image/image.jpg","title":"rail fare rise paying more for poor service leader comment","story":"Rail fares have soared in recent years and commuters may respond by taking to the roads, causing increased congestion and air pollution.There is something rather romantic about travelling by train. So much so that VisitScotland promotes “Scotland’s Great Rail Journeys” through some of this country’s most stunning scenery such as the West Highland Line from Glasgow to Mallaig and the trip from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh. This is rail transport at its finest, travel for its own sake, for enjoyment.But the ordinary experience of many Scottish commuters attempting to travel on more workaday routes is anything but joyful.Instead, delays and cancellations have become all-too-common – with ScotRail’s current problems recently branded “unacceptable” by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson in the Scottish Parliament. Those failings can have signicant knock-on effects on iniduals and the wider Scottish economy. Indeed, one Edinburgh shop boss last month went so far as to say he would never again employ someone who relied on trains to get to work because of the delays experienced by a key member of staff. That may have been an over-reaction, but the frustrations of those concerned are understandable to most people.: Alastair Dalton: How to find hidden cheaper rail faresAnd so it was hardly surprising when there was a chorus of outrage over the latest ticket price rises. ScotRail’s fares were due to go up today by an average of . per cent, while London North Eastern Railway’s fares were to increase by . per cent. Across the whole of the UK, the average rise is . per cent.An analysis of more than  routes by Labour found the average annual season ticket cost £,, up £ from , and that fares had risen nearly three times faster than wages.With UK rail travel already among the most expensive in Europe, commuters can be forgiven for complaining, particularly when the service is not up to scratch. Apart from delays, finding a seat on the most popular rush-hour journeys is often a struggle.The problem for those who travel by other means is that rail travellers may do more than complain, they could decide to switch to the roads, leading to increased congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.The railways are a vital part of this country’s transport infrastructure, playing a key role in the economy. Trains need to run on time except in the most exceptional circumstances.

Now senior party figures want her to make the same call on tuition fees, the Tory source said.“Ahead of the last election, we made the announcement on free prescriptions,” the source said. “The other big policy is tuition fees.“When voters decide on a change of government, it hasn’t been because the winners have offered total, radical change, but because they’ve represented a degree of continuity like Tony Blair in .”The source added: “There’s the issue of unfairness, with many young people not able to get a university place because of free tuition. People are waking up to that, but it doesn’t look like a decisive sht will happen by .”The SNP’s defining policy of not charging tuition fees for undergraduate courses remains popular. A poll ahead of the  Holyrood election found voters gave it a rating of . out of ten, behind only pledging to increase funding for the NHS.However, critics say it has failed to improve access to higher education for all. The participation rate on degree-level courses for -year-olds from the most deprived areas was twice as high in England in  as it was in Scotland.And opponents claim there is growing evidence that a cap on university places for Scottish and EU students means pupils with top marks are being unfairly shut out.Figures for  show , Scots failed to get a place at a Scottish university, equivalent to three in ten applicants. The figure is  per cent higher than when tuition fees were abolished.Responding to the figures yesterday, Tory education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: “The fundamental problem of the SNP’s free tuition remains the fact that there is discrimination within the system and an unfair capping system, which means that a ­signicant number of extremely well-qualied, Scots-domiciled students are unable to get a place.”Brexit could allow future Scottish Governments to end free tuition for the more than , EU students accepted at Scottish universities each year, easing that pressure.A policy review is being carried out by Tory MSP Donald Cameron to prepare a manesto for  that can put Ms Davidson into Bute House. However, the source told The Scotsman that university tuition policy was unlikely to change while Ms Smith remains in place, as she is considered a strong supporter of the principle of fees.An SNP spokesman said: “Just like on prescription charges, the Tories have railed against SNP policy for years, but now seem to be realising that their plan to whack a price tag on education is deeply unpopular.“The SNP scrapped tuition fees – in contrast with the Tories’ record in England where young people face tuition fees of £, a year.”A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: “As with every party, we are undertaking a policy review and we will set out our proposals in the run-up to the  Holyrood election.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises.

The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8745017.1545218388!/image/image.jpg","title":"double celebrations for stuffabusni toy collection","story":"Thanks to the generosity of the Northern Ireland public, thousands of children living in poverty across the province will receive presents this Christmas.For the second year in a row, Translink and U joined forces for the Stuff a Bus Toy Appeal, in aid of The Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Feins Constance Markievicz was ed in the  general election, but did not take her seat. The images, minus the three abstentionist MPs, are currently on show in the Houses of Parliament.Lady Hermon, who has represented North Down since , said she wanted her picture - captured in black and white - to be taken at the harbour in Donaghadee, which has been her home town since she married former RUC Chief Constable Sir John Hermon there  years ago.\"The day we had chosen to take the photos happened to be overcast and rather windy, and so we had to improvise by sheltering behind the sea wall at the harbour,\" Lady Hermon explained.\"As I sat on the seat looking out to sea, I was thinking about Jack... the moment I saw the photograph, it seemed the perfect choice.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\".

State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"7 people who already broke their new year resolutions by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park.

Electoral Office to scrap draft proposals that will result in people who live in Crossgar not being able to vote in the village at next Mayrsquos Newry, Mourne and Down Council election.Public consultation on the draft proposal mdash whichimplemented will mean residents have to make their way to nearby Drumaghlis or Killyleagh to cast their vote mdash ends today at pm.A revised proposal will then be published early in the New Year with a further  days then set aside for public comment before a final scheme is published.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews, who appealed to voters in Crossgar concerned about not being able to vote in their home village to respond to the consultation, hopes ldquocommon sense will prevail.He and a number of his Rowallane colleagues remain concerned that people who live within touching distance of the designated polling station at Glasswater Primary School, will have to make their way either to a church hall in Drumaghlis or Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The local politicians say it is somewhat ironic that people who live on the periphery of Crossgar will be able to vote in the village, but those who live in the heart of the village will not.They believe the Electoral Officersquos draft proposal is ldquoflawed and have warned it will particularly impact on the elderly and those who have no access to public transport.Cllr Andrews said the draft proposal will have a ldquodetrimental effect on the people of Crossgar and district.ldquoResidents in the centre of the village will have to bypass Glasswater Primary School polling station and travel three miles to vote in Drumaghlis or five miles the other way to Killyleagh, he continued.ldquoIn my opinion, this draft proposal is senseless, flawed and discriminatory and treats Crossgar residents like second class citizens. What do people who have no access to transport do when it comes to casting their vote Cllr Andrews said that with an estimated population of , people, voters in Crossgar were being treated dferently to those in Killyleagh, Saintfield and Ballynahinch.ldquoI hope this proposal will be revisited so people in Crossgar and the surrounding district can enjoy the right of exercising their democratic right to vote in their own village, something many others take for granted where in the district, he declared.ldquoThe bottom line is thatyou live in Crossgar and intend to vote in next yearrsquos council elections you will have to travel either three miles to Drumaghlis or five miles to Killyleagh which simply isnrsquot on.He added: ldquoI sincerely hope common sense prevails and that this ridiculous draft proposal will be consigned to the bin where it belongs.ldquoWhat is really ironic is that while people in Crossgar must travel outside the village to vote, those in areas including Annacloy and Bells Hill will be heading into Crossgar to cast their vote. You couldnrsquot make it up.Consultation responses should be forwarded to info@eoni.org.uk before pm this evening..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Review of recycling centres  ","story":"THE future management of the districtrsquos three household recycling centres will be discussed in the New Year.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is organising a special workshop on January  for all of the local authorityrsquos  councillors to consider a number of recommendations following a review of current operations in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan.Future access policies is one of the key areas which came in for special attention as part of the review which also examined a potential ban on taking black bin bags full of unsorted waste to any of the centres.Local authority officials have been carrying out an in-depth review of the operation and management of the centres with details of the exercise outlined last month when politicians were told that almost , tonnes of waste are taken to the districtrsquos three recycling centres each year.Councillors were also told that that the local authority is legally obliged to provide dedicated centres for household waste which are free to use.The centres are viewed as key weapons in the councilrsquos battle to reduce waste to meet a directive to recycle  per cent of all waste generated across the district by .

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning unsorted black bin bag waste which will have a signicant impact, given that thousands of people regularly empty a iety of waste into such bags and take them to the recycling centres.Elsewhere, council officials want to challenge the perception that the household centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.Officials say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the local authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling facilities.The review also examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive. The number of recycling centres and their opening hours will also come under the microscope during next monthrsquos workshop.The event will explore the reviewrsquos recommendations and agree an implementation date, with the agreed way forward to be mapped out at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s farewell to Hugh  ","story":"SPA Golf Club brought a unique six-decade era to a close on Saturday when its longest playing member Hugh Hegan left for pastures new.Club captain in  and president two years ago Hugh has been a keen and regular competitor on the Spa fairways since his father mdash also called Hugh mdash introduced him to the sport in .Captivated by golf from the very beginning, Hugh played to a handicap of two at his peak and along the way established himself as one of the leading contenders at Spa.Over the years Hugh, who now has a highly respectable handicap of , has won many trophies including the Spa Cup mdash as a teenager in lsquo mdash Captainrsquos Day events and represented the club on Senior Cup, Junior Cup and Ulster Cup teams.As he said farewell to his many friends at Spa, before leaving for St Andrewrsquos in Scotland with his we Anne to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, Hugh reflected on the changes to the club which he will always call home.ldquoWhen I joined it was just a nine-hole course at the old Spa.ldquoThe facilities were basic to say the least.

When the prediction was borne out they expressed surprise and tried to limit his appearances on television. Anyone with extreme views...can guarantee coverage on American television.“Adams played the game skilfully. He chose programmes with relatively large audiences but renowned for easy questions, notably Larry King Live and Good Morning America.”The embassy said that Mr Adams’ visit “was a set-back for our information effort”.“We have worked hard for the last  years to marginalise the IRA in the US. His mild manner and apparent reasonableness will have given him a new legitimacy with some innocents in the audience.“But we should not exaggerate this impact. The American attention span is short. Television was already bored with Adams after  hours and moved on to other stories. His failure to say anything new meant there were no follow-up stories.“Adams’s double-speak turned off interviewers and audiences and his accent proved impenetrable for many Americans. His impact may well turn out to be ephemeral.”SDLP-FF merger plan a ‘natural progression’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

The note said that Mr Flynn had articulated “warm support for the Government’s policy and the Secretary of State personally”.He also told Sir Patrick Mayhew that he recently met Gerry Adams for three hours: “He was ‘a man of honour and of peace’. But he faced a very dangerous and dficult step and not everyone would agree with an end to violence but he was convinced Adams was working to that objective”.Mr Flynn had also met UUP leader Jim Molyneaux and described him as a “good man” who had “a good face”.The Secretary of State said that Mr Molyneaux “had indeed taken signicant risks recently, but he was a cunning man who seemed to have got the mood about right...nevertheless, there was a good deal of unease and anxiety in the unionist community and Protestant paramilitaries were gaining in support and capability”.Sir Patrick said that the “main obstacle to political progress” was now the Republic’s territorial claim on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said that he did not believe that Gerry Adams had “undergone any moral conversion” and that “he remained a bad man who, for purely practical reasons, seemed to want to move away from violence”.He said that “the Government had operated on the basis that Adams wanted to move away from violence and that it should be made easier, rather than more dficult, for him to do so: Sinn Féin after all had a democratic mandate.”Sir Patrick was blunt that he had only one message for Mr Adams which was identical to what was being said publicly by the government and that while talks would be open to Sinn Féinthe IRA ended violence, they would not be allowed to hold up that process and talks would “go forward with or without them”.Mr Flynn died last June at the age of  and was described by Tanaiste Simon Coveney as someone who “showed real leadership in mobilising Irish American support for peace”.SDLP-FF merger plan a ‘natural progression’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
