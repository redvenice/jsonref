When I\u0027m older I\u0027m going to race Usain Bolt - and I\u0027m going to win\u0027. His dad Rudolph Sr said: \u0027At first he was bad. He came about 36th out of about 80 kids. That all changed when he realized you don’t get a medal for losing\u0027\u0027And when I\u0027m older I\u0027m going to race Usain Bolt - and I\u0027m going to win.\u0027Rudolph says his favorite thing about winning races \u0027is the medals.\u0027But what is it that people ask him about the most?\u0027They say, you really got a six pack? You really got a six pack?\u0027 the second grader replies with a giggle.          The Tampa, Florida phenom has set his sights on breaking the string of world and Olympic records held by the sport\u0027s greatest icon, Usain BoltAt four foot tall and weighing just 54 lbs, he will have to grow some to match the 2.44-meter stride that helped 6ft 5in Bolt conquer the world.But he\u0027s made an incredible start by sweeping the board in statewide and national competitions, bagging more than 50 medals and winning gold at the AAU National Championships for the past three years.In his first 100-meter race meeting of the season Rudolph - who takes to the track in a customized Blaze running outfit - recorded a personal best of 13.48 seconds.That figure beat the previous USA Track and Field record of 13.67 seconds for a seven-year-old and puts him on par with the best 11 and 12-year-olds in the US.\u0027He ran that race with a 100 degree fever,\u0027 said Rudolph Snr, 28, who acts as both his son\u0027s coach and media manager.\u0027I told him he wasn’t going that day but he said, dad I want it bad. He ended up shattering everything.‘His competitive spirit is through the roof. That\u0027s what makes him a champion.\u0027Rudolph Snr invited DailyMailTV along to the running track at Tampa\u0027s George D. Chamberlain High School to see his boy\u0027s incredible speed for ourselves.It was soon clear Rudolph had the confidence to match his prodigious pace, challenging our reporter to a race - then leaving him for dead.Even our drone struggled to keep up as Rudolph scorched out of the blocks and comfortably saw off the next challenge from his uncle, Jaylen Gaston, 25.           The schoolboy has bagged more than 50 medals and winning gold at the AAU National Championships for the past three years          Rudolph Snr traces his son\u0027s interest in athletics back to the 2016 Rio Olympics where Bolt added three more gold medals to his trophy room before retiring a year later. He said: \u0027Now he’s got a whole house full of medals and I can\u0027t remember the last time he lost at the 100 meters - it\u0027s been more than a year\u0027          Father Rudolph Ingram Senior aka Coach Kool (center) has drilled it in that only his hard work has got him where he is today as an all-round great running back and safetyRudolph Snr traces his son\u0027s interest in athletics back to the 2016 Rio Olympics where Bolt added three more gold medals to his trophy room before retiring a year later.‘When he was four he watched Usain Bolt in the Olympics on TV,\u0027 he recalled. ‘He was intrigued but he didn’t know too much about what was going on.\u0027The next morning he ran into the bedroom shouting “ready, set, pow!” then ran out again. I though, wow, he’s pretty fast.\u0027Blaze was four years old when he entered his first race and he was up against kids aged five, six and seven.‘At first he was bad. He came about 36th out of about 80 kids.\u0027That all changed when he realized you don’t get a medal for losing.‘Now he’s got a whole house full of medals and I can\u0027t remember the last time he lost at the 100 meters - it\u0027s been more than a year.\u0027Despite his incredible speed, it was actually football that sent Rudolph sprinting to global fame.He was played running back and safety for the Tampa Ravens at six, bamboozling older boys and scoring ten touchdowns on the season.\u0027The kid has vision like I’ve never seen in a six-year-old before,\u0027 his coach Jimmy Watson told reporters.\u0027One second he’s going one way and then you blink and he’s going another way.\u0027Video clips of Rudolph’s frantic footwork went viral and NBA megastar Lebron James was among those who shared the footage online.          Despite his incredible speed, it was actually football that sent Rudolph sprinting to global fame. He was played running back and safety for the Tampa Ravens at six, bamboozling older boys and scoring ten touchdowns on the season           He also got a sibling on the up - his little brother Kaedyn, four - who makes up for in raw talent what he lacks in a sense of direction. Nicknamed Mr Wrong Way, the tiny football player went viral himself last year for mistakenly running with the ball in the opposite direction before his coach caught up with him and managed to turn him aroundSince then the youngster has been featured on ESPN and invited to meet some of his biggest heroes, including Team USA star Gay and Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Kwon Alexander and Mike Evans.\u0027I honestly think he can be as good as any of them,\u0027 predicts his dad. \u0027I think he can make the Olympics and the NFL.\u0027He can be the number one nationwide in track and field or win the Heisman Trophy, whichever he chooses - he\u0027s that good at both.\u0027Away from the spotlight, Rudolph and his dad train three nights a week while sugary drinks and fatty treats have been benched.But Rudolph Snr, who ran track and field and was a linebacker at school, is adamant his son\u0027s sporting prowess won\u0027t come at the expense of his grades.\u0027I try to keep his life regular. Blaze is just a normal kid, he’s into Marvel, he likes Spiderman and of course The Flash,’ he told DailyMailTV.\u0027And I\u0027m as big on school as I am on track and football. He\u0027s all As and Bs.\u0027Blaze definitely understands that he\u0027s known and he\u0027s popular.‘I don\u0027t know if he shows off his abs at school but his teacher told me the ladies love him.‘But I always teach him to stay humble because when you get big-headed you lose your work ethic - and then someone comes along and beats you.\u0027My job is to keep him grounded. I\u0027m a coach, manager but above all else, I\u0027m his dad.\u0027  Ingram even has a fan in former NFL star Devin Hester (left) and Kwon Alexander (right)          Video clips of Rudolph’s frantic footwork went viral and NBA megastar Lebron James was among those who shared the footage onlineRudolph seems to be winning the race for a scholarship at one of his state\u0027s top schools, with Lane Kiffin, the football coach at Florida Atlantic University tweeting: \u0027Who is this kid??? Come to #thefaU!!!!!\u0027He also got a sibling on the up - his little brother Kaedyn, four - who makes up for in raw talent what he lacks in a sense of direction.Nicknamed Mr Wrong Way, the tiny football player went viral himself last year for mistakenly running with the ball in the opposite direction before his coach caught up with him and managed to turn him around.Showing similar flair to his older sibling, Kaedyn then sped past his opponents to score an unlikely touchdown.But what if Rudolph\u0027s prodigious talent simply fizzles as he fills out?What if he decides to become a fireman or a math teacher?\u0027My son is respectful, he\u0027s loveable, he\u0027s a great role model for his brother,\u0027 says mom Keyera Chaptman, 25, who ran track at high school and was a cheerleader.\u0027My dream for him is to be happy in whatever he wants to do. Whichever path he chooses I\u0027ll always be proud of him and support him.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Jennifer Lawrences fiance Cooke Maroney quiet popular girls high school","story":"    Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s fiancé Cooke Maroney was a \u0027quiet yet popular guy\u0027 who dreamed about owning a Bentley, former classmates have revealed          Gail Burkholder, a fellow 2002 graduate and now upholstery store owner, told DailyMailTV: \u0027I\u0027m not really surprised Cooke ended up with a celebrity. At school, he was a quiet yet popular guy who was friends with lots of girls.\u0027 The art gallery director was voted best dressed in high school  But long before he began dating the Hollywood star, Maroney was a \u0027sensitive jock\u0027 who shunned the limelight - but was popular with the girls at Middlebury Union High School in Vermont          The 34-year-old art gallery director, who began dating the Oscar-winning actress last June, was revealed to have popped the question after the pair were spotted celebrating in New York City earlier this month\u0027He is someone you can be yourself with. He\u0027ll spend a lot of time with you but won\u0027t talk s**t about you behind your back to other people.\u0027He was never a big fan of being the center of attention. He\u0027ll definitely do well with a big time actress and support her from the background.\u0027And for a big-deal New York City art dealer and gallery director, Maroney actually has an unusual background.He grew up on a 700-acre farm in Leicester, Vermont, a one-store town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie holding a VW Beetle high above its head.While he was born in Manhattan, Cooke\u0027s art dealer dad James and mom Suki wanted to taste some of America\u0027s off-the-grid living and moved north in 1986.They bought a giant windy hilltop property dubbed Oliver Hill Farm. The city slickers, said a neighbor, had no experience raising and maintaining animals but made a go at organic dairy farming with more than 250 heads of cattle.When they received the keys to their new kingdom, the neighbor added, they went through a three-year process to obtain organic farming certification, only the third in Vermont at the time.\u0027When they got here, everybody was rolling their eyes,\u0027 said neighbor Rodney Jerome, 72, who rents his 73-acre farm from the Maroneys.           According to the yearbooks leading to his graduation in June 2002, he wasn\u0027t a member of the Honors Society or a part of school plays, band, the Scholar Bowl or any non-sports activities          Cooke Maroney, far left, is seen in his 2001 High School yearbook from his junior year at Middlebury Union High School in Middlebury, Vermont. He was serving as a \u0027Junior Escort\u0027\u0027People thought \u0027who are these guys who are doing new things?\u0027 In no time, however, they won us guys over. They\u0027ve been very good to me. They\u0027re a great family.\u0027But the size of the undertaking eventually  caught up with the family.On one frigid night in February 1994, when Cooke was nine years old and his sister Annabelle just three, tragedy struck the budding farming operation. A fire,  likely started up by sparks in a utility closet, took out the farm\u0027s main barn.\u0027It lit up the area like it was daylight,\u0027 Jerome recalls. \u0027The barn was probably 200ft long and all in wood. There were more than 100 cows in there. It was some kind of a spark that started the fire, and before you know it, the whole thing was engulfed.\u0027Neighbors who saw the fire before the Maroneys, who were sleeping, rushed to the scene and managed to get most of the cows out, except for a few calves.Still, the milking business was finished. The Maroneys sold the surviving heifers and switched to renting their land out to area farmers either for grazing or making feed and hays.Over the past five years, they also started a $150-a-night down-home country bed-and-breakfast at their white wooden home while James maintained his art dealing gig.          He grew up on a 700-acre farm (pictured) in Leicester, Vermont, a one-store town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie that\u0027s holding a VW Beetle high above its head          Long before he began dating the Hollywood star, Maroney was a \u0027sensitive jock\u0027 who shunned the limelight - but was popular with the girls at Middlebury Union High School in Vermont          The  town outside Middlebury known for its 25ft concrete roadside gorilla named Queen Connie holding a VW Beetle high above its head\u0027The good thing is after they got here, everybody started doing organic,\u0027 Jerome said. \u0027But in this area, neighbors are far from one another so we stay out of everybody\u0027s business. I think the daughter comes home more often than Cooke. I haven\u0027t seen him in three or four years.\u0027When asked if he knew of Cooke\u0027s celebrity fiancee, Jerome replied:  \u0027Sorta. Is that who Cooke\u0027s with?\u0027 In Middlebury, where Cooke was bussed daily to attend school and play Tigers hockey, he didn\u0027t appear to be overly active.According to the yearbooks leading to his graduation in June 2002, he wasn\u0027t a member of the Honors Society or a part of school plays, the band, the Scholar Bowl or any non-sports activities.\u0027He did play hockey and maybe even lacrosse,\u0027 said business owner Burkholder. \u0027He was sorta a sensitive jock.\u0027And he did okay academically, even in French.          Burkholder added: \u0027He was never a big fan of being the center of attention. He\u0027ll definitely do well with a big time actress and support her from the background\u0027\u0027That\u0027s because he scrambled to copy my French notebook at the last minute before class,\u0027 said Burkholder. \u0027I let him, though.

Poland\u0027s eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) Party also belongs to the ECR. The liberal group could even - according to the survey - increase its representation to 93 seats if it is joined, whether formally or in an alliance, by French President Emmanuel Macron\u0027s Republic on the Move (LREM) party.LREM\u0027s expected gains will however come at the expense of established centrist parties, not Pen\u0027s National Rally (NR), which the poll average shows will strengthen its position and win 21 seats.The NR belongs to the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group, which could rise from 37 to 59 seats with help from Salvini\u0027s League, which is sceptical of Brussels but not outright opposed to Italy\u0027s EU membership.The League, which counts only six seats in the current parliament, are projected to win 27.Overall, eurosceptic and populist forces will represent more than a fifth of the new parliament if the ENF and ECR results are added to those of the EFD, which includes the League\u0027s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement.But these gains are comparable to their current representation.\u0027Contrary to what some have said, the extremes, the nationalists and the populists are far from attaining a majority,\u0027 analyst Christine Verger told AFP.\u0027Even if they increase a little in numbers, this will not fundamentally shake up the internal balance,\u0027 said the analyst from the Jacques Delors Institute.Gains by such groups in smaller EU countries have had little impact at the European level, she added.Corinna Horst of the German Marshall Fund think tank said she would not put \u0027too much weight\u0027 on polling results, especially this early.The issue, Horst said, is less about populist gains than about the fragmentation of the European Parliament and EU Council summits gathering leaders of the member countries.\u0027The bigger question is how the EU will govern amidst this fragmentation,\u0027 Horst said in an email to AFP.In one example, the EU is split over how to share responsibility for asylum seekers, which has fuelled the rise of populist parties in Italy and other countries.The EU remains deadlocked even though migrant arrivals have fallen sharply since a 2015 peak.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Turkish mother injected 18 month old baby bleach didnt love her","story":"    The young baby, Eylul Miray, was taken to the doctor by her father after she started bleeding from her ears and belly button.

He blames US sanctions and \u0027economic war\u0027 for Venezuela\u0027s crisis.Guaido, the 35-year-old leader of the Venezuelan legislature, has appealed to military leaders to switch allegiance to him and let the aid through.

JAN MOIR raises a glass of Tittinger to Del Boy and Rodney as Only Fools and Horses storms the West EndBy JAN MOIR FOR THE DAILY MAILChateauneuf du Pape! What is occurring here? On a busy Saturday night up West, a three-wheeled vehicle is illegally parked outside a London theatre. Fans swarm around the yellow Reliant Regal, posing for selfies and even kissing the bonnet.For despite its pantomime grime and battered bodywork, this little motor is as iconic as the Tardis, as famous as the Batmobile, more loved than Cinderella\u0027s pumpkin coach.     There are loud cheers when Del Boy appears in his sheepskin coat, setting up his stall with genuine models of the Leaning Eiffel Tower of Pisa. The year is 1989, and Del informs us that he still hasn\u0027t got a pot, how can I put this politely, to use as a receptacle for his body fluidsAnd we all know what its presence here means. It means Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad have finally made it to the West End.Only Fools And Horses The Musical opened in review at the Theatre Royal Haymarket at the weekend and already tickets for the show are rarer than genuine Rolexes on Del\u0027s fly pitch in Peckham market.In the two-hour show, comedy actor Paul Whitehouse plays Grandad, while Tom Bennett is Del Boy and Ryan Hutton takes the part of Rodney. All three sing and dance in a romp which includes 20 songs, amid scenes and running gags directly culled from writer John Sullivan\u0027s much-loved sitcom.Oddly enough, in one old episode of the telly series, Rodney ponders the notion of a musical about the Trotters. \u0027Then as a sequel, they could do Schindler\u0027s List on ice,\u0027 he concludes, surmising the improbability of such an idea.        John Sullivan\u0027s original scripts shimmered with genius, while his finely drawn characters could never be bettered and his bevelled plots stand the test of time. I mean, pot pourri! The good news is that the gang are all here, including Boycie and Marlene (Jeff Nicholson and Samantha Seagar), Raquel (Dianne Pilkington), Cassandra (Pippa Duffy), Trigger (Peter Baker), Denzil (Adrian Irvine), Mickey Pearce (Chris Keily) and special mention to Oscar Conlon-Morrey who is quite brilliant in his range of supporting roles.In a show that mixes up musical styles with hilarious gusto, the Driscoll brothers (Pete Gallagher and Adam Venus) pop up to sing a menacing ditty a la Gilbert \u0026amp Sullivan while Raquel emotes sadly of love in a way that Andrew Lloyd Webber would approve.For the leads, accuracy of impression seems to be more important than depth of musical skill, with only Bennett rising effortlessly to the challenge of both. He even makes Del tap dance! What a star.Still, Hutton absolutely nails down Nicholas Lyndhurst\u0027s Rodney, while Paul Whitehouse manages, from the depths of Grandad\u0027s stained armchair and a shirt that still has more food on it than a menu, to make the old boy both pathetic and heroic. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t mind a nice bit of haddock for my tea,\u0027 he says at one point, and it nearly made me cry.The bad news, if there is any, is that the show has little dramatic impetus. Instead, it is a compendium of classic Only Fools episodes and plotlines. The dialogue, like Del Boy\u0027s pre-blessed communion wine, has been imported wholesale from old shows. There is little new except a few songs, and some of those are a bit make-weight.There are moments when the jubbly is not as lovely as it could be and you can sense the audience yearning for something more. No doubt this will improve as the show gets into its stride.The plot, what there is of one, is similar to Dates, the episode in which Del meets Raquel. Along the way, Rodney marries Cassandra (from an episode called Little Problems) and later the gang all plan a day-trip to Margate (Jolly Boys Outing).Still, perhaps this was for the best. John Sullivan\u0027s original scripts shimmered with genius, while his finely drawn characters could never be bettered and his bevelled plots stand the test of time. I mean, pot pourri!Who could possibly top Del Boy\u0027s magnificent malapropisms and jambon-fisted grasp of languages? Sullivan died in 2011, but his son Jim has teamed up with Whitehouse to produce a script and score that honours his father\u0027s legacy, complete with musical contributions by Chas and Dave.The TV show won many awards during its 33-year run. Starting in 1981, there were seven series, 64 episodes and 16 seasonal specials, all starring David Jason as Del Boy and Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney. Lennard Pearce, who played Grandad, was replaced after his death in 1984 by Buster Merryfield as Uncle Albert.It holds the record for biggest TV sitcom audience, when Time On Our Hands attracted 24.3 million viewers at Christmas in 1996.Who is going to mess with that legacy? For if you laughed at the idea of Del Boy performing the \u0027Himmler\u0027 manoeuvre on Grandad after he ate an Odour Eater first time around, well you will howl again when it is replayed in the musical.

My parents are very liberal, but I still felt sick when, aged 25, I realised I had to tell them I was a lesbian: it felt like too much information, as though I was announcing I liked it from behind. This was just the last in a series of comings-out. When I was 12, my friends read my diary and realised I had a crush on another girl. Soon afterwards, an actual boy kissed me on the cheek at his bar mitzvah and everyone forgot about the girl. Aged 14, I told a few people I was gay, but then I developed a crush on Eddie Izzard and decided I was bisexual. Finding another woman to be bisexual with seemed like a lot of effort, though, so I pretty much forgot about fancying women until I was in my 20s.Coming out never happens just once. First you have to acknowledge your sexuality or gender identity to yourself. Then you might tell your friends and family, add a rainbow flag to your Twitter bio, ostentatiously read Sarah Waters novels on the train, that sort of thing. But it doesn’t end there. You’ll come out over and over again for the rest of your life – to the new guy at work who asks whether you’re married, to the family friend who assumes “partner” means “business associate”, and to the estate agent who thinks your wife is your daughter. (This has happened to me twice. Twice.)To me, being queer is an absolute gift, and that’s reflected in my novel, In at the Deep End. It tells the story of Julia, who comes out in her mid-20s and is thrilled when she realises that queer culture is her culture – Dusty Springfield, But I’m a Cheerleader, the colour pink, vegan food, all the best things – and throws herself into the life with gay abandon.Of course, the fight for LGBTQ equality is far from over, and being openly queer is a privilege that millions of people around the world don’t enjoy, but I wanted to celebrate the sheer joy of finding your community and figuring out who you are.Here, in no particular order, are 10 very good books about coming out.1. The Times I Knew I Was Gay by Eleanor CrewesIn this charming, funny comic, Crewes traces the moments she realised she might be gay, from her holy communion to her first date with a woman. She describes the “burst of life” she feels when she comes out once and for all – and the regret that it has taken her so long. 2. Tipping the Velvet by Sarah WatersWaters’ first novel, set in the 1890s, follows Nan King as she goes from naive Whistable oyster-girl to music-hall star to London rent boy to openly lesbian “tom”. Nan’s coming out is gradual: she falls for male impersonator Kitty Butler as soon as she sees her on stage, but quickly realises she has to keep her feelings to herself. By the end of the novel, though, she embraces her sexuality. She takes her lover’s hand in public, “and – careless of whether anybody watched or not – I leaned in and kissed her”.3. Moab Is My Washpot by Stephen FryWhen I was 17, I fell horribly in love with a girl I’d never spoken to. Then I read Fry’s description of falling in love in the same way, and I felt much less alone. I underlined the passage in pencil, the way teenagers do: “How can it be that just the gait of him, the stand of him, the shape and turn away of him, can be enough for me to know and to know at once?… I wrote it down that first afternoon. I love Matthew Osborne. I instinctively knew this meant that everything was changed.”4. Under the Udala Trees by Chinelo OkparantaThis debut novel tells the story of Ijeoma, who falls in love with another girl, Amina, during the Nigerian civil war. In Nigeria, anyone found guilty of having a same-sex relationship – or “supporting” a same-sex relationship – can be sentenced to 14 years in prison. In the northern states, the punishment is death by stoning. In her author’s note, Okparanta writes: “This novel attempts to give Nigeria’s marginalised LGBTQ citizens a more powerful voice, and a place in our nation’s history.”5. More Tales of the City by Armistead MaupinThis features one of the most iconic comings-out in queer literature: Michael Tolliver’s Letter to Mama. “If you and Papa are responsible for the way I am, then I thank you with all my heart, for it’s the light and joy of my life,” he writes. The fictional letter helped Maupin come out to his own parents – he knew they would read it and realise. Eventually he received a reply from his father: “Dear Teddy, As you know, your mother is very ill, so any additional stress can only exacerbate the situation.”6. Trans: A Memoir by Juliet JacquesThis book grew out of Jacques’  column, A Transgender Journey, which documented her gender reassignment. Juliet comes out again and again, as she navigates her identity and the evolving language around gender identities. Some of the most touching passages are about Juliet’s relationship with her mother. Shortly after her surgery, they go bra shopping together, and Juliet’s mum refers to her as “my daughter” in public. Jacques writes: “Now I could see that she understood my transition as a process in which far more had been gained than lost.”7. When Katie Met Cassidy by Camille PerriEverything I’ve ever wanted in a Hollywood romcom, in book form. One of the “leads” is a gender non-conforming lesbian and the other is a outdoorsy girl from Kentucky who has never even considered dating another woman. Of course, it’s Katie from Kentucky who comes out during the story. At first she’s embarrassed to be seen with another woman in public, but she overcomes her shame – and like all good lesbians, Katie and Cassidy declare their love for each other 10 days after meeting.8. Fun Home by Alison BechdelBechdel won a MacArthur “genius grant” for her pioneering graphic novel, which focuses on her difficult relationship with her father. Just four months after Alison came out as a lesbian – and her father admitted to having affairs with men – he killed himself. “With my father’s death following so hard on the heels of this doleful coming-out party,” she writes, “I could not help assume a cause-and-effect relationship.”9. Giovanni’s Room by James BaldwinBaldwin wrote this novel in the early 1950s, so it’s not surprising that it falls into the “being queer can lead to tragedy” category of LGBTQ fiction. David, the protagonist, doesn’t want to come out, to himself or anyone else. He proposes to his girlfriend, Hella, but then starts an affair with Giovanni, a young Italian waiter. At the end of the novel, when Hella discovers David with a sailor, he tells her: “I wasn’t lying to you … I was lying to myself.”10. Death in the Spotlight by Robin StevensThe seventh book in Stevens’ bestselling Murder Most Unladylike series, aimed at children aged 9-14. When an actress is murdered at a London theatre, amateur detectives Daisy and Hazel vow to find the culprit – but then Daisy falls for one of the suspects. The suspect happens to be a woman, and Daisy happens to be one of the best-loved characters in contemporary children’s literature. I am so glad this book exists: Daisy is a queer heroine children will look up to, and Hazel is a brilliant role model for young allies. When Daisy tells her she likes girls, Hazel says: “You’re my best friend and nothing you can do can change that.”• In at the Deep End by Kate Davies is published by HarperCollins, priced £12.99.

The watchdog outlined numerous concerns, saying the deal would harm competition in every local market for supermarket groceries where either are present, in every local market for online grocery shopping and in 132 local markets for fuel in which both supermarkets operate petrol stations.The CMA, led by the former Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, laid out limited options for addressing the concerns but said it was “likely to be difficult for the companies to address the concerns it has identified”.Options include blocking the deal altogether or “requiring the merging companies to sell off a significant number of stores and other assets – potentially including one of the Sainsbury’s or Asda brands – to recreate the competitive rivalry lost through the merger”.Analysts were sceptical that the merger could be reformulated sufficiently to allow it to be cleared. The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: “The deal looks to have suffered a mortal blow the CMA struggles to see how remedies can deliver its view of a competitive UK market.”Sainsbury’s and Asda said they would press ahead despite the CMA’s concerns. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, described the CMA’s analysis as “fundamentally flawed” and accused the regulator of rewriting the rules.“A UK plc with Brexit looming, and a completely unpredictable set of competition rules, who would invest in this country? This is just outrageous,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market … We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce0d73d699ab7085009e78a8175b1362be0c40d/0_60_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3716668534eba08f7cd4d8eeb8990e1","title":"no deal brexit wrecking economy trade","story":"The news from Honda that it will be closing its Swindon factory in 2022 with the loss of 3,500 jobs follows a warning by Airbus that it could slash investment in the UK, and an announcement by Nissan that it is abandoning its commitment to make the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. We all have to wake up to what’s happening in our country. Britain is losing billions every week because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of UK trade, investment is being shelved and businesses are shifting from Britain to the EU’s single market. Around £800bn of financial assets are being moved from the country ahead of Brexit.This economic drain will continue until investors and businesses know categorically what future relationship Britain will have with Europe. Theresa May’s deal does not set this out. The same is true for trade secretary Liam Fox’s abortive negotiating efforts: other countries won’t strike substantive trade deals until they know where Britain is going to end up with regard to Europe’s giant market. This is at the core of Britain’s current languishing state.A resolution of the uncertainty is urgently needed. But May is wrong in arguing that this can be achieved by agreeing to her deal because it purposely obscures the conditions under which businesses and investors will be operating in post-Brexit Britain.If we leave the EU at the end of March on her terms, the exact same argument will simply begin all over again on 1 April: whether we are going to be close to or distant from the EU, aligned or not with single market rules, in a customs union or not, assuming control of our policies or becoming an EU regulatory satellite, and whether we are going to have an independent trade policy or not. These issues go to the heart of the chasm that ides the Conservative party. But they are also the direct responsibility of Labour MPs.Clear answers to these questions – which are unaddressed in May’s deal – are essential for anyone doing business with or in the UK.This clarity will not be achieved by simply taking no deal off the table. Understandably, MPs are pursuing legislation, promoted by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and others, that would remove the option of crashing out of the EU because (even allowing for hyperbole) there is no doubt that market confidence would reel, the pound would fall further and every reach of the economy would face disruption. But avoiding no deal does not, in itself, offer answers to the fundamental Brexit questions. These have to be addressed before we leave, when we will lose what remains of our negotiating leverage.Nor will we be any further forward by adding words to the infamous Irish border backstop to make it less unpalatable to Tory MPs. May already knows that what the EU is offering will fall short of the Brextremists’ demands. She wants to bounce them at the last minute.What is blocking Tory unity is not in fact the backstop, but the realisation that the condition for both avoiding the hard border in Ireland and making good on the government’s promised free circulation of goods in Europe is to enter a customs union with the EU. This is the basis of the private guarantees that the government has given to Japanese and other international manufacturers and which these corporations no longer believe.The May “Chequers plan”, or anything like it, is only viable if Britain is within the EU’s existing trade policy structure, rather than some imagined version of it.As someone who negotiated within this structure, I know the EU is not going to rewrite its rulebook for Britain or create a fresh new bureaucracy to supervise May’s unicorn plan. It is also not going to allow Britain to have the benefits of access while allowing us to compete as we like. Instead, if we want frictionless trade in goods and maintenance of our supply chains, we will have to accept EU rules governing this trade, lock, stock and barrel. It will secure a large bulk of our trade but will be the opposite of taking back control.This is the crux of the choice investors are waiting for Britain to make – to operate within or outside the EU’s regulatory perimeter – and no amount of words, can-kicking and general pretence can disguise it.Unless it is resolved while MPs have the whip hand, we know that Brexiters in the cabinet will engineer the hardest of departures when parliament no longer has any power to affect the outcome. Michael Gove made this clear when, on the Today programme last month, the Brexiter environment secretary talked of the “stage one” exit door – afterwards, he said, “we can determine our future” and “organise our trade as we choose”.MPs, caught between their sense of obligation to honour the referendum and desire not to wreck the economy, face a dilemma. Personally, I would put the economy first, postpone exit and insist on a resolution of the choices before leaving. Otherwise, these choices are simply going to be handed over to a Brexiter-dominated Tory cabinet without any parliamentary constraint operating on them. Is this what Labour MPs really want?A compromise, after parliament has decided, would be for the British people to vote to give their final, informed consent. This would give legitimacy to the outcome and then the country could unite to make the best of the decision, whatever it is.Democracy did not end with the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016. And now millions of jobs and livelihoods depend on bringing real closure to an argument that is currently costing us the earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d42ba4a5aa3f9ed4f2cb3f8e0215681a52ff15/0_308_4854_2911/master/4854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9835b5f996778274482958ef95d923ea","title":"scheming politicians are captivating but politics is about more than a soap opera","story":"Policies may not be as interesting as personalities, but they matter more. Just ask the man behind the barI think we all agree that: “I’m not interested in politics,” is the most dispiriting thing you can hear someone say. What do you mean you don’t like politics? What do you mean you don’t vote? Don’t you understand that good people fought bad people so you would have the right to vote?Yet I wonder if politically engaged clever dicks like us, with our dinner-party wisdom, really have that much to boast about. After all, what do we really mean when we say we are “into politics”?What actually captivates us about politics is the drama of it all, the Shakespearean tragedy, history, comedy and farce. It’s the soap opera we love. It’s the stranger-than-fiction scheming and plotting of the actors on this stage, as they crawl over and under and through each other to get to the top or the bottom or wherever they end up. Once you have got to grips with the plots and subplots, got a handle on the characters, read newspapers like this one, listened to Laura Kuenssberg, skulked around on the websites and subscribed to the odd conspiracy theory, there is no boxed set more binge-worthy.But all this stuff has very little to do with making our country a better place. It is not about the discharge of power, but the acquisition of it.There ought to be a second word for politics, because there’s politics as in the fun stuff, and there’s politics as in the really important stuff: the big ideas and the detailed, messy, hard grind of making and enacting the policies that can change things. How many of us can honestly say we switch on the radio, or check websites, to get the latest updates on key policies?This came home to me just after the Brexit referendum, when I made the Panorama I keep banging on about, focusing on the (mainly leave) voters of the West Midlands. There was a great guy I’m still in touch with called Ryan Morris, then landlord of a delightfully named pub in Tividale called The Wonder. Ryan was passionate and knowledgable about politics. In the lead-up to the referendum, his pub had turned into an informal debating chamber, with him in the chair.I spent time with him and his clientele in the early part of that week’s filming, and then went back to see him on a most tumultuous day in politics. It was the day Gove knifed Johnson (or was it the other way round?). The Panorama crew and I were mesmerised I couldn’t wait to get Ryan’s take on it.I walked into The Wonder, all of a bluster, shouting: “What do you think? Have you seen it all?” He just shrugged. He genuinely couldn’t have cared less. And then the penny dropped and I felt rather ashamed: his interest in the whole thing was nobler than mine. His concern with Brexit was pure in that it was only about policy. It was about how he felt things might change for the better. Westminster intrigue intrigued nobody at all in The Wonder in Tividale.Obviously you can’t exercise power if you don’t acquire it in the first place. But how much more intellectual energy can be expended on that pursuit before there’s no energy left at all for anything else?I don’t know if this is what the Gang of Seven were on about this week when they said politics was broken, but if they are, they’re on to something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc926b12b1f0c74f8b1fce95bddcb46dc770309/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2969a6d69add0cbd0fc910d43df100b9","title":"im not spending money on that the rise of the teetotal student","story":"Universities are seeing an increase in teetotal clubs and alcohol-free accommodation. Why are students drinking less?Like most students heading off to university, Emily Proctor, 19, felt apprehensive. But it wasn’t just the thought of leaving her family and making new friends that caused her to be anxious Proctor was concerned about how she’d fit in as a teetotal student.“I was worried as I knew that much of university life involves going out drinking, especially in the first year,” explains Proctor, who is studying law at Swansea University. To help alleviate her concerns, she signed up for the university’s alcohol-free accommodation. “I didn’t want to be around people who were partying constantly and coming home drunk,” she says. “I wanted to be around similar people who I could chill with instead of going out every night.” Proctor, who doesn’t drink alcohol as it’s never appealed to her, says that decision has proven to be a wise choice. “It worked out well in the end as I have friends that I stay in with and we might play cards, or go to the cinema or out for meals.”Universities are keeping apace with this cultural shift. A growing number of institutions such as Swansea, St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen offer dedicated alcohol-free accommodation.Universities are trying to shake off the drinking culture that has been embedded within university life. Aberdeen University’s student association asks all of its societies and clubs to run at least one alcohol-free event during freshers week, while Bristol holds a number of alcohol-free events during welcome week and has increased the number of alcohol-free drinks available in its union bar.Changes in students’ drinking habits have driven the University of Hull to make a number of adjustments. “We know that many of our students drink less regularly than they did five to 10 years ago, and we have many students who do not drink for cultural or religious reasons,” says Osaro Otobo, president of Hull University union. “We have reduced our club nights from twice to just once a week.”Students are taking the matters into their own hands and establishing societies that don’t revolve around drinking. “Our socials involve meeting for a hot beverage and cake every Thursday,” says Maria Marr, 22, president of the Sober Socials Society at Newcastle University. “We started the society in 2017 with 20 members and have now more than doubled it to 57,” adds Marr, who is studying a master’s in professional translation for European languages. While not completely teetotal – she might have one glass of wine a month – she believes more students are emerging as non-drinkers. “People are realising that you don’t need to give into social pressure. Alcohol is one those things you’re supposed to do when you grow up but a lot of people don’t like the taste and think, ‘I’m not spending money on that.’”George Pitt, 19, a teetotal medicine student at the University of East Anglia, says that while there is undeniably a massive drinking culture at university, “alcohol is not the be-all and end-all of socialisation”. Pitt, who is a member of the UEA Societea, a club where drinkers and non-drinkers meet for tea, adds: “The reality is most people don’t care too much as long as you don’t lord yourself over them or try to change them, so it’s really easy.”For those staying off the booze at uni, Marr’s advice is to look for societies and events where there isn’t a big drinking culture and to be upfront about your habits. “Of course people will try to encourage you to drink. You will have to deal with that, but don’t feel bad for the fact you’re not doing the same as everyone else.”Proctor adds: “Sometimes it can be hard as quite a lot of people drink quite heavily, but I’ve still been able to meet friends through my accommodation, societies and my course. It’s definitely been easier than I thought.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8171891519bd6b8b2e45059745e7d6245ffc57d/0_410_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7b399543f261c2acbdb0c2d06b13b0f","title":"farmers lamb culling no deal brexit exports union","story":"National Farmers Union warns of crisis if sheep farmers cannot export meat after 29 MarchThe government should pay sheep farmers to prevent the mass slaughter of lambs if there is no Brexit deal, union leaders have said.Last year officials considered plans to cull animals that could not be sold but it is understood they are now considering monetary compensation instead.The National Farmers Union president, Minette Batters, questioned what would happen to British produce if no deal is agreed that allows goods to be accepted.“With 900 hours to go, it’s unacceptable for government to leave British businesses having to take this gamble,” she said.Nick von Westenholz, the director of EU and international trade at the NFU, said sheep farmers were particularly vulnerable because they rely heavily on exports to the EU that could be halted for months if the UK crashes out of the bloc on 29 March.The EU has said it could take up to six months to authorise imports from UK food producers. The NFU says this would be a de facto trade embargo, leaving sheep farmers with no option but to slaughter surplus animals.While one MP joked in a meeting with NFU officials about holding a mass “Brexit barbecue”, the NFU said farmers would face a stark choice: kill their flocks or continue feeding them.“If you had a surplus as a result of no deal, they would have to slaughter or feed them. It is possible we could have a ‘slaughter premium’ – a market top-up where the government would essentially be assisting the farmer,” Van Westenholz added.Batters said no deal would “decimate” farmers, forcing them to rely on other parts of the world where they would face high tariffs for exports.“In a few weeks, if there isn’t a deal with the EU, high export tariffs could effectively mean we have no market for four-and-a-half million lambs. A no-deal Brexit could decimate those farms up and down Britain, from our uplands to the Welsh mountains, to the rolling hills and the English lowlands,” she said.Sheep farmers in Wales said on Wednesday it was “imperative” that were not left on the hook for government negotiations. The Farmers Union of Wales had meetings last week with the Welsh government and the environment minister George Eustice to discuss the “dire impacts of a hard Brexit on the sheep industry”.The FUW’s director, Nick Fenwick, said: “Government actions – which have consistently ignored our warnings about ending up in precisely the situation we are now in – make it imperative that our industry be compensated.”He said he welcomed the fact Eustice and the Welsh government were “considering the need to negate such an extreme situation” where farmers would be left with unwanted sheep.On Tuesday, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, revealed that the government would apply tariffs to food imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, to provide “specific and robust protections” to farmers.He will also use quotas, possibly mirroring import levels, to guard against price shocks for consumers.Although nothing has been confirmed, industry insiders believe this could involve large quotas for tariff-free beef and cheddar cheese to protect the frictionless flow of meat from countries such as Ireland, one of the largest exporters of these two goods.White chicken meat from places such as Brazil and Thailand could also be given a zero tariff in the schedule expected to be published later this week because UK consumer demand for breast meat outstrips domestic supply.But in areas where British producers are vulnerable, for example with lamb, low quotas and high tariffs could be set to stop cheaper cuts flooding the market from countries such as New Zealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f727e2b4167e4a5eb2398cab59fdf9918bd2031d/0_188_2822_1693/master/2822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2526a90c98a22c8ba440a629aad309e1","title":"king karl 12 moments that made lagerfeld a legend","story":"The late designer spent 65 years at the top of fashion, but he was equally known for his put-downs, his personal style and even his petsKarl Lagerfeld moved to Paris from his native Hamburg as a teenager and, although he had no formal fashion or art school education, soon made his mark. At the second Woolmark prize, in 1954, he won the best coat category at the age of 21. While this achievement showed Lagerfeld’s precocious talent, his rival – Yves Saint Laurent – was already on the scene, winning best dress design at just 18. Throughout their lives, the two men were great friends and rivals in both work and love. Saint Laurent was the subject of one of Lagerfeld’s famous put-downs. “He is very middle-of-the-road French, very pied-noir, very provincial,” he said in 1984.Lagerfeld spent an astonishing, world-record-breaking 54 years at Italian house Fendi, producing more than 100 collections for it. This is a lifetime in an industry where designers, like football managers, are ditched after only months in charge. The young designer was, at the time, a freelancer working for Krizia and Charles Jourdan. The Fendi sisters hired him to bring some youth to the fur-centric Italian brand and he delivered, with tufted, dyed and shaved fur coats, the opposite of the grown-up floorlength minks seen at the time. In the process – and over the decades – he became enemy No 1 of animal rights groups. Peta’s UK director Mimi Bekhechi called him “an undertaker”. Silvia Venturini Fendi, meanwhile, described him as “my mentor and my point of reference.”By the 70s, Lagerfeld was part of the Le Sept set, a group of Parisian bohemians for whom work and life – and often night and day – were happily blurred at the tiny Parisian nightclub. The designer was friends with Saint Laurent, the model Donna Jordan and the illustrator Antonio Lopez, and he met his lover of 18 years, Jacques de Bascher, about this time. Warhol, who could sniff out a glamorous set across oceans, immortalised Lagerfeld and friends in his film L’Amour. Some of it was filmed in Lagerfeld’s apartment, where the drama unfolds. Lagerfeld played a version of himself and french-kisses with Jordan at one point.Lagerfeld joined Chanel on a part-time basis in 1983, continuing to design for Chloe, Fendi and others. It was, however, his work for Chanel over 36 years that made him famous. His first show didn’t wow the critics and was notable for its concentration on 20s silhouettes rather than the pastel skirt suits Chanel was known for. Women’s Wear Daily wrote that Lagerfeld “committed too many Chanel Dont’s and not enough Do’s” in the collection. Over the next decades, the designer proved the critics wrong, as he reinvented the brand’s double Cs, tweed and pearls time and time again. “The good thing about Chanel is it is an idea you can adapt to many things,” he said.“Fashion is about today,” said Lagerfeld in a 2007 New Yorker profile. The designer arguably owed his longevity to his ability to tap into the zeitgeist way beyond clothes. His collections have referenced everything from climate change to Amy Winehouse and modern feminism. This show is an early example of pop culture on Lagerfeld’s Chanel catwalk. It featured the supermodels Kate Moss, Carla Bruni and Naomi Campbell in bucket hats, baggy trousers and denim. One model wore overalls and roller-skates. It was a long way from Chanel pre-Lagerfeld, something the designer said was only worn by “Parisian doctors’ wives”.Lagerfeld was one of the most recognisable fashion designers in the world – thanks to his uniform of black suit, white shirt, fingerless gloves, pompadour and sunglasses. This look came together in the noughties, combined with drastic weight loss. “I suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,” he said, referring to the Dior Homme designer whose suiting is notoriously made in tiny sizes. Lagerfeld stuck to his diet – no sugar, cheese or bread, around 10 cans of Diet Coke a day – continuously, with no temptation. “I’m like the animals in the forest,” he said. “They don’t touch what they cannot eat.”In 2004, the idea of a designer collaboration with a high-street brand – now commonplace – was a new concept. Lagerfeld – forever the multitasker – became the first designer to collaborate with H\u0026ampM in its now yearly collection. Taking inspiration from his own monochrome look, he also appeared in the advertising campaign with models. The collection was a great success, selling out within minutes. This was a one-off, however. Lagerfeld criticised the limited quantities of the items produced by the brand. “It is snobbery created by anti-snobbery,” he said. His response wasn’t entirely inclusive, however a newly svelte Lagerfeld was also displeased that the chain had produced the collection in larger sizes.Western brands began to court Asian consumers in the noughties and Lagerfeld was ahead of the curve. He brought the Fendi show to the Great Wall of China in 2007, at a cost of more than $10m (£8.8m) and a year’s planning. It featured 88 looks – a number associated with prosperity in China – lots of red (for luck) and Chinese models. Asked where the brand’s show could go next, Silvia Fendi responded: “Maybe the moon.” You get the feeling Lagerfeld would have loved that idea.There can’t be many cats that boast a personal maid, travel by private jet, have their own book, an Instagram account, a Wikipedia page and a product line of their likeness. But Choupette is a special kind of feline. Given to Lagerfeld by the model Baptiste Giabiconi – who initially had Lagerfeld cat-sit Choupette while he was on holiday – she turned the designer into an alpha cat person. Lagerfeld told Numero magazine that Choupette stole his heart because “she is pretty to look at and has good poise, but her main quality is that she doesn’t talk”. In 2013, he proclaimed he would marry the cat if it was legal. Who will take over her care is as yet unknown.As his career developed, Lagerfeld’s reputation for put-downs grew, too. Stella McCartney’s appointment at Chloé prompted the industry-famous comment: “I think they should have taken a big name. They did - but in music, not fashion.” Pippa Middleton, Hedi Klum and Lana Del Rey were all subjects of his criticism. Later, body size became a focus. Asked of his opinion of Adele in 2012, he said: “She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a ine voice,” prompting an uproar online. Lagerfeld became so famous for his barbs that a book of his quotes was published in 2013.By the 2010s, Chanel’s fashion shows (of which there are a staggering seven annually) were known not just for clothes but for jaw-dropping sets. Taking the idea of experiential to the extreme, they somehow melded an art installation with a Disney-style theme park. These chimed perfectly with the social media age, when influencers attending fashion shows wanted way more than a snap of a model on the catwalk. Lagerfeld delivered – the Chanel supermarket, complete with double-C rubber gloves, cornflakes and cleaning products, is now the stuff of legend in fashion. It was only beaten by the Chanel rocket, three years later, which came with its own emoji.German-born Lagerfeld spent most of his adult life in Paris, designing for the Frenchest of French brands. It could be said that his outsider view was his great strength – allowing him to use the tropes of French chic, from Breton stripes to the brasserie, without self-consciousness. Appropriately, he was awarded the Grand Vermeil, Paris’ highest honour, after a haute couture show that featured a 38-metre-high replica of the Eiffel Tower on the catwalk. Presenting the medal to Lagerfeld, mayor Anne Hidalgo said: “Paris loves you – you are Paris.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9dbaa9dba45b5c5eb8548ce9a09d9c9535e08c2/0_0_3714_2228/master/3714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78375d4bca4510ae47f9eff8bf3b8394","title":"karl lagerfeld the chanel years in pictures","story":"The designer joined the fashion house in 1983, and remained for 36 years.

Did the job with such wit, memorably calling Oscar “the only 74-year-old man in Hollywood who doesn’t need Viagra to last three hours”, she was invited back three more times.The veteran comic film star deserved an Oscar himself for his record 19 hosting stints. And he sort of got one when the Academy awarded him a medal for his service to the show.Sally’s Harry hosted nine times, second only to Bob Hope and rebooted the gig by introducing the now familiar nominee songs, film parodies and montage videos.“Hosting the Oscars is like making love to a beautiful woman. It’s something I only get to do when Billy Crystal’s out of town.” Sharing the job with Alec Baldwin in 2010 was less successful but, in his two solo stints, Martin was hilariously irreverent. Even the crew adored him, calling him the “most low-maintenance host ever”.She not only had pizzas delivered to peckish audience members (collecting the money in Pharrell Williams’s hat) but staged an A-lister group selfie that went viral.“Welcome to two hours of sparkling entertainment spread out over a four-hour show… I see lots of new faces, especially on the old faces.” TV’s talkshow king hosted five times and was hailed as “the gold standard” by the LA Times.The usual standups were replaced by a song-and-dance man – and Wolverine pulled it off with infectious enthusiasm.

There are these great, great stories. These great historic events. I’m not talking about 1850s stuff. They don’t know who Malcolm X is. They don’t know who JFK is. They don’t know Muhammad Ali or Jackie Robinson. You can go down the line. It’s scary.”You could interpret Lee’s career, in part, as an exercise in filling those holes in America’s collective memory. Malcolm X is probably the most famous example, with his 1992 film reigniting a debate about the black political leader and his legacy. His documentary 4 Little Girls told the story of the Birmingham church bombing with its eerie parallels to the Charleston church shooting. But even She Hate Me – ostensibly an ethically questionable film about sperm donation – had a section dedicated to the story of Frank Wills, the security guard who raised the alarm about the Watergate break-in, struggled to find work after (he believed he was blacklisted) and who died in extreme poverty in 2000 at the age of 52.BlacKkKlansman fits into that continuum with its true-ish interpretation of Ron Stallworth’s time as an undercover cop – and its potent mix of historical fact and fiction, style, swagger and unpicking of current political ideology means its the obvious choice for this year’s best picture Oscar. Lee took inspiration from The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico, and for a director whose greatest work has never been acknowledged by the Academy, there would be something fitting in him finally getting recognition for a work that is simultaneously iconoclastic, more racially charged than ever and rooted in the very best of 70s cinema.Yes, Boots Riley has a valid point that the true story of Ron Stallworth was very different to the one that Lee presents. But the counter argument is that a film which is presented as being “based upon some fo’ real, fo’ real shit” should be taken with a healthy pinch of salt. And, anyway, the film’s best moments all mix reality and fiction to glorious effect. There’s Lee’s presentation of civil rights activist Kwame Ture, who Stallworth really did meet and who is played by a career-best Corey Hawkins. There’s the masterstroke of using Harry Belafonte to appear as Jerome Turner, a made-up character who tells the Colorado students about the very real lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas, is one of Lee’s very best and is an important piece of storytelling that lingers long after the credits roll. Then there’s the film’s coup de theatre: the interspersing of real-life footage of the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally, a joyous David Duke and Donald Trump’s conflation of anti-fascist protests with the far right groups that swamped the town.The sombre takeaway is that amid this often laugh-out-loud comedy is a reminder that the war against the far right hasn’t been won. As incompetent and ridiculous as the Klan and Duke are in BlacKkKlansman, the ideas they espouse are now – at least in part – influencing the leader of the free world and his inner circle. It is a vindication of Lee, whose constant drum-beat warnings about America’s racist inclinations were critiqued as outmoded under Obama, but now now sound like a sobering case of I Told You So.“The way he fused politics and sports, very few black athletes have talked the way Muhammad Ali talked, without fear of something happening to their career,” says Lee in When We Were Kings, issuing a statement that could be applied to the fragility of his own career in a Hollywood that hasn’t always appreciated him. “These kids today will be missing a whole lot if they don’t know about the legacy of Muhammad Ali. Because no matter what era you live in you see very few true heroes.”The Academy would be missing out if they failed to acknowledge the Brooklyn director yet again. He’s not only delivered a timely lesson in how history repeats, but he’s also shown why he’s one of the few true cinematic heroes operating today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

He had made a rapid impact after arriving from Fiorentina as a 19-year-old in 2012 but, two and a half years on, had fallen off Manuel Pellegrini’s radar with no obvious explanation bar some niggling injuries he had long since overcome.“I was thinking a lot: ‘What is the problem?’” he says. “After some time I spoke with Pellegrini and he explained I had to wait for my chance. In the end there were not so many opportunities to play. There was no issue between us but I couldn’t understand why it was like that and told him that I felt I could help the team more, that I should have more playing time at that moment and that, if it was not possible at City, then it would be better for everybody that I changed club.”Nastasic now has a chance to show City what could have been and, while it is hard to make a case they have missed him given the strides made under Pep Guardiola, a fair assessment is that he would not look out of place in today’s squad. Instead he will play for Schalke against his old employers at the Veltins Arena he is 25 and well established as one of Europe’s most reliable all-round central defenders.“To be honest I didn’t want this tie at first,” he says, recalling how his teammates’ eyes turned to him as they watched the last-16 draw here, at Schalke’s training ground. “Everybody knows how strong City are. But on the other hand I was happy I’d be going back to see some old faces. It will be an honour to play there again.”When Nastasic joined City he hardly spoke English and had to rely on his fellow Serb Aleksandar Kolarov and the Bosnian Edin Dzeko for help early on. On the pitch he adapted with ease. A debut at the Bernabéu, anchoring the defence alongside Vincent Kompany, was the first of 30 appearances in 2012-13 and, while the season ended with an FA Cup final defeat by Wigan, few of his peers emerged with their reputations similarly burnished.“The first season in Manchester was great,” he says. “I’d felt ready to go there and make the step, because maybe in life you have only one opportunity like this. When I arrived I felt everyone’s support and it was as if I’d been there for a couple of years already. I played almost every game, I was fit all the time, so it was good.”He still cherishes the influence of Kompany. “I learned a lot from him. He is such a professional and a great man who talks a lot with the players, especially the young ones. It was very important to play alongside him I’m really happy to see he’s still there because he’s a legend, really. In the dressing room he kept the atmosphere at the highest possible level.”It was a fine education and Nastasic also benefited from living in the same neighbourhood as Nemanja Vidic, another compatriot and childhood idol – “the type of player I wanted to be one day” – who gave his time generously in those early days.Nastasic had blossomed under Roberto Mancini’s management but life with Pellegrini was different. Knee and calf injuries disrupted the title-winning 2013-14 season and errors crept in. He missed its final three months and there was no way back to the extent that Pellegrini, listing his centre-backs in October 2014, failed to name Nastasic until prompted by a journalist.“It was a little shock for me,” he says. “You get one injury and after that you aren’t playing that much. I was young, and at that age you think: ‘I have to play all the time’ and all these things. When I look back now it was not easy for the coach we had a lot of good players, as every big team does. Things were up and down but I was really happy we won the title and that I can say I was part of it.”The admission of youthful impetuosity should not be confused with self-reproach about leaving for Schalke, who he joined – initially on loan – early in 2015 after being impressed by their then manager, Roberto Di Matteo. Another 18 months would pass before Guardiola’s arrival at City but, in a parallel timeline, would he have liked to try his luck under the Catalan?“Yeah, when I see how they play now and the style of football – a lot of dynamic pressing and possession – I think every player would like to play under a coach like him. It’s really unbelievable to see and I can’t imagine how it is to train every day and do things like that. But I spoke to Kolarov and he told me that he’s the best coach he had. Kolarov has had a lot of coaches so if he says it, that’s how it is.”Pretenders to Guardiola’s crown are emerging and among them is Domenico Tedesco, the gifted 33-year-old whom Nastasic believes has transformed him at Schalke. “I think I especially improved in the last two seasons under Tedesco,” he says. “He’s a great man for this club, really unbelievable on tactical things. His type of work is with a lot of aggression, a lot of tactics and, the most important thing for me, a lot of talk with the players.”Perhaps a little more of that from Pellegrini would have benefited Nastasic at City. But he is a pillar of Schalke’s dressing room now, and those with an ear to the inside say he is an intelligent, increasingly influential voice in a squad that finished second in last season’s Bundesliga but lost a leader upon the summer departure of Leon Goretzka for Bayern Munich.“I think everybody thinks it will be an easy game for City,” he says. “But that’s no problem for us, we don’t feel pressure. We have a good opportunity to see where we are and show that we can fight and play good football against one of the best teams in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9939708277d9b83c5c9c48e5001570aea336b0ee/545_980_4127_2476/master/4127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=082d1c133da500af26cdf60b910ea37c","title":"what is the longest gap between two fixtures of the same football teams the knowledge","story":"Plus: sent off after scoring a hat-trick, outscoring your age in a season and putting a corner flag to different use. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“When Newport played Manchester City in the FA Cup, it was the first time that the fixture had been played for more than 56 years,” writes Mark Meadowcroft. “The last match, on 24 October 1962 (2-1 to City at Maine Road in the League Cup) was at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the week after Love Me Do first charted. Is there a longer gap between two meetings of the same opponents?”Yes there is, Mark. Our first suggestion comes from Simon Cook: “Arsenal played Brentford on 26 September 2018 in the League Cup, 71 years after their last meeting on 26 May 1947.”But that can be topped. “As the oldest club in England still playing, Notts County have seen some opponents very infrequently,” writes Alex Lyon. “A quick look shows the longest gap between two matches is 109 years, with Kettering Town the opponents – the clubs have twice been drawn together in the FA Cup. The first match on 28 January 1899 was won by Notts County, but when they met again on 30 November 2008, the match was a draw and Kettering won the replay.”But that can be topped. “Even if you doubled Newport v City it wouldn’t beat the gap between fixtures for Chorley and Stockport County,” declared Gary Fairclough. “Before Stockport’s 3-0 league defeat to Chorley in November 2014 the two sides had not played each other competitively for 114 years. Their last meeting was in 1900 Britain was in turmoil over the second Boer War and across Europe new football teams were taking their first steps in the game with strange names like Ajax, Lazio and Bayern Munich. They probably never amounted to much.”But that can be topped. Here’s Michael Knaggs: “My best guess is on 24 August 2016, Accrington beat Burnley 1-0 in the EFL Cup. It was their first competitive meeting since 1893, 123 years prior, when Victoria had eight years to go as Queen of the empire, Dvorák’s New World Symphony premièred and Arthur Conan Doyle revealed that Sherlock Homes had died. If anyone can beat that, I tip my hat to them.”“Players who have scored a hat-trick and got sent off during the same match,” tweets Chris Bull, straight to the point.“Chris Iwelumo,” replies James Flynn, pithily, in reference to the 2008 game in which the big man was one of two Wolves players dismissed in a spicy 3-1 win over Preston. But before being sent off (for sticking his nut on Sean St Ledger), Iwelumo bagged a treble to take his tally that season to eight goals in seven games.“In the 2001-02 Primeira Liga,” offers Dirk Maas, “FC Porto’s Benni McCarthy completed his hat-trick in the 74th minute against Santa Clara, only to be red-carded six minutes later.”And an example we dug out from close to home.“Scott Dobbie of Queen of the South, age 36, had scored 37 goals by the end of January this season,” explains David Forbes. “Who is the oldest player to have outscored their age in a season?”“At top level, the legendary Ferenc Puskás takes some beating,” reckons David Warriston. “By the end of 1961-62, the Magyar maestro was 35 and had scored 40 goals for Real Madrid, including a first-half hat-trick in that year’s European Cup final. He was clearly on the slide however the following season he failed to beat his age, netting a meagre 31 goals.”Here’s more from Tim Dockery: “Even at 39, Patrizia Panico was inducing panic among her opponents. When the 2013-14 season ended in Women’s Serie A, she was the top scorer with 43 goals for Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Torres Calcio Femminile. During that time, she also scored four goals for Torres in cup competitions, bringing her total for the year to 47.”Room for one more. “Lee Trundle scored 45 league goals in 23 appearances for Llanelli Town in 2016-17, when he turned 40,” notes Dave Johnston. “He scored 53 in all competitions that season, in only 31 appearances. Llanelli Town were promoted to the Welsh Football League Division One.”“Have any players ever used a corner flag, a goalpost or an advertising hoarding to attack an opponent?” asked Pedro Salinas in 2007.Step forward Canada’s Paul Peschisolido, duly picking up a red card for his troubles against El Salvador during a World Cup qualifier in 1997. “I was kicked a few times and the referee wasn’t giving anything, while every challenge we made seemed to result in a foul,” he explained. “I was getting very annoyed and frustrated so I decided to elbow one of their players. It was right in the corner and, in fact, I elbowed the corner flag into his face.”Martin Keown managed the next best thing in January 2002, chucking a corner flag into the stands during Arsenal’s 1-1 draw at Elland Road. Early in the game Keown conceded a corner as he got up he grabbed the flag and casually lobbed it behind him into the front rows of fans. Despite uproar from the supporters, the FA eventually decided he had not intended to hit them, and did not enforce any punishment.Sadly there were no such exciting tales regarding advertising hoardings, though Rudy Hulsman was quick to remind us of the match between Orlando Pirates and Black Leopards in South Africa’s Premier Soccer League. With the game in mid-flow, heavy winds suddenly sent a number of hoardings flying across the pitch, taking out a linesman and several players in a matter of seconds.• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“New Celtic loan signing Timothy Weah (son of George) was recently called up to the USMNT, likewise Jonathan Klinsmann (son of Jürgen), Shaq Moore (son of Trinidad and Tobago international Wendell), and Fafa Picault (grandson of Haiti international Max Antoine),” writes Eddie Eyers. “Is this the greatest collection of national team players whose forebears played for other nations?”“Maty Ryan claims that the penalty he gave away in Brighton’s match against Burnley was the first he’s ever given away.

Some were given refunds on the day by the organisers, Exciting Events, but the festival’s Facebook page has disappeared.An estimated 2,800 people turned up at Norfolk showground near Norwich but there was only space for four children to practise archery at the same time and one climbing wall tower, which could accommodate three climbers.A spokesperson for Epic Games said: “The quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us, whether it’s inside the game or at official public events like last year’s Fortnite Pro-Am. Epic Games was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich and we’ve issued a claim against the organisers in the high court of London.”Fortnite is a “battle royale” free online game that allows up to 100 characters to fight for survival on a dystopian island. In November, it was reported to be the world’s biggest video game, with 200 million registered users worldwide.Despite the event’s poor reception, Shaun Lord, the owner of Exciting Games, suggested it would bring the festival back next year.On Sunday, Lord said eight of his 19 staff had not turned up on Saturday, leading to problems with queues. He said he had given a refund to everyone who had asked but refused to say how many people had claimed one. “We are dealing with people on an inidual basis,” he said.“There are a lot of people who have told me they have had a fantastic time and their kids have thoroughly enjoyed it. We will take everybody’s feedback into consideration and we will act on it.”Since its release in 2017, the popularity of Fortnite has exploded.

Johanna Payton, founder of no-fly travel site Feet on the Ground, explains whySerenity is elusive in today’s fast-paced world. A moment of complete calm and contemplation seems to be a rare and wonderful find. For me, those precious moments occur on a boat. Out on the waves, the horizon undisturbed, with a seemingly infinite stretch of sea before me. As legendary sailor Vito Dumas once said: “It’s out there at sea that you are really yourself.” On deck, enjoying awe-inspiring views, the cares of everyday life blown away on the sea breeze, you can appreciate his point.For me, there is no better way to travel than by sea. Flying is my nemesis. From airport chaos to the confined space of an aircraft, nothing about commercial aviation appeals to my sense of adventure – or comfort. I’ve spent too many hours stuffed in sardine cans at 30,000ft, hurtling high over oceans instead of enjoying them. It doesn’t help that I’m a fearful flyer many long-haul holidays have been tainted by the white-knuckle flights either side.Favouring boat travel isn’t just about managing aviophobia, though. Whether I’m on a short ferry crossing or a cruise, the sea provides a true sense of travel, from the impressive physical shift of a ship leaving port to its sturdy navigation of the open water. As a travel writer who hates flying, boat crossings make my leisure time and my work a pleasure. Every journey stirs my instinct and emotion. “We are tied to the ocean,” John F Kennedy said. As my ship steers towards an exciting new destination, I feel that affinity.And I’m not alone. “The journey is part of the holiday,” says travel writer and author Helen Ochyra. “I’ll stand out on deck, whatever the weather, and watch the ropes being untied, the boat slipping away from the dock and the landscape drifting farther and farther away.“Ferry travel doesn’t feel like a journey that has to be made, it feels like one you want to make. On a recent trip my husband and I left the mainland just before sunset and, standing on deck, we watched the sky turn orange and a pod of porpoises playing in the loch. I’ve spotted whales breaching, watched gannets risk their necks ing for fish and seen some of the best sunsets I can remember – all on ferries.”Tom Bourlet, founder of the Spaghetti Traveller blog, agrees: “On a plane, it’s difficult to make out much more than grassland on the ferry, there is something exhilarating about seeing land slowly getting closer.”He kicked off his ferry habit en route to the Isle of Man: “I booked the ferry because airports always feel stressful. From sitting in an overpriced airport to waiting on cramped planes, travel seemed like a nuisance. I love embracing new cultures and seeing amazing sights, but can’t stand plane journeys. Since I began taking ferries, this experience has drastically changed. On my first visit to the Isle of Man, I managed to catch the sunset and, beer in hand, felt pretty chuffed with my choice of ferry over plane.”For Cathy Winston, travel editor and writer of award-winning family travel blog MummyTravels, it’s about the sense of adventure. “Even on a fairly simple journey from A to B,” she says, “the wide, open sea makes it feel like you could be off to discover new lands. There’s a certain romance you don’t get on a plane or sat on a motorway.”Winston also values the family-friendly aspects of sea travel. “There’s something so relaxing about being on the water, especially with kids,” she says. “You can drive a car straight on to a ferry, so there’s no hanging around in airports, or trying to cram everything you need into one bag. On longer journeys, you can sit down and have a proper meal, or bring your own, which takes away another stress. Wandering around onboard during the journey is good for easily bored small people, heading out on deck to look for land and boats – and sharks, pirates, or anything else that takes their fancy.”Whether it’s for kid-happy convenience or sheer romance, boats will always be the preferred mode of transport for many travellers. Nina Simone once said: “My first love is the sea and water, not music.”Yes, a boat gets me where I want to go, avoiding the hassle – and terror – of air travel, but out on the waves, as reality melts away, I always rediscover my own primeval passion for the sea.From being able to bring your car, bike or four-legged friend with you to the lack of luggage fees, there are plenty of reasons to favour ferry travel for your next trip. Drive (or stroll) on to one of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferries, enjoy sea views, onboard facilities such as lounges, restaurants and shops, and you could drive straight off at Manx capital Douglas in under three hours. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin – there are some great offers available this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2feb92ab9ff735ad9360fbf87b1676a0dfb9d71/0_96_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeea6392b48bae23cd7f3ce9370d616f","title":"the great seascape castles kippers and coastal walks on the isle of man","story":"From history and hiking to hairpin bends, Mark Hillsdon and his partner take a tour of the Isle of Man’s cultural attractions, with time to spare for some classic Manx cuisineSetting off from Liverpool, we leave the calm morning waters of the Mersey estuary behind and head out across the Irish Sea. Having taken in the views from the deck of the iconic Isle of Man Steam Packet Company ferry, it’s time to settle down to breakfast and in less than three hours we’re moored up in Douglas – the Isle of Man’s capital – with a crescent-shaped bay backed by an impressive sweep of guesthouses, hotels and apartments.The trip across the island to the harbour city of Peel involves navigating the twisting roads that make up the famous TT racing circuit. Parts of this journey feel like you’re driving through a giant Scalextric set: roadside grandstands rise on either side of you, while dormant television gantries occupy strategic spots for cameras along the road.Peel is the centre of the Manx fishing industry, and it’s an ideal spot for an afternoon exploring the atmospheric labyrinth of narrow streets, picture-perfect fishermen’s cottages and treasure-trove antique shops. A visit to the House of Manannan, a museum named after the Celtic sea god, helps bring the island’s maritime heritage to life. As the afternoon fades, we head to the city’s impressive castle, which sits proudly on the cliff edge of St Patrick’s Isle, to take in the stunning sight that gives Peel its local nickname: Sunset City.Then it’s off to Baie Mooar, a guesthouse in Ramsey, on the north-east of the island, run by Jen and her husband Simon (a classically trained chef, whose traditional Manx kippers are smoky perfection). Spacious, airy and beautifully presented, it’s a cut above the traditional B\u0026ampB, and the view across the bay from our huge double room is breathtaking.Our busy day two begins in Laxey, home to perhaps the island’s most famous landmark, the Lady Isabella. Now the largest working waterwheel in the world, this feat of Victorian engineering, still resplendent in its red, white and black livery, was built to pump water from the surrounding lead, copper and zinc mines. It’s worth taking on the vertiginous spiral staircase for the views out across the Laxey valley.After a quick cuppa at JJ Ribbons, a quaint haberdashery that doubles as a cafe, we opt for a trip up Snaefell (snow mountain), the highest peak on the island. The mountain railway opened in 1895 and still relies on many of the original wooden carriages, with their slatted seats and varnished interiors. Despite their age, the trains are at home on the steep, winding track, which takes you to the summit where – on a clear day – you can see England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. There are a number of possible walking routes back down, but we choose to take the swift ride back and spend the rest of the day exploring the island’s quiet lanes and historical sites.The next stop is to see the elaborate carved Norse crosses at Ballaugh and Andreas, before heading south to Tynwald Hill, the ancient meeting place of the oldest parliament in the world. At the Braaid site you can walk in the footsteps of ancient ancestors, and explore the remains of an iron-age roundhouse and Norse longhouse.Our day ends at the Abbey restaurant, set in the shadow of the 12th-century Rushen Abbey amid fantastic gardens dotted with ancient trees. It prides itself on a seasonal, ever-changing menu, making the most of the island’s fantastic supply of seafood.On Sunday we rise early to walk part of the Raad ny Foillan, the 95-mile “Way of the Gull” coastal path around the island, hugging a coastline that rivals the seascapes of Cornwall. Niarbyl Bay is deemed one of the most stunning spots on the island, with its thatched cottage, rock pools and lobster pots piled high, while a short walk along the coastal path leads to an unspoiled sandy cove.We have a brew at the Niarbyl Bay Cafe, where the car park doubles as one of the island’s many dark sky sites, spots so devoid of light pollution that on a clear night the heavens are dazzling. Then it’s off on a whistle-stop tour of Castletown, the island’s former capital, where the imposing Castle Rushen – a medieval citadel that was once besieged by Robert the Bruce – looks down over the harbour, all looming parapets and crenellated ramparts.Having dragged ourselves away in time to catch the return ferry, we crowd on to the aft deck to try and see a minke whale that was spotted off the coast earlier that day, the port of Douglas slowly vanishing in our wake.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash. This circular stone-and-glass cafe was designed to take full advantage of the glorious views of the sunsets and the seals that bob amid the rocks below. We watch in wonder, feasting on local seafood such as Manx queen scallops cooked with bacon, garlic and lashings of butter.Other favourite eateries during our stay include Ballacregga Corn Mill tearooms – beside the island’s iconic Great Laxey Wheel, the largest working waterwheel in the world – where scallops come as part of a ine fish chowder, and the Creek Inn on the quayside at Peel.Heading back to the ferry at Douglas we also discover hip North Quay, where we have a last treat of piri-piri chicken and milkshakes at the Barbary Coast Grill \u0026amp Bar and stock up on fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread at Noa Bakehouse. Pulling out of port, kids little and large agree that we’ve hardly scratched the surface of this high-octane island, and that it will be only a matter of time before we’re back onboard the boat to Douglas.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

I suspect this will prove to be a bad miscalculation by Umunna et al. The ‘future of British politics’ will be one without them - which is a shame because I’d much prefer we united all of our efforts into getting rid of the vile government. Mike BarkerThe only thing that would be useful - to the country, if not the leadership of the two main parties - about Umunna et al going would be that they take a few Tories with them, and thus remove May’s majority. Theoretically at least, this could really change the direction of British politics and force a second referendum, or the abandonment of no-deal or of Brexit altogether. But if they can’t do that, this is just a waste of time and column inches. And I can’t help wondering exactly what it is that Chris Leslie sees in the company he’s keeping ... unless it can tempt away half a dozen Tories to go with them. wightpaintFinally! A centrist party that remain voters can get behind! So sick of Tory and Labour spearheading Brexit meaning no effective opposition. Let’s get real proportional representation and sort this country out in coalitions representing this ided country’s views - the only way we’re going forward together as a country is in compromise and the two-party system prevents this. Tallisker2Pretty damning. These seven will get a lot of stick rightfully so I believe, but still pretty damning for Corbyn and most sickening of all, the Tories will get a pass on the Brexit mess because of disunity like this. Not sure how these seven don’t see that, or maybe they don’t care? There probably is space for a new centrist party, but we’re facing the biggest issue in generations which needs addressing. Now wasn’t the time for this, and for timing alone these seven should be case into the wilderness of British Politics for ever. Rob BrackstoneThe “New” Labour people have no real perspective on how history will view their actions. The timing of the 172 MPs who voted to out Corbyn just after the referendum and probably cost Labour the 2017 GE and now, it looks like they are jumping ship just when we need as much effort as possible behind a people’s vote. TynebobI don’t even support Labour but this is a sorry state of affairs. Breaking away from the party offers no strategic gain. It doesn’t make remain any more likely, if anything it diminishes it. Reform only happens from within - wasn’t that the central argument of remainers in the first place? AmouxThe comparisons with the gang of four of 1981 are wrong. Yes both are a splintering caused by a hard left turn in the Labour Party. Yes, the Labour party is currently unelectable like in 1981. The more so because its handling of Brexit will lose it millions of younger votes including e.g. the seat of Canterbury.Most obviously though 2019 is different because there was in 1981 no defining political cause of the day on which to gain political energy. Brexit affords that to this new group and allows them to rehome potentially millions of voters (which the Lib Dems have singularly failed to do under an ailing leadership). Campaigning for a second vote will drive energy and electoral power to this new group, which is the calculation they have made on timing - now and not in six weeks.The second point is the age of these MPs. This is a newish generation of MPs (but with credibility from some experience). The gang of four were all past their political peak - and career trajectory matters in politics. Political change against the populists like May and Corbyn is coming from the new generation, ground up - May and Corbyn are either side of 70 and don’t recognise the need for inter-generational change. Neither are radical practical thinkers and are both in different ways intolerant of change. Any reform agenda they have is going nowhere right now - since they have both have been hobbled by their extremist wings.In this Brexit mess the political change happening now under our feet is as radical as the social change of the 1960’s, and the centrist MP’s see that. They do have a good chance. sussexplanThe Labour Party hasn’t changed since the last General Election when these MPs stood under the Labour banner. It is they who have deserted the Labour voters. They should resign as MPs and fight by-elections as Independents, but they won’t because basically they are gutless. DADAspeakThe left of the party withstood all kinds of pressure to leave throughout the 90s and beyond. Most of us stayed if we weren’t kicked out. These saps have no fortitude. I’ve been a member of the party for 22 years and have never voted any other way. There is exactly the same amount of antisemitism as there has always been in Labour, not very much. As for the hard left machine politics stuff, there was nothing more machine like than the Blair years. And if they think a broadly Wilsonian stance is hard left then maybe they are in the wrong party. Well, Good luck to them. At least they’ll have a job till the next election. But if they let a Tory in may the dead of their constituencies rise up and eat them. DrWhatsonThis is sad, very sad. Labour is supposed to be a broad church, MPs getting hounded out is not a sign of a government in waiting. And the rebels are right on antisemitism, the response from the leadership was too slow and inadequate. One gets the impression Corbyn preferred to soft-peddle when criticising old comrades. That said, this was always going to happen with Brexit. We will see a similar split with the Tories, it’s only a matter of time. Finite187Pity about the number of cynics on here. Surely this is just a symptom of how polarised politics has become and a result of loss of faith in weak leadership, that reasonable people are trying to find moderate ground. I’m all for centrism personally. You can sneer all you like of course but I don’t see much inspiration coming from elsewhere. 89798840The Tories will be loving this and what awful timing. You have to ask: ‘Why now?’. Well they should stand for re-election immediately then, but doubt they’ll do so. They would rather keep the Tories in than see a real, socialist Labour party.

Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker decided to halt further investments at its Macclesfield site in the summer of 2017. Its chairman, Leif Johansson, has said the UK needs to make sure it “does not become an isolated island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean”.David Jefferys, a senior executive at the European arm of the Japanese company Eisai, which makes treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy and breast cancer, told the : “Nobody likes uncertainty. We are not making any new investments in the UK until there is clarity.”Other major drugmakers, such as Novartis and the Viagra maker Pfizer, have announced plans to close UK manufacturing or packaging sites by 2020. Both decisions were made after the June 2016 referendum but the companies said they were not linked to Brexit.Industry executives worry about their post-Brexit ability to bring highly skilled scientists to the UK, while researchers are concerned about being frozen out of EU-funded research collaborations. A no-deal Brexit would almost halve the UK’s funding from the EU’s Horizon 2020 programmme – a £70bn pot aimed at cutting-edge science – a report from the House of Lords said last week.Britain has also lost the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which completed its move to Amsterdam last month, with the loss of 900 jobs.Britain’s life sciences sector – pharmaceutical, medical technology and biotech companies and clinical research and regulatory organisations – employs 140,000 people directly but supports half a million jobs in total when the supply chain is included, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers-commissioned review published in 2017. The sector contributed more than £30bn to the economy in 2015.Companies have therefore ramped up their preparations for a no-deal Brexit, stockpiling medicines, duplicating drug testing, transferring licences and making plans to ship drugs to and from the EU on ferries leased by the government via six new port routes, from Immingham, Felixstowe, Poole, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Ramsgate.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has also chartered a plane to fly in medical isotopes for cancer treatment and other supplies with a short shelf life.Mike Thompson, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry’s chief executive, described Brexit as the biggest logistical challenge ever faced by the industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94dd61cc50f9bdbeef5dcc08c85449a1500b8c7f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b826f762fbafe7a9efd91c2dc3ba6538","title":"tory mps defect independent group soubry allen wollaston","story":"Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen quit Conservatives, citing Brexit and lurch to the rightThree Conservative MPs have quit the party to join the Independent Group founded by former Labour MPs.In what will be seen as a rebuke to Theresa May, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen said the Tories had lurched to the right, adopting Ukip policies and pursuing a hard Brexit.The Independent Group was formed on Monday by seven former Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger and Chris Leslie.

Socialist grassroots activist Jamie Driscoll beat “heir of Blair” Nick Forbes, who has been the leader of Newcastle city council since 2011.Driscoll, a former nurse who went on to set up his own software development firm, who was first elected to Newcastle council last May. He won 2,514 votes to Forbes’s 1,930 in a poll of local Labour members.Described by Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as “a 100 per cent genuine socialist”, Driscoll’s website promises “radical regional renewal”. His policies include setting up a regional bank and a renewable energy cooperative owned by workers and customers.The north-east of England has long been a Labour stronghold and so the party’s candidate has a good chance of becoming the mayor, who will be a figurehead for the local authority areas of Newcastle city, North Tyneside borough and Northumberland county.The mayoral election will take place on 2 May. The winner will preside over an extra £600m of central government funding being devolved to the area, together with powers over the economy, education, skills and transport.Over in Greece, Britain’s ambassador, Kate Smith, has welcomed the news that the rights of an estimated 45,000 UK citizens living in the country will be fully protected in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Describing British citizens living in Greece as “an important bridge of friendship between our two countries”, the Greek foreign minister, Georgios Katrougalos, pledged that whatever happened after 29 March, UK nationals would be able to remain in the country without risk. “There is a substantial Greek community in the UK and a sizeable UK community in Greece and we wish for both of them to continue to enjoy fully the benefits and privileges they had before withdrawal,” Katrougalos wrote in a letter to his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, published by the UK government this morning. With ratification of the withdrawal agreement far from a done deal, Katrougalos said Athens was now obliged “to prepare for the eventuality of a no-deal scenario”. In this scenario too, citizens’ rights is a top priority and our aim is to ensure that both Greek and UK citizens who chose to live, study and work in each others’ countries will continue to do so without obstacles and will fully enjoy similar, if not identical, rights as before withdrawal …The Greek state was working expeditiously, he insisted, on fast-tracking legislation that will “give British citizens and their family members already living in Greece before the withdrawal date, the opportunity to remain here and continue to live, study and work, as well as enjoy social security and healthcare benefits”. Around 30,000 Greeks – not least the country’s well-heeled shipping community – are thought to live in the UK. Kate Smith tweeted: “Delighted that the Greek government has confirmed that in the event of no deal the rights of UK nationals already living in Greece will be fully recognised and guaranteed, in line with the reciprocity offered by the UK to EU citizens.” Ruth Smeeth, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, who has herself reported antisemitic abuse, has ruled out following her friend Luciana Berger in leaving the Labour party.Writing for Jewish News, she said she came from a family of proud jewish trade unionists.I am devastated that my friend, Luciana Berger, has been hounded out of our party for nothing more than being a Jewish woman for standing up against antisemitism within the Labour party, and for being brave enough to speak out.But I will not walk away and allow my once great party – the party of Attlee, of Barbara Castle, of Manny Shinwell or Ian Mikardo and allow it to become a natural home for antisemites.I refuse to abandon the thousands of decent and hard-working members of the Labour party who campaign each and every week for a better country or give up on the 120-year history of a movement which has been the greatest force for social change in our country.We cannot let the racists win and after decades of loudly campaigning against racism wherever I found it, I refuse to be silenced when it is in my own party.So to my Labour family and my Jewish family, I want to say that I have never walked away from a fight and I have no intention of doing so now.Jeremy Hunt has just finished speaking at the Konrad-Adenauer Foundation in Berlin.Asked how likely it was that EU withdrawal would be delayed past 29 March, Hunt said:This is a very important deadline. It is a legally binding deadline. I think what’s changed in the last four weeks is that we’ve now seen a way that we can get a parliamentary majority for the withdrawal agreement – that seemed much more difficult before – and that is essentially to take the deal that we have on the table in its entirety, but make a simple but important change to the Northern Ireland backstop, but one that guarantees the future of the Belfast, Good Friday peace agreement. If we can make that change we are confident that we can get this deal through and the critical thing is that the British attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, needs to be able to change his advice to parliament that currently says that it is possible, if not likely, that Britain could be under the current backstop arrangements, trapped in the customs union, forever, against its will. That is the issue that parliamentarians have difficulty with, so this is really the only way through the current situation and that is why 29 March is concentrating everybody’s minds.Nobody wants a no-deal outcome and I think we now have to do what Europeans do very well, which is to come together around a table and find a compromise that allows Geoffrey Cox to change his advice and then I think we can meet that 29 March deadline.Andy Wigmore, a prominent Nigel Farage associate, has tweeted his congratulations to Derek Hatton for being readmitted to the Labour party, 34 years after being expelled for his membership of the Militant faction.Here is some reaction from people in Liverpool, where he was deputy leader of the council.Newsnight’s Nick Watt again, saying that Tory defections are set for 11am.Earlier this morning, former Conservative cabinet minister Ken Clarke told the Today programme that he believed some Tory MPs were considering joining the new Independent Group. Certainly some Members of Parliament are getting very fed up. There are some, I think - not including me - who probably are contemplating leaving if the party moves too far to the right and no longer represents what they regard as the mainstream Conservative views they have held for all the previous years. I hope that doesn’t happen. I hope it doesn’t come to that.Jeremy Hunt will be giving a speech in Berlin shortly. Speaking this morning, he said achieving a Brexit deal would require statesmanship on all sides. The message is really to everyone that it is possible to find a way through this. Of course it’s challenging, of course there are difficulties. But there is a solution. We can get this deal through Parliament if we can have a deal where the Attorney General can change his advice on the backstop, that’s going to be key to unlocking it. With vision and statesmanship on all sides, this can be done and I’m hopeful it will be.In light of Labour’s announcement that they are consulting on allowing constituents to trigger a by-election if their MP leaves the political party they were elected in, people on Twitter have dragged up this 2010 tweet from Corbyn.Joan Ryan has been speaking on the BBC’s Today programme. She said the party’s problems with anti-semitism only began when Corbyn became leader.We never had this problem in the party before he was the leader. It comes with him, it is part of his politics I am afraid. Labour should be the bulwark against that - against the hard right and their views. Instead of that, inside Labour it is perpetuating anti-Semitism ...He (Corbyn) has introduced or allowed to happen in our party this scourge of anti-Semitism. It has completely infected the party and at every opportunity to deal with it he has not done so. We have had a whitewash report, we have had unprecedented actions of Jewish people feeling they have to demonstrate against the Labour Party in Parliament Square. We have had endless calls on him to deal with the most virulent, vile anti-Semitism - bullying, abuse and aggression - and he has turned away from doing that.Ryan said Corbyn was aiding and abetting a hard Brexit and that many Labour MPs were unhappy with the party’s leadership. “I hope that all like-minded MPs from whatever party will want to join this group. It is early days. It is about trying to change the political weather,” she said.Labour is consulting on extending the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to enable constituents to recall MPs if they leave their political party. At present, constituents can only do this if their MP is jailed or suspended from parliament for 21 days for a serious breach of rules.Jon Trickett, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, said: “Power comes from the people but for too long the overwhelming majority have been shut out. That’s why trust in politics and in elites is rightly falling. “Communities should not have to wait for up to five years to act if they feel their MP is not properly representing their interests, especially with restrictions of the Fixed Term Parliament Act.“This proposed reform has the dramatic potential to empower citizens and will be one of the any measures the Labour party is planning to consult on and announce that will change the way politics in this country is done.”Newsnight’s Nicholas Watt reports that the Conservative MPs rumoured to be planning a departure to the Independent Group could do it shortly before PMQs.Good morning and welcome to the ’s politics live blog.Joan Ryan, the MP for Enfield North, has become the eighth parliamentarian to leave the Labour party and join the breakaway Independent Group, claiming Jeremy Corbyn’s party has become “infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism”. Ryan said she had been a member for four decades – but could no longer remain as a Labour MP.There are rumours that a string of centrist Tories could be poised to follow her in joining the Independent Group, which was formed on Monday by seven former Labour MPs, including Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. Possible candidates are thought to be ardent anti-Brexit campaigners Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, as well as Heidi Allen. In Brexit news – Theresa May is travelling to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, with plans to secure legal assurances that the Irish backstop will not permanently bind the UK into a customs union. Downing Street hopes this will be enough to convince Eurosceptics to back her Brexit deal.The prime minister was forced to admit to Conservative MPs who met her on Tuesday night that the Irish backstop could not be replaced by the “Malthouse compromise” – proposals for a free trade agreement with as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border. However, she stressed that this solution would still be examined in future to help solve the issue of customs arrangements at the Irish border.Here’s a good summary of what the Malthouse compromise was –We can expect more reaction today to the news that the home secretary has ordered Shamima Begum, the teenager who travelled from east London to Syria to join Islamic State in 2015, to be deprived of her British citizenship.Sajid Javid wrote to her family informing them he had made the order, believing the fact her parents are of Bangladeshi heritage means she can apply for citizenship of that country – though Begum says she has never visited it.People are questioning the legality of this move as it is illegal, under international law, to make a person stateless. Begum’s family lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said they were “considering all legal avenues to challenge the decision”, that had left them “very disappointed”.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt will make a speech at a meeting with German counterpart at around 9am, which will be streamed here. We’ll have PMQs at midday as usual and there will be a short debate in parliament about anti-semitism. We’ll bring you all of the other politics news and developments throughout the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac0675e8a0a35a8e887a04a7473b3119a716487/0_67_3546_2128/master/3546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742354fa26c0e6afeeef59d56c37eb0a","title":"jonny may england six nations form psychological effect","story":"The wing is the most improved player in world rugby and, with Wales next up on Saturday, he admits his searing displays now constitute a psychological barrier for opposition teamsAt this rate Jonny May might have to consider changing his surname. Nowadays it is less a case of “may” than “will” when the Leicester wing hurtles towards a try-line, to the point where Wales will have to make special plans for England’s prolific flyer in Cardiff this weekend. Give him half a yard and he will – not may – take full advantage.Twelve tries in his last dozen Tests, including a hat-trick inside the opening 29 minutes against France last time out, is a world-class strike rate by anyone’s standards. The last time he faced Wales he scored twice at Twickenham, the only tries of a low-scoring game. His tally of 22 tries in 42 Tests has elevated him to seventh on the list of England’s all-time try scorers, with the power to edge past, among others, Jason Robinson’s 28 in 51 Tests by the end of the year.Not that “edge past” is May’s modus operandi. The 28-year-old is flying, to the point where France seemed petrified any time the ball came within 10 metres of him. “Yeah, I guess that’s true,” he says, when asked if his form is having a psychological effect on opponents. Never mind English rugby, there is no more improved player in the world over the past 12 months.Even May himself is delighted by the eye-catching progress he is making. While his scorching effort against New Zealand at Twickenham in 2014 is still among his favourite tries, he now has many more strings to his bow. “I am a different player to what I was,” he acknowledges, quick to stress his good fortune to be on the end of an increasingly dangerous attacking backline. “I have scored a lot in my last 12 Tests, more than in my first 30. Is that luck? Maybe it is, but I know my game is better and tries come with that.”It has also done him no harm that the game is tilting towards greyhounds like him who are alert, keen and quick enough to chase down well-executed attacking kicks. “That’s the way the game’s gone at the moment,” he says, nodding. “People want 14 men in the frontline with aggressive defences and players getting off the line. Where does that leave the space? A lot of the time it’s behind them. Will the game change? In 10 years’ time maybe it’ll go back to putting wings back and softer defences. But the way we want to be thinking is: ‘We’re not robots, where is the space?’ There’s always going to be some somewhere.”His burgeoning confidence is a far cry from his early England days when he was mostly happy just to be there. “I wasn’t doubting myself but I knew in the back of my head that I was running out of chances. I knew there was pressure on me. I could do it at Gloucester but hadn’t quite done it here.” He has worked hard to turn himself into a player capable of more than just the odd champagne moment. “What’s been a little bit funny to me is everyone saying ‘wow’ now whereas I feel it hasn’t happened overnight. I feel like I’ve been working hard over a long period of time.”The next goal is to be mentioned in the same breath as New Zealand’s Ben Smith – “He’s the smartest rugby player” – and to distance himself from scurrilous rumours that he was once, ahem, possessed by a chicken. “It’s a bit silly isn’t it? I don’t think at any stage that has happened,” says May, blushing ever so slightly.This week, instead, he is focused on scoring for the fifth consecutive Six Nations game, further buoyed by a pep talk from the former England and Chelsea captain John Terry, who attended training in Bagshot on Tuesday. “He spoke a lot about the leadership group he had at Chelsea. A core group of players setting the standard and how José Mourinho came in and changed the way they train. It was quite reassuring because we could relate to a lot of things he was saying.” Not so reassuring for Wales as they prepare to meet English rugby’s answer to Didier Drogba."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2b1fac6b2b0805c9916249ba8e0c0901ed26f4/0_438_5441_3264/master/5441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d2babdbf296dc37a76bf2db7ba0eb9f","title":"jb holmes slow play golf genesis open","story":"JB Holmes frustrated fans and fellow pros with a five-and-a-half hour round on Sunday. Many believe slow play is affecting the growth of the gameThe video says it all: as JB Holmes paced a 15-foot putt at the Genesis Open, he checked his yardage book thoroughly, presumably looking over notes that he had taken during a practice round. Then he plum bobbed with his putter, stepped away and plum bobbed again, stared down the line of the putt as if he were hunting prey, stood over the ball, then finally hit a shot. Which he missed. It got worse: he then took 50 seconds to hole the one-footer that remained, an age for something even amateurs would consider a tap-in.Despite Holmes breaking the pace of play rule over and over again during the round – the rule book allows players 40 seconds to take their shot – officials failed to give him a penalty. So it was little wonder the round took five-and-a-half hours, 60 minutes more than the suggested pace of play. Holmes is not the only offender on tour. Jordan Spieth and Bryson DeChambeau have faced criticism for their slow play, and early on in Sergio Garcia’s career he was notorious for standing over the ball for what felt like an eternity.I hate to watch slow play because it’s painful reminder that I was a serial offender during my professional playing days. I would step over a shot, only to back off three or four times, and take countless practice swings until finally pulling the trigger. My indecisiveness – driven by anxiety – undoubtedly hurt my playing partners. Not until I received a one-stroke penalty for slow play did I start to speed up. On top of that, other players confronted me and told me how problematic it was for them. The LPGA was right to penalize me, and my playing partners were right to vent their frustration.The PGA don’t seem too worried: when Miguel Angel Carballo and Brian Campbell were given slow-play penalties in 2017, it was the first such punishment in more than two decades. Penalties and fines should be issued though. Slow golfers simply won’t speed up if they know there are no repercussions. It’s working for Holmes: he won the Genesis Open by one stroke.Particularly when golf is up against other sports that don’t allow the luxury of practice shots. Can you imagine if basketball players started mimicking their jump shot in the middle of a game, or if an NFL kicker was allowed as long as he wanted to take a field goal ? The crowds would mercilessly boo, and TV viewers would switch off.Golf doesn’t have much time to figure out a way to draw in a younger audience that is already losing interest in playing and watching the sport. Until the game figures out a way to overcome problems like slow play, one can be sure that more people will tune out, or never tune in at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25264581c69edebfc7fa25f54575386cbedb9d3c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca75484d84780727e42ee938b4c453e5","title":"garcia kuchar holmes tiger woods mexico championship","story":"Spaniard’s petulance, Kuchar’s thrifty touch and Holmes’s slow play sit uneasily with the public but Tiger Woods offers hopeThe World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship is an unlikely saviour for the sport. At the first staging of this tournament, in 2017, players and caddies were affected by sickness to such an extent that an emergency ward by the 18th green would have been a valid addition. The impact on last year was inevitable Rory McIlroy gave the event a miss despite a $10m prize pot, as again did Jason Day. The tournament seen by many as a beacon of light, having prised WGC status away from the Donald Trump-owned Doral site in Miami, was floundering.Is it hird time lucky? The early signs are at least promising. McIlroy will tee up at Chapultepec on Thursday. The resurgent Tiger Woods will do likewise, in what will prove a fascinating insight into interest in this sport’s most famous player in unorthodox professional territory. That there is no cut means a guarantee of Woods for four rounds, useful to analysts and the 14-times major champion himself after the weather delays which disrupted last weekend’s PGA Tour stop in Los Angeles. Whisper it but Augusta National is not so far away.The broader picture, even so early in the year and owing to a bizarre set of circumstances, is that golf could sorely do with some uplifting tales emanating from central America.In no particular order 2019 in golf has seen: murmurs of discontent or confusion relating to new rules squabbles over slow play negative publicity as the European Tour opted to stage an event in Saudi Arabia the vilification of Sergio García after damage done to greens in Saudi Arabia and an epic rumpus involving what Matt Kuchar paid – or did not pay – a caddie. Inidually these events are bothersome enough but, when taken collectively, they portray the image of a sport grasping for happy pills.This week, for the first time in a PGA Tour-sanctioned event, players are permitted to wear shorts for pro-am and practice rounds. A topic so trivial it is barely worthy of a shrug will attract attention as if delivering seismic change on the game. It is little wonder.Victory for JB Holmes on Sunday at the Genesis Open has not been assessed – externally anyway – without reference to his chronic pace of play. The antics of Holmes – procrastinating and pontificating, never ready when it is his turn to play – made this event unwatchable even to seasoned golf fans. Holmes shrugged his shoulders after walking off with a cheque for $1.3m. “There’s times when I’m probably slow but it is what it is,” Holmes said. The inference was simple: “I couldn’t give a …”That the PGA Tour, a members’ organisation, will not appropriately penalise serial slow-play offenders is hardly news. A key point with this will arrive, surely, only if those providing live broadcasts of events decide the product is being meaningfully harmed. Viewing figures for Sunday’s final round would make interesting reading.García’s extraordinary episode in Saudi, a woefully ill-fated European Tour production, was followed by an apology which implicated personal circumstances. Whether the Spaniard’s penalty starts and ends at disqualification from that event is apparently still a matter for discussion.So, too, is how badly Kuchar’s reputation has been besmirched by his low-balling of a temporary caddie when he won the Mayakoba Classic in Playa del Carmen. As public relations blunders go, not least for a player commonly portrayed as more pure than the driven snow, this was incredible. Three months on, due in no small part to media attention, Kuchar’s climbdown led to David Ortiz securing a payment of $50,000. Intriguingly, Kuchar is back in Mexico this week, where one presumes he will keep his head down.What combines García, Kuchar and Holmes is the inevitable public sense that golfers in the upper echelon are out of touch with reality, that they believe they can do as they please without fear of serious penalty. Garcia’s petulance, Holmes’s ignoring of what helps grow the game and Kuchar’s thrifty touch despite outrageous wealth sit uneasily with the public at large.Against this backdrop it is somewhat poetic that Woods, whom by his own admission erroneously operated within his set of rules for too long, offers hope. His comeback from severe injury appeared complete amid success at the Tour Championship last September but should the 43-year-old do likewise on Sunday, for what would be the 19th time in a World Golf Championship, the Masters narrative will gather considerable pace. Woods would be doing his sport a humungous favour. It is uncanny how, the more things change …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91db6439403c708f4f91214a31ebd50b99869f54/157_162_3928_2356/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9a3e8406fb2f79f707d4b8a7012cd31","title":"only fools and horses the musical review vintage gags need better tunes","story":"Theatre Royal Haymarket, LondonAmid the delightful comic dialogue, some of the musical numbers can feel like padding The smooth transition from dialogue to songs in musicals is the genre’s toughest trick, with the talk sometimes feeling like a warm-up for the key material.Unusually, the musical adaptation of Only Fools and Horses – the revered BBC sitcom featuring deluded Peckham entrepreneur Del Boy Trotter – has the opposite problem. The comic dialogue is so delightful that it’s tempting to resent its interruption by songs that sometimes seem to have been included merely to justify the show’s title.This isn’t a serious handicap because John Sullivan (1946-2011) was one of the greatest ever TV writers, bringing to the sitcom a Dickensian knack for characterisation and catchphrases.The creator’s son, Jim Sullivan, and Paul Whitehouse, who also appealingly plays a cameo role as Grandad Trotter, have exhaustively combed the seven series and 16 specials of Only Fools and Horses, broadcast between 1981 and 2011, for the senior Sullivan’s absolute best punchlines, puns, malapropisms, misunderstandings, and sight gags.The two most famous visual jokes in the TV show – involving a wobbling chandelier and a hinged flap on a bar – are either included, or alluded to, both nicely timed to tease the audience’s anticipation of whether they can be staged. Fresh material includes an enjoyable fantasy flash-forward from the show’s 1989 setting to the Peckham of today, where posh coffee, old clothes and houses are being sold to people who may be getting as dodgy a deal as the customers of Trotter Independent Trading.It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that the score came up short. The 20 songs  the work of 11 composers or lyricists. John Sullivan’s theme tune for the TV series, that catchy mockney anthem to tax evasion and Thatcherite values, is flanked by several originals from combinations of Jim Sullivan, Whitehouse, and the late Chas Hodges. The younger Sullivan fittingly invokes Lionel Bart, the leader of the East End musical genre with Oliver and Fings Ain’t What They Use To Be, in a lovely ballad of yearning, called The Girl, and gives Del Boy a witty wide-boy’s love song, Bit of a Sort.But these new numbers are padded out with jukebox inclusions, including two old Chas and Dave hits and the Bill Withers soul song Lovely Day, always worth a listen but, in this musical, feeling as knock-off as the goods on Del Boy’s market stall.Performers in an adaptation of a beloved cultural product face the dilemma of whether to impersonate the original stars. Tom Bennett’s Del Boy affectionately channels David Jason’s jaunty misplaced confidence, while Peter Baker, as the monumentally thick Trigger, is more of a lookalike for Roger Lloyd Pack’s TV turn than a Tussaud’s model could manage. Dianne Pilkington benefits from claiming greater interpretative freedom with Raquel, Del Boy’s love interest, giving the character a strength and iniduality that usefully dilute the period sexism of some of the authentic 1980s pub-talk.The finest collection of vintage gags on the London stage should allow the show to make a fair amount of what Del Boy calls “lovely jubbly”. But, as a musical, a few too many of the songs are, to borrow again from the Trotter lingo, plonkers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1f7c2c142d844d7c7951ba1fe1b7cb19a9556f4/0_233_5049_3029/master/5049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=effc9c3bf3f12967afbd6e809e5246fe","title":"send us a tip on places to see early spring flowers in the uk and win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about wild flowers and colourful displays of early spring blooms in the countryside and gardens open to the publicWe want to hear about great places you’ve enjoyed spring flowers in the UK.

Bravo, Laura DodsworthMe and my vulva: 100 women reveal allFirst things first: the documentary 100 Vaginas (Channel 4) was not about 100 vaginas – it was about 100 vulvas. They were photographed up close and personal by the artist Laura Dodsworth with their owners invited to sit, look and talk about them afterwards as part of a project that follows on from similar ones she has done involving breasts and penises (separately, for the avoidance of doubt). Presumably the powers that be thought calling it 100 Vulvas would lead too many unsuspecting viewers to settle down in anticipation of a programme about the history of Swedish engineering.It was not. It did what it should have said on the tin. My mother was a gynaecologist for nearly 40 years and I now feel like the Queen Mother felt about the bombed-out East End after Buckingham Palace was hit I can look her in the eye. Mainly because I’m never looking at anyone anywhere else ever again.My unwillingness, nay inability, to face one, let alone 100 vulvas is very much the point of Dodsworth’s project and the programme. My labiaversity is symptomatic of a world in which, as the various women who took part noted, its physical appearance and makeup is rarely discussed. And while we are taught endlessly about the blood, birth and pain it will bring to us, its potential for pleasure is only ever really noted in relation to others. “We live in a society that treats women entirely like a cock pocket,” said one woman.That makes it sound like an angry programme. It wasn’t, although there were expressions of it throughout, especially in the sections about rape and other violence done to women. “I wasn’t prepared,” said Dodsworth in voiceover, “for the amount of trauma and pain I’d hear about.” There were accounts from women raped in childhood, too young even to put words to their experience. A woman who had undergone full female genital mutilation (“We were lucky – we could afford a local anaesthetic”) spent six years in hospital and was rendered infertile as a result – “All to prove to my future husband that I was a virgin.” And there were testimonies from women alienated from their bodies by the effects of extreme religious upbringings (“It having a smell, having hair – that’s something I’m still working on,” said a young woman whose fear of sin had induced vaginismus for years), women sewn up incorrectly after birth and other brutal, unacknowledged truths that have ned the ages.What it undoubtedly was, instead, was gently but firmly and relentlessly radical. It’s not until you see a full set of female genitals filling your screen that you realise how little you see anything of or about them in wider culture. It’s not until you hear women laughing and describing how they masturbate and how their bodies change as they do that you recognise that while male masturbation is an openly acknowledged fact (and practically a sitcom staple), the female equivalent is effectively denied, except when co-opted in service to porn.And it’s not until you hear women talking candidly about their own bodies that you realise how little you know about your own, or how your friends feel about theirs. It’s not until you hear women talking honestly about birth or loss of virginity, infertility or menopause that you realise just how much obfuscatory cant you usually hear, and how narrow even the most broadminded approaches and attitudes are.Dodsworth’s photographs and film, and the women who have chosen to spread their legs for her lens, strip away the absurd normalisation of all this in a way I cannot remember having seen before (and I think I would – I was still seeing vulvae when I closed my eyes two nights later). I rarely use the word, because it makes my teeth itch, but it was genuinely empowering. I still don’t fully understand my mother choosing to spend four decades at the business end and I’m certainly still not going to look at mine. But by the end of the hour I was no longer screaming and automatically lunging for the remote whenever another quartet of lips filled the screen. Rome wasn’t built in a day and 40 years of internalised misogyny coupled with natural squeamishness cannot be dismantled in an hour. But in such small increments, here brought about by others’ considerable confidence, bravery, selflessness and artistry, do we measure progress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d237a03ae3fec77bbc5cb038ff90a70ab563ff9/0_225_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28fc449c79e68ab3efc538fa6768591d","title":"bernie sanders announces 2020 run presidency","story":"Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont whose 2016 presidential campaign helped energize the progressive movement and reshaped the Democratic party, has entered the 2020 race for the White House.Sanders, a self-styled democratic socialist who spent much of his nearly 30-year congressional career on the political fringe, cast his candidacy as the best way to accomplish the mission he started three years ago when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,” he said in an email announcing his decision to supporters on Tuesday morning. “Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.”Sanders, 77, running as a Democrat again, believes he can prevail in a crowded and erse field that includes several female and minority candidates, and then beat Donald Trump, whom he called on Tuesday “the most dangerous president in modern American history”.Asked in an interview on CBS on Tuesday morning what would be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: “We’re gonna win.”Whether he can once again capture grassroots support, and whether the energy of his past campaign will pass to other candidates, will likely be a central factor in determining who Democrats nominate to take on the sitting president.The progressive policies Sanders helped popularize in 2016 – Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, tuition-free college, demands to fight climate change more aggressively and to tax the wealthy at a higher rate – have now been broadly embraced by several other presidential candidates.Sanders wrore: “Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.”Sanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump’s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America.Trump 2020 campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: “Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.“But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.”Sanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign.In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, he said: “I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country. I think he is a pathological liar. I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.”After a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the Democrats’ broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and young people.This year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also continued to stumble on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters.Still, no candidate will enter the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list.To this point, Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday night that in the first 12 hours after his launch, the senator raised a stunning $4m from 150,000 donors in all 50 states. The average donation was $27 – the same small-dollar amount he often touted as a sign of his grassroots revolution in 2016.Meanwhile, his launch video was viewed nearly 6m times while he received 330,000 “pledges of support”, roughly a third of his goal to reach one million to build an “unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign”.And a series of early hires for top roles are intended to illustrate Sanders’ commitment to demographic and geographic ersity.Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, will serve as campaign manager. The 39-year-old former aide to Harry Reid will be the first Muslim to manage a presidential campaign. The campaign also hired the progressive organizer Analilia Mejia to be the political director and the activist Sarah Badawi to be her deputy.Yet he will likely face far greater scrutiny, in a growing field already populated by colleagues and allies including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, his closest friend in Congress.Senators Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have all entered the race, as have lower-profile contenders including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Julián Castro and Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana.The former vice-president Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg are all weighing whether to run.With a fractured Democratic field, advisers believe Sanders’ core support, should he retain it over the next year, will be enough to power his campaign in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the early voting states that helped lift his 2016 campaign.He is likely to benefit from a campaign waged by his allies to reform the party’s primary process, which succeeded in stripping voting power from the so-called “superdelegates”, a major source of controversy in 2016 when Sanders lost the battle for the nomination to Clinton.Born to Jewish parents with roots in Poland and Russia, Sanders grew up poor in a cramped apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil rights movement. In 1981, he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. In 1990, Sanders became the state’s sole representative in Congress, where he served until he joined the Senate in 2006.Following the election of Trump, Sanders published a book titled Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. He has four children and is married to Jane O’Meara, a former president of Burlington College and his closest adviser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c7f83ced8bf854cb0fbd9810fedb07408b78ba/0_30_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf52157c33c629c4f551508183abcf34","title":"jay inslee 2020 climate change interview","story":"Washington state’s Democratic governor wants to ‘put the pedal to the metal’ to save the planetThe US stands virtually alone in the world in having a leader who openly dismisses the reality of climate change. But amid growing concern among Americans about the overheating planet, one potential 2020 presidential candidate is aiming to hoist climate to the top of the agenda.Jay Inslee, the gravel-voiced governor of Washington, is poised to enter the throng of Democrats vying to dislodge Donald Trump as president in the 2020 election. He’s made some exploratory moves, visiting Nevada and New Hampshire, and said a definitive decision on running will be taken in “weeks”.“He’s embarrassing. Even Republicans are embarrassed about him,” Inlsee said of Trump in an interview with the . “To fail to mention the greatest existential threat in the world is pathetic. He’s a blip in history we need to get over, and quickly.”Climate change will be the cudgel that Inslee will use in the ballot box fight, an issue he considers perniciously overlooked by America’s leading political figures even as the US is tormented by more powerful hurricanes, scorching wildfires and submerged coastlines.“We need a fundamental shift in our national priorities. There’s too much to risk to belittle climate change,” Inslee said. “You cannot overstate the scope of what needs to be done. We literally have to decarbonize our economy in the next few decades. That’s a huge transition. It’s the largest economic change in history.“I think there’s only one potential candidate who views this as the paramount issue, one candidate who wrote a book on it, only one candidate who has experience as an executive doing these things. That’s me. I sense timidity from others because it hasn’t been done before, but we need to go pedal to the metal.”Twelve years ago, as a US congressman, Inslee co-authored a book that compared the effort of eliminating planet-warming emissions to the Apollo space project launched by John F Kennedy.He’s since attempted to distill these ambitions into policy in Washington – he has been governor since 2013 – by pushing forward plans to expand renewable energy, cut emissions from buildings and promote electric cars. In a state stuffed with progressives who savor their lush forest surrounds, this agenda has by and large received nods of approval. Inslee was comfortably re-elected in 2016.The governor is now looking to an outsider’s run in 2020, centering his campaign on tackling the unfolding disasters of climate change while the worst can still be averted. He hopes that growing public concern over climate change will encourage people to view it as an existential emergency that requires a vast national mobilization.Despite this, many Republicans continue to ridicule climate science and paint any sweeping remedies as fanciful. Many Democrats, meanwhile, have been galvanized by the idea of a Green New Deal, headed by the new congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, although the leading presidential contenders have yet to make climate change a central issue.“We need to blow the bugle on this,” Inslee said. “The Green New Deal is exciting. It raises ambitions and alerts people to the scale of the problem, the scope of it. This wouldn’t be a one-note candidacy it touches on everything from national security to asthma.”Inslee is attempting to drape the monumental challenge posed by climate change in comforting, familiar garb, pointing to his love of hiking, gulping in clean air gazing at snow-capped mountains and enjoying salmon fishing. These homespun enjoyments are under threat.“The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington,” Inslee said. “We were choking. It’s a very personal thing for me.”A child of the 1960s, Inslee hopes Americans will be similarly inspired by the moon landings when contemplating a scenario in which, scientists say, the world must completely revolutionize the way we farm, transport ourselves and generate electricity within a few decades to avoid catastrophe.“This is about the American character as much as it is about chemistry and physics,” Inslee said. “It’s about igniting core convictions of Americans, that we can be innovators rather than anchoring ourselves to old industries.”It’s still unclear, however, whether Americans will want to vote for policies to enable this vision. In November’s midterm elections, voters in Washington state rejected a fresh attempt to implement the country’s first carbon tax. The Inslee-backed initiative lost following a hefty campaign against the measure funded by the oil industry.A separate cap on carbon is in place but may be removed by the state supreme court in March. Another setback in this green, economically robust state would raise further questions over the national viability of bold climate policies.Inslee is a “kind of a square peg in a round hole because he wants to be a carbon warrior”, said the Washington state senator Doug Ericksen, a Republican. “Washington state already has an extremely low carbon footprint.”Perhaps a more realistic goal for Inslee than capturing the Democratic nomination would be to help shift focus on to climate change following years of political and media inertia on the issue.“There will be a lot of lip service to climate change but a lot of the candidates won’t be able to tell a toaster from a solar panel,” said Nick Abraham, who campaigned for the carbon tax and now works at the Washington Environmental Council. “Jay Inslee has been nothing but consistent that this has been his No 1 priority. He’s walked the walk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84ce2724b1c86446f388091af16193e37d0a8b6/0_60_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a01ccc26599c98124f662526d78fd0","title":"deal to free hodeidah may open way to aid in yemen un envoy says","story":"Accord between government and Houthis welcomed but famine ‘still stalks this land’, warns UNA breakthrough agreement on the pullback of forces around the Red Sea port of Hodeidah may open the way for a large increase in the flow of aid into Yemen and prevent the country turning into a “bloody slaughterhouse”, Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen said.The breakthrough was made at the weekend between military officials from the Yemen government and Houthi fighters controlling the port and city, and the redeployment of forces by the warring parties could start “possibly even today or tomorrow”.Assessing the broader progress since an outline UN-sponsored agreement was reached between the parties in Stockholm in December, Griffiths said a “bloody slaughterhouse” has been avoided, but he also warned “famine still stalks this land”.The UN is expected to ask for a further $4bn (£3.1bn) this year to alleviate the suffering of civilians at a conference next week in Geneva.“Yemen, unlike some other conflicts, is solvable,” Griffiths said after months shuttling between Yemen’s key cities of Sana’a, Aden, Hodeidah and Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia – the single most important external player in the three-year conflict.Griffiths, speaking from Amman, in Jordan, said the prospect of the civil war remaining unresolved was terrifying. “A famine is stalking the country, and there is the threat to Red Sea shipping. The alternative to peace is so graphic in Yemen that it is a spur to the goodwill on which I am counting.”Griffiths spoke after Houthi rebels and Yemen government commanders agreed at the weekend to launch the first phase of a redeployment of their troops around Hodeidah, the Houthi-held port and gateway for aid into the country.The redeployment of troops around Hodeidah was agreed in principle in talks in Stockholm in December, but the proposed implementation timetable has been missed badly, leading some observers to claim the process might be doomed.He said the controversial issue of a future depoliticised Hodeidah security force – coastguards in the port and police in the city – had now been passed to him to discuss with the two sides.Griffiths said the agreement was only “an interim, stop-gap arrangement” to demilitarise the city of Hodeidah and did not decide the wider issue of sovereignty in Yemen.He also said aid needed to increase massively to cope with the threat of famine.﻿He added the trust in the UN was also improving. “The UN has had a relationship of ups and down with Yemen. So for the UN to deploy a mission like this into the heart of the conflict is to throw a big stone in the pool. It has a big impact. The UN presence in Hodeidah is destined to be roughly the same size as the current UN humanitarian presence for the whole country, and that in itself is one of the largest UN humanitarian presences in the world.”The additional monitors will ensure a better system to control the breaches of the ceasefire claimed by either side. “The level of violations of the ceasefire has consistently been good over time, given the context. There have been spikes, but … there has not been any taking of territory by one side or the other.”Griffiths said international pressure had helped persuade the two sides to keep talking. “I think the heightened battle for Hodeidah had been continuing for four or five months, and the mass of international opinion wanting this war to stop has had a major impact on military planning. Hodeidah was the centre of gravity for the war, and we have been able to pull back from a bloody slaughterhouse.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db71c36d3fc9e3150a63283b7f3836f6a3900444/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9eb3b9e99c0825e65f5f012472d12cf","title":"jeremy hunt urges germany to rethink saudi arms sales ban","story":"UK foreign secretary visits Berlin after raising concerns about impact of moratoriumJeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, will visit Berlin on Wednesday after urging Germany to exempt big defence projects from its efforts to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, or face damage to both its economic and European credentials.The surprise British lobbying came in a private letter sent to the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas.Germany announced in November that it would provide no further arms export licences to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It has not formally banned previously approved deals but has urged industry to refrain from such shipments for now.The UK has fiercely criticised the killing of Khashoggi, but has refused to ban arms sales. A Lords committee at the weekend said it believed the UK was narrowly on the wrong side of humanitarian law by selling arms to Saudi Arabia for use in the civil war in Yemen.Der Spiegel reported Hunt writing to Maas to say: “I am very concerned about the impact of the German government’s decision on the British and European defence industry and the consequences for Europe’s ability to fulfil its Nato commitments.”In his letter Hunt – who is in Germany to discuss the terms of Brexit – said British defence firms would not be able to fulfil several contracts with Riyadh, including the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado fighter jet, both of which are made with parts affected by the German halt in deliveries to Saudi Arabia.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, at the recent Munich Security Conference appeared to acknowledge the force of Hunt’s argument, supported by the European defence industry, by saying Germany and France needed to coordinate their arms sales export policies more closely if European defence integration is to function.Merkel, in a question-and-answer session after her speech, said: “We have because of our history very good reasons to have very strict arms export guidelines, but we have just as good reasons in our defence community to stand together in a joint defence policy. And if we want … to develop joint fighter planes, joint tanks, then there’s no other way but to move step-by-step towards common export controls guidelines.”Hunt’s letter has been welcomed by the German defence industry. Hans Christoph Atzpodien, the head of Germany’s defence industry association, BDSV, said “the letter shows how Germany’s arms export practices are costing it the ability to partner with its closest European allies”.In his letter, according to Der Spiegel. Hunt also wrote that the German government’s decision to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia would cost German defence firms €2.3bn (£2bn) in revenues by 2026.The German arms export ban is also holding up shipments of Meteor air-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia by MBDA, which is jointly owned by Airbus, BAE Systems and Italy’s Leonardo, since the missiles’ propulsion system and warheads are built in Germany.At the Munich conference Tom Enders, the German head of Airbus, warned the company may have to reorganise its operations as a result of political shifts on the issue, saying political interference was sending business “crazy”.Enders added: “This is escalating very much at the moment. It just so happens that the Germans think that only they have a responsible arms export policy.”The French company Naval Group and Saudi Arabia’s state-owned arms company Sami, which is headed by a German, also signed a joint statement of intent on Sunday, agreeing to build frigates and submarines together.Hunt said the key to the settlement of the Brexit dispute was to be able to get a change to the backstop on Northern Ireland border that was sufficiently substantial for the British attorney general to be able to change his legal advice to parliament."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799495.1550602333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deal done on phibsborough shopping centre and dalymount sites","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin City Council has long wanted to redevelop the properties that form the heart of Phibsborough villageA deal to clear the way for the redevelopment of Phibsborough shopping centre, and neighbouring Dalymount Park stadium has been struck between Dublin City Council and developers.The council bought Dalymount, which sits directly west of the shopping centre, from Bohemians Football Club for €3.8 million in 2015. It plans to build a new stadium and have Bohemians and Shelbourne as tenants.City councillors were this week told that a “settlement” had been reached with the developers, MM Capital, headed by Derek Poppinga and Peter Leonard, to allow both projects go ahead.The developers will pay the council €40,000 for the plot of land and build a public plaza between the centre and the stadium.Dublin City Council wants to turn Dalymount into a €20 million, 10,000-seater stadium and plans to seeks funds from the Department of Sport before the end of April.No sunsetsThe existing stadium was first laid out a century ago. The pitch will be laid out on a north-south alignment, rather than east-west, as it is currently, to ensure better light and to prevent matches being affected by sunsets.Work is due to finish in 2022. Retail space in the centre will be tripled, along with a seven-storey-high student accommodation block.However, the eight-storey 1960s concrete tower cannot be demolished because the developers do not own two of the businesses underneath it: a Tesco supermarket and an Eddie Rockets restaurant. These, and a Tesco off-licence nearby, will remain as they are.Instead the tower will be clad with a metal mesh. Apart from the eight-storey tower, most of the centre today is a one-storey strip mall, topped with car parking.The developers plan to build up the site with heights ranging from three to seven storeys, including new shops, offices, restaurants and student accommodation.Dublin City Council has long wanted to redevelop the properties that form the heart of Phibsborough village, drawing up a plan in 2008 to create a new “village centre”.Bohemians had at the time planned to sell Dalymount and move to a green-field site close to Dublin Airport. However, the plan collapsed when the economy crashed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3799664.1550613325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government two weeks from pivotal brexit decisions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Photograph: James FordeThe Government will begin making major decisions to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit – such as saving vulnerable industries and companies from collapse – within a fortnight.Ministers have been given a “sobering” overview of moves to be taken in the coming weeks as Brexit day approaches without any breakthrough in the current impasse between the EU and UK.British prime minister Theresa May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels today as the UK prepares to outline the legally binding changes to the Brexit deal. Mrs May\u0026nbspis seeking\u0026nbspto address MPs’ concerns about the Northern Ireland backstop, the guarantee that there will be no hard border even if future EU-UK trade talks fail.The commission says the EU wants to help the prime minister to win a majority at Westminster for the deal but has ruled out renegotiating the legally binding withdrawal agreement.At Cabinet in Dublin yesterday, Ministers were told that key decisions to prepare for a no-deal Brexit on March 29th would have to be taken at the start of next month.Sources said this included making “economic interventions and state aid applications to save industries and companies”.The Cabinet will hold three meetings within five days – on March 4th, 5th and 8th – one of which is expected to be held over dinner at Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park.Sources said the Cabinet was told key decisions on how to prepare ports and airports, and to support businesses most at risk from a no-deal Brexit, must be taken at that point. Another meeting will not be held until March 20th due to Ministers travelling abroad for St Patrick’s Day.While it is understood that no specifics were discussed, well-placed sources said there was a reference to the agri-food sector.Food tariffsMichael Gove, the UK environment secretary, yesterday confirmed food imports would be subject to tariffs in a no-deal scenario. The Irish Farmers’ Association said this “demonstrates the gravity of the situation for the Irish farming sector”.The UK has not yet confirmed what level of tariffs it will apply, but if they are based on World Trade Organisation levels, then food will be the sector hit most severely.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has said tariffs on Irish food imports into the UK would come to about €1.7 billion a year.Martin Fraser, the secretary to the Government, is understood to have outlined the activities of the coming weeks to Ministers yesterday. Other key events mentioned at the meeting included further votes in the House of Commons and the publication by the British government of tariff schedules that will apply in a no-deal scenario.Ministers also approved the omnibus legislation that will be needed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The legislation will be published later this week and is set to be debated in the Dáil, with a view to its passage through the Oireachtas being completed by Brexit day.Sources said there was still significant distance between what the UK was asking for and what the EU could offer by way of assurances on the backstop.The British government has yet to put forward a “firm ask”, or definite idea on how to proceed. It is understood to still be talking about ideas Brussels has already ruled out, such as a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit clause from its provisions.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

That’s the impression Leo gives every time questions about the national children’s hospital come up. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinWon’t be long now before Bob comes to the rescue, freeing Leo from the daily drudge of the same questions about the national children’s hospital from the same Opposition dimwits who don’t want to listen to his answers and won’t give him respect.That would be Bob, also known as Brexit Omnibus Bill. Omnibus Bill will be formally introduced to the nation on Friday and his arrival should shunt most of the unwanted hospital attention away from the Taoiseach for a while.What’s the big deal about it anyway? That’s the impression Leo gives every time the subject comes up. As he sees it, we have a simple Over-Under building situation: his critics say the cost of the hospital has massively overrun, he says the cost of the hospital has merely been underestimated. It’s the same thing, just approached from opposite directions. Why will nobody listen to him? He knows absolutely why: spin.The Taoiseach seemed very frustrated on Tuesday when he took to the floor for Leaders’ Questions, having to give answers he has given more than once already about how the project is turning out to be far more expensive than originally thought. It’s not as if the vast sums of money people are complaining about have even been spent yet, he pointed out, again. And when it is spent (and more besides), that cash will represent only a small billion or so drop in a multi-billion euro ocean, or envelope, as they like to call these things around Government Buildings. He cannot fathom the fuss. He rounded on an Opposition which, he charged, is interested only in “spin . . . yarns” and “conspiracy theories”. And to think he was in Lisbon (for the benefit of the Opposition dimwits and media dullards, that’s the capital of Portugal) just a few days earlier from where he tweeted matter-of-factly about having “Caught up with Portuguese PM Antionio Costa over the weekend for a good talk” on the impending European elections, the “ever-closer” relationship between Ireland and Portugal and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.Micheál, Mary Lou and Mattie may have been annoyed about the children’s hospital, but the political correspondents lobby was furious about the lack of transparency surrounding this bi-lateral in Lisbon, having received no notification of the meeting or subsequent information about what the two leaders discussed. This was viewed as a disappointing breach of long-standing protocol and a worrying precedent.Communications But there isn’t much you can tell the Taoiseach which he doesn’t already know, particularly when it comes to communications, an area in which he holds a particular interest. So when Micheál Martin took a swipe at the Government’s determination to “control the message around the overspend” as opposed to controlling the cost overruns, it didn’t play well. The Fianna Fáil leader believes the Government became so obsessed with the PR value around launching this much-needed hospital that it completely overlooked the building management costs.He pointed to all the publicity involved – “the Government was good on the hard hats, it was good on the yellow vests. It was good on the videos, YouTube, you name it there was no lack of communications around this hospital right from the get-go,” he said. Even before the detailed design was worked out, it was a case of “get it on the ground, get boots on the ground, get it working from the public relations perspective”. Conspiracy theoriesBut the Taoiseach had a good answer. There are no politicians or no political advisers on any of the boards or committees overseeing the development. “I think, once again, this sounds like one of your conspiracy theories, deputy Martin.” Wearily, he turned to the Ceann Comhairle and sighed about how Opposition members repeatedly “put out a yarn, perpetuate it for days in the media and when they are about to be found out, they shout you down”.Micheál came back with a zinger. “Taoiseach, you’re correct – the politicians weren’t on the board . . . they weren’t in the sub-committees. But they were in all the photographs, they were in all the videos, they were in every communication presentation for this hospital.” As for yarns, noisy TDs across the floor were not going to be taking any lectures from Varadkar’s Government about spinning the news. In that regard, the Dáil chamber is an assembly of the guilty. Then Micheál reminded Leo about the inidual who was in charge of the Department of Health when a very rosy estimate was advanced of how much the children’s hospital would cost. “When you’re talking about yarns, Taoiseach, the biggest yarn we heard in the last three years was in 2016 when you, as minister for health, said it’s €650 million all in! . . . It’s now €1.7 billion and climbing. So don’t talk to anybody here about yarns, Taoiseach, because people are quite frankly fed up with yarns and fed up with the public relations and fed up with the spin. They want substance and they want facts.”And the argument spin spun again, this time with the Fine Gael leader accusing the Fianna Fáil leader of spin and the Sinn Féin leader saying that the Minister for Health was spinning every bit as much as his boss whereupon the Taoiseach accused Mary Lou of spinning “all over the country” and Mattie McGrath called him a “spinning machine”.Leo says the cost overrun at the hospital is now being cited by Opposition TDs as the reason why local projects are being shelved or delayed, when the reason is completely unrelated. Which is entirely believable.“What is happening in here,” he railed, “is pure cynical spin from the Opposition.” You’d miss the innocence of Brexit. Bring on Omnibus Bill and Bob.

At this point, approximately 10 per cent of that data is now being made public,” he said. “It maps 300,000 sources, almost all of which are galaxies in the distant universe their radio signals have travelled billions of light years before reaching Earth.”The UCD duo are lead authors on one of the papers published, and contributed to several others. Their paper is focused on the jets from supermassive black holes that are pointed towards the Earth. A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing, not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape from inside it.Principal investigator Prof Huub Röttgering of Leiden University said: “If we take a radio telescope and we look up at the sky, we see mainly emission from the immediate environment of massive black holes. With LOFAR we hope to answer the fascinating question: where do those black holes come from? What we do know is that black holes are pretty messy eaters. When gas falls onto them they emit jets of material that can be seen at radio wavelengths.”Prof Quinn said the survey provides “an unprecedented view of galaxies with supermassive black holes at their centres, and how they evolve. The sensitivity and resolution . . . is unparalleled at low frequencies, and the technological advancements required to make this possible are relatively recent.”Creating low-frequency radio sky maps requires significant computational resources. Much of the analysis has been done at SURFsara data centre in Amsterdam, which hosts a vast amount of LOFAR data – more than 20,000 terabytes.“It is the largest astronomical data collection in the world. Processing the enormous data sets is a huge challenge for scientists. What normally would have taken centuries on a regular computer was processed in less than one year,”said Dr Raymond Oonk of SURFsara.Machine learning algorithms were used to automate parts of the analysis, with some of this work being done at UCD on powerful computing clusters.The international LOFAR telescope system consists of a European network of radio antennas, connected by a high-speed fibre-optic network ning seven countries. LOFAR was designed, built and is now operated by the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON).The team aims to make sensitive high-resolution images of the whole northern sky, which will reveal 15 million radio sources in total.“This sky map will be a wonderful scientific legacy for the future. It is a testimony to the designers of LOFAR that this telescope performs so well”, said ASTRON director Carole Jackson. “Just imagine some of the discoveries we may make along the way. I certainly look forward to it.”The Irish station, I-LOFAR was installed in 2017 with funding from Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Business, Enterprise, and Innovation."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3800066.1550645347!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may to return to brussels in bid to salvage brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels, December 11th, 2018. Photograph: Yves HermanReutersFile PhotoBritish prime minister Theresa May makes another trip to Brussels on Wednesday, hoping European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker may prove more yielding than of late to salvage her Brexit deal.With Britain set to jolt out of the world’s biggest trading bloc in 37 days unless Mrs May can either persuade the British parliament or the European Union to budge, officials were cautious on the chances of a breakthrough.The key sticking point is the backstop, an insurance policy to prevent the return of extensive checks on the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mrs May agreed on the protocol with EU leaders in November but then saw it roundly rejected last month by UK politicians who said the government’s legal advice that it could tie Britain to EU rules indefinitely made the backstop unacceptable.She has promised parliament to rework the treaty to try to put a time limit on the protocol or give Britain some other way of getting out of an arrangement which her critics say would leave the country “trapped” by the EU.A spokesman for Mrs May called the Brussels trip “significant” as part of a process of engagement to try to agree on the changes her government says parliament needs to pass the deal.But an aide for Mr Juncker quoted the Commission president as saying on Tuesday evening: “I have great respect for Theresa May for her courage and her assertiveness. We will have friendly talk tomorrow but I don’t expect a breakthrough.”EU sources aired frustration with Britain’s stance on Brexit, saying Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay brought no new proposals to the table when he was last in Brussels on Monday for talks with the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. On Tuesday, the EU responded to UK demands again: “The EU 27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement we cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause,” said Margaritis Schinas, a spokesman for Mr Juncker.Orderly withdrawal“We are listening and working with the UK government . . . for an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU on March 29.”Mrs May’s spokesman again said it was the prime minister’s intention to persuade the EU to reopen the orce deal.“There is a process of engagement going on. Tomorrow is obviously a significant meeting between the prime minister and president Juncker as part of that process,” he said.Mr Barclay and Britain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox are also due back in Brussels midweek and want to discuss “legal text” with Mr Barnier that would give Britain enough assurances over the backstop, British sources said.It is Mr Cox’s advice that the backstop as it stands is indefinite, which Mrs May is trying to see changed by obtaining new legally binding EU commitments.Mrs May needs to convince Eurosceptics in her Conservative Party that the backstop will not keep Britain indefinitely tied to the EU, but also that she is still considering a compromise idea agreed between Brexit supporters and pro-EU politicians.Mrs May’s spokesman said the Commission had engaged with the ideas put forward in the so-called “Malthouse Compromise” but raised concerns about “their viability to resolve the backstop”.The EU says the alternative technological arrangements it proposes to replace the backstop do not exist for now and so cannot be a guarantee that no border controls would return to Ireland.Mr Barnier told Mr Barclay the EU could hence not agree to this proposal as it would mean not applying the bloc’s law on its own border.Eurosceptic politicians said Malthouse was “alive and kicking” after meeting Mrs May on Tuesday.Mrs May has until February 27th to secure EU concessions on the backstop or face another series of Brexit votes in the House of Commons, where politicians want changes to the withdrawal deal.EU and UK sources said London could accept other guarantees on the backstop and the bloc is proposing turning the assurances and clarifications it has already given Britain on the issue in December and January into legally binding documents.–ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  ITV NewsPA WireShamima Begum, the Islamic State sympathiser who left the UK to travel to Syria at the age of 15, has said the British government’s decision to revoke her citizenship is “unjust”.Ms Begum (19) said she was “a bit shocked” when she learned of the move by British home secretary Sajid Javid. She suggested she may now seek citizenship in the Netherlands, where her husband is from.Ms Begum was shown a copy of a home office letter setting out the action against her.Speaking at a refugee camp in Syria, where she is staying with her newborn baby boy, she said: “I don’t know what to say. I am not that shocked but I am a bit shocked.“It’s a bit upsetting and frustrating. I feel like it’s a bit unjust on me and my son.“It’s kind of heartbreaking to read. My family made it sound like it would be a lot easier for me to come back to the UK when I was speaking to them in Baghuz. It’s kind of hard to swallow.”She suggested other returnees are “being sent back to Britain”, telling ITV News: “I don’t know why my case is any different to other people, or is it just because I was on the news four years ago?“Another option I might try with my family is my husband is from Holland and he has family in Holland.“Maybe I can ask for citizenship in Holland. If he gets sent back to prison in Holland I can just wait for him while he is in prison.”Ms Begum fled the UK in February 2015 with two other girls from the same school in east London.Last week, she declared that she wanted to come home with her son.Her comments sparked intense debate about the UK’s responsibilities to those seeking to return from Syria.The case took a dramatic turn on Tuesday when it emerged Mr Javid had opted to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship.The British Nationality Act 1981 provides the home secretary with the power to take such action if it is “conducive to the public good”.A protracted legal battle over the move is now looming. International law forbids nations from making people stateless.The move prompted speculation that Ms Begum, who is reportedly of Bangladeshi heritage, holds dual nationality or would be eligible for citizenship of another country.However, her family’s lawyer Tasnime Akunjee told the Press Association she was born in the UK, has never had a Bangladeshi passport and is not a dual citizen.Lord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum could challenge the decision, and described it as a “complex issue” that could take a while to resolve.“It could run for a very long time through the courts,” he told BBC Breakfast. “I suspect that the result is going to be that she will stay where she is for maybe two years at least.”The home office said the home secretary “has the power to deprive someone of their British citizenship where it would not render them stateless”, adding: “We do not comment on inidual cases, but any decisions to deprive iniduals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly.”Figures for 2017 show that 104 people were deprived of their British citizenship – up from 14 in the previous year. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

This is exactly the right thing to do.”Ms Begum travelled to Syria from her home in east London in December 2014 and married an Isil fighter.Her first two children died, and last week she was discovered in a refugee camp where she issued a plea to return to Britain.But despite saying she wants to bring her baby son up in the peace and security of the UK, she has insisted she has no regrets about travelling to Syria.She has also been criticised for likening the deaths of 22 people in the Manchester Arena terror attack to the civilians being bombed in Isil territory.Earlier the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, had said Ms Begum could be arrested and potentially charged if she ever returned to the UK.But she also acknowledged that travelling to Syria was not an offence in itself, and said the police would need evidence that she had been involved in crime or terrorism in order to bring charges.It comes as a report suggests that many of the girls who have travelled to join Isil are far from vulnerable and naive.A study by the Henry Jackson Society found evidence that while boys tended to join Isil under the influence of family members, girls were more likely to have sought out extremist material on their own.Analysis of 20 cases found that Isil brides tended to be self-radicalised and motivated by the prospect of marrying a man of their choice.Isil schoolgirls\u0026#039 journey into SyriaMs Begum has insisted that while living in the self declared caliphate her only role was as a housewife and mother and there is no evidence of her having done anything wrong.Speaking about the case, Ms Dick said if the teenager returned to the UK she could face questioning but that the current law might not be sufficient to see her prosecuted.The Commissioner explained: If she does, under whatever circumstances, arrive at our borders somebody in her type of circumstances could expect to be spoken to and if there is the appropriate necessity, to be potentially arrested and certainly investigated.”“If that results in sufficient evidence for a prosecution then it will result in sufficient evidence for a prosecution. The officers will deal with whatever they are confronted with.The Commissioner added: “If there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution it is our job to look at the threat they pose if they are returning from Syria and we do that with every single person who comes back from Syria and then manage the risk with colleagues in the (security and intelligence) agencies.Ms Dick went on: Some people returned from that area in the early days who had almost certainly done nothing other than humanitarian aid work – we talked to them and assessed their risk. Many people have come back and just gone on with peaceful lives.”When Ms Begum first travelled to Syria, Sir Mark Rowley, who was then the head of UK counter terrorism, suggested the girls might be treated as victims of grooming, but Ms Dick said: We\u0027re a long way down the road since then.READ MORE: Allison Pearson:  Sorry my heartless little jihadi bride, but you made your bed and now you can lie in itREAD MORE: Allison Pearson: Thank God, Sajid Javid grasped Shamima Begum is the one person uniting Britain – against her Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Brexit latest news: Three Tory MPs defect to Independent Group - Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi AllenConservative Party split: Who are the three Tory MPs who have quit to join The Independent Group and why have they decided to go?Tory split: Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston resignation letter in fullWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Exclusive: Jihadi bride Shamima Begum\u0026#39s baby is British and could return to the UK, say lawyersRAF Engineer becomes most senior woman to have ever served in Britain\u0026#39s armed forcesShamima Begum: Being stripped of my British citizenship is hard to swallow and unjustJoan Ryan becomes eighth Labour MP to quit, blaming \u0026#39culture of anti-Semitism’ under Corbyn leadership100 Vaginas, review: far more than mere titillation – this was an important sex education filmEmpire actor Jussie Smollett’s ‘faked’ racial attack: what really happened?Comment: Sorry Radio Times, but it’s not just the BBC giving us powerful, emotional and brave radioComment: Defeat of Isil wasn’t the West’s original war aim Nigel Farage\u0026#39s Brexit Party has a more obvious slot in UK politics than the Independent GroupComment: Labour is now institutionally anti-Semitic - it has one last chance to save itselfDuchess of Sussex baby shower: inside the New York hotel where old friends and celebrity guests put on a five star party Bernie Sanders calls Trump racist, sexist and a \u0026#39pathological liar\u0026#39 as he launches 2020 presidential bidTeenager in \u0026#39viral face-off\u0026#39 protest video sues Washington Post for $250 millionNHS staff to get safe spaces and 24 hour helpline to avoid burnoutScreen time can be good for children, says Education Secretary, despite fears of parentsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 19 february 2019","story":"A veterinarian from the zoo of Besancon, in eastern France feeds Soa, a female crowned sifaka. The crowned sifaka is a critically endangered species from Madagascar.

The baby would have inherited British citizenship from the mother. The baby is British,” said Fahan Ansari, an immigration lawyer who won an appeal against the Government on behalf of two British-Bangladeshis stripped of their citizenship.Isil schoolgirls\u0026#039 journey into SyriaThe lawyer continued: The baby has every right to come back to Britain though you are not going to separate a newborn baby from its mother. In effect, you have barred that baby from coming back to the UK and left it in a warzone.Government guidance from 2017 states that the Home Secretary has the power to order the deprivation of citizenship if it would be conducive to the public good, and as long as they are not left without any citizenship.Her family\u0027s lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, has said that the family were very disappointed over the move and that they were considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision. He says Begum, who was born in Britain, has never had a Bangladeshi passport and is not a dual citizen.The Home Office’s case is understood to centre on Bangladeshi citizenship law which states that a young person retains the nationality of their parents and therefore their eligibility to citizenship, up to the age of 21 unless they renounce it before then.A similar immigration case brought by Mr Ansari on behalf of the two British men born to Bangladeshi parents was successful because they were over 21. He said the Home Office was appealing the decision by an immigration tribunal.We found that Bangladeshi law was that at 21 you are not a dual national unless you make an active effort to retain it, he said.It seems to be the case that the younger you are, the more vulnerable you are to losing your citizenship than a mature adult of 25-26.The move comes after the teenager returned to the public eye when she was found heavily pregnant living in a refugee camp in northern Syria.She gave birth to a boy over the weekend, having already lost two children, and made pleas for forgiveness and to be accepted back in the UK.On Wednesday she said she was a bit shocked when she learned the Home Office had revoked her British citizenship. I don\u0027t know what to say, she told ITV News.I am not that shocked but I am a bit shocked. It\u0027s a bit upsetting and frustrating. I feel like it\u0027s a bit unjust on me and my son.Shown a copy of the letter revoking her citizenship, she said: I heard that other people are being sent back to Britain so I don\u0027t know why my case is any different to other people, or is it just because I was on the news four years ago?Another option I might try with my family is my husband is from Holland and he has family in Holland.Maybe I can ask for citizenship in Holland.

Air Marshal Gray’s career shows that with hard work, skill and determination, gender is no obstacle to achieving the top ranks in the Armed Forces.“Having served in Iraq as the Chief Engineer for the Joint Helicopter Force, I hope that young girls will look up to Air Marshal Gray and see that a career in the Armed Forces will offer them every opportunity to succeed, irrespective of their gender and background.”Air Marshal Gray takes up her new appointment in March.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Three Tory MPs quit the party over Brexit to join Independent GroupWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Exclusive: Jihadi bride Shamima Begum\u0026#39s baby is British and could return to the UK, say lawyersShamima Begum: Being stripped of my British citizenship is hard to swallow and unjustJoan Ryan becomes eighth Labour MP to quit, blaming \u0026#39culture of anti-Semitism’ under Corbyn leadership100 Vaginas, review: far more than mere titillation – this was an important sex education filmIsil bride Shamima Begum \u0026#39considering challenging\u0026#39 Home Office decision to revoke her British citizenshipEmpire actor Jussie Smollett’s ‘faked’ racial attack: what really happened?Comment: Sorry Radio Times, but it’s not just the BBC giving us powerful, emotional and brave radioComment: Defeat of Isil wasn’t the West’s original war aim Nigel Farage\u0026#39s Brexit Party has a more obvious slot in UK politics than the Independent GroupComment: Labour is now institutionally anti-Semitic - it has one last chance to save itselfDuchess of Sussex baby shower: inside the New York hotel where old friends and celebrity guests put on a five star party Bernie Sanders calls Trump racist, sexist and a \u0026#39pathological liar\u0026#39 as he launches 2020 presidential bidTeenager in \u0026#39viral face-off\u0026#39 protest video sues Washington Post for $250 millionNHS staff to get safe spaces and 24 hour helpline to avoid burnoutScreen time can be good for children, says Education Secretary, despite fears of parentsThousands of girls as young as 13 turn to cosmetic surgery as social media pressures mountWorkers over 50 have fuelled rise in UK employment over past decadeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6258776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg","title":"bitcoin price latest samsung galaxy s10 cryptocurrency wallet rumours release","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

We also have concerns that prices could rise at a large number of their petrol stations.Mr McIntosh added: “These are our provisional findings, however, and the companies and others now have the opportunity to respond to the analysis we’ve set out today. It’s our responsibility to carry out a thorough assessment of the deal to make sure that the sector remains competitive and shoppers don’t lose out.”A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market. The CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases. “Combining Sainsbury’s and Asda would create significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices. Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits. “We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers’ pockets, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty. We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go.

By the time they take their GCSEs they are, on average, 19 months behind their peers in attainment.He said: “Screens can be an easy distraction for children, but harnessing the power of technology to support early communication and development means that we have another tool in our arsenal to help young kids develop those skills.”Author Philip Pullman previously said that parents needed to get off their mobile phones and speak to young children to boost their vocabulary.It came after early years experts suggested that children had poorer language skills because parents were too distracted by their digital devices to help them out.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We also have concerns that prices could rise at a large number of their petrol stations.Mr McIntosh added: “These are our provisional findings, however, and the companies and others now have the opportunity to respond to the analysis we’ve set out today. It’s our responsibility to carry out a thorough assessment of the deal to make sure that the sector remains competitive and shoppers don’t lose out.”A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s and Asda said: “These findings fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market. The CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases. “Combining Sainsbury’s and Asda would create significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices. Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits. “We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers’ pockets, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty. We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Only very detailed future archaeological research will stand a chance of finding the route and cracking that particular mystery.In the first, more maritime\u0026nbspscenario, the stones would potentially have been moved by raft (or catamaran) down Pembrokeshire’s river Taf into the Bristol Channel and then along England’s river Avon to within 20 miles of the Salisbury Plain site earmarked for Stonehenge.In the second scenario, the stones would have had to be carried by stretcher or hauled on sledges (or possibly rollers) for long distances over often extremely challenging terrain (with only limited opportunities for river transport).This second method would certainly have had ostentatious political and ideological advantages – but it would have required vast amounts of manpower, time, effort and intertribal or interclan acquiescence.The discovery of the stone quarrying tools, which date\u0026nbspto the approximate time of the construction of the first stone phase of the monument (c 2900BC), proves\u0026nbspbeyond reasonable doubt for the first time\u0026nbspthat Neolithic people quarried the Welsh stones that ended up being used to build the world’s most famous prehistoric temple.But why did the builders of Stonehenge want to get their standing stones from 175 miles away when they could have used perfectly good local stones from Salisbury Plain?The answer is probably genealogical. Chemical\u0026nbspsignatures found in the bones of early Stonehenge people\u0026nbspsuggest many of those iniduals were originally from western Britain,\u0026nbspnot from Salisbury Plain. It is therefore conceivable that the stones of early Stonehenge were brought to Salisbury Plain from the area associated with the builders’ ancestors.Fascinatingly, in much later (medieval) Arthurian literature, the stones of Stonehenge are said to have been brought by the magician Merlin from the far west (although, in the legend, from Ireland, rather than southwest Wales).The fact that the stones were brought from Pembrokeshire to Salisbury Plain raises another key mystery. If indeed they were transported to their new home as clan or tribal heirlooms, then it suggests they already possessed great significance. And that implies the possibility that they had already functioned as a ritual monument (ie\u0026nbspas standing stones) in Wales, long before they were taken to Salisbury Plain.So the big archaeological question is whether the initial stones of Stonehenge were second hand or freshly quarried for use so far away. If the former theory is correct, then the original Stonehenge was actually in Pembrokeshire – not in England. The hunt is therefore now on for the original site of this potential Welsh proto-Stonehenge.Without doubt Salisbury Plain’s world-famous prehistoric temple still holds many secrets – but archaeological research over the coming years is likely to reveal them.British people ‘more familiar with Eiffel Tower than Stonehenge’Groundbreaking research reveals origins of people who built StonehengeThousands gather for summer solstice sunrise at Stonehenge Stonehenge tunnel ‘could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age’Congestion expert warns worst Christmas jams will be at StonehengeThe discovery of the quarrying tools – published today in the British archaeological journal\u0026nbspAntiquity –\u0026nbsphas been made by a team of archaeologists and geologists from UCL, Bournemouth University, the University of Southampton, the University of the Highlands and Islands and the National Museum of Wales.Professor\u0026nbspPearson said: “What’s really exciting about these discoveries is that they take us a step closer to unlocking Stonehenge’s greatest mystery – why its stones came from so far away.“Every other Neolithic monument in Europe was built of megaliths brought from no more than 10 miles away. We’re now looking to find out just what was so special about the Preseli Hills 5,000 years ago, and whether there were any important stone circles here, built before the bluestones were moved to Stonehenge.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

Umunna, Leslie and Smith\u0027s constituents overwhelmingly voted Labour and have ended up with an MP in coalition with the Tories.This is unfair, undemocratic and dishonest. The only decent thing to do is to call a by-election and let their constituents decide.\u0026nbspIn response to three Conservative MPs resigning from the party, Theresa May has issued a statement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am saddened by this decision – these are people who have given dedicated service to our party over many years, and I thank them for it.\u0026nbsp“Of course, the UK’s membership of the EU has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. Ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy.\u0026nbsp“But by delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the British people we are doing the right thing for our country. And in doing so, we can move forward together towards a brighter future.”\u0026nbsp“I am determined that under my leadership the Conservative Party will always offer the decent, moderate and patriotic politics that the people of this country deserve.”BREAKING: Conservatives Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston have resigned from the party to join the newly-formed Independent Group in the House of Commons.Speaking in Berlin on Brexit, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said: I am confident, Theresa May is confident, the British government is confident, on the basis of huge numbers of discussions with UK parliamentarians, that if we solve the issue of the backstop then we can pass this deal through parliament.Insisting that the March 29 deadline could be met he said: The issue about an extension is whether that really solves anything.The last thing that people in the UK and indeed the rest of the EU want is Brexit paralysis with this issue hanging over Europe like a shadow.I think people want to move on, they want to demonstrate that we can have a Brexit that respects the referendum result but also means that we remain the best of friends with our neighbours in Europe.Conservative MP Philip Lee - a backer of a second referendum - has told Sky News he is not quitting the party amid speculation\u0026nbspthat three MPs could do so.\u0026nbspI\u0027m staying to fight, he said.Veteran Conservative Ken Clarke said he believed some Tory MPs were considering joining the new Independent Group.Certainly some Members of Parliament are getting very fed up, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.There are some, I think - not including me - who probably are contemplating leaving if the party moves too far to the right and no longer represents what they regard as the mainstream Conservative views they have held for all the previous years.I hope that doesn\u0027t happen. I hope it doesn\u0027t come to that.Speculation is swirling around Westminster that three Conservative MPs will\u0026nbspresign from the party this morning in order to join the new Independent Group.\u0026nbspPro-EU MPs Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen are all reported to be on the verge of quitting. They are refusing to comment, but some reports suggest their resignations could be announced around 11am.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is not the forthright position many campaigners hoped to be in at this stage in the Brexit process.It is now not even clear if this more caveated approach to winning a new referendum, or\u0026nbspa more direct one, will be put in front of MPs for a vote on 27 February – which is being hailed as “high noon” for the country’s approach to Brexit in other respects.Last October when 700,000 people poured out on to the streets demanding a new referendum, the feeling was that momentum was swinging in their direction, that Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspwould ultimately have no choice but to back one and that, if it came to a vote in the Commons at the right time, MPs would push it through.Since then\u0026nbspall sides have become stuck in the bog of Brexit’s political complexity. Those wanting a Final Say will hope that the split in Labour’s ranks does not distract\u0026nbspfrom that overriding aim, but rather focusses minds on a second referendum.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.Last year, 27 of the 28\u0026nbspEU-member-state ambassadors in Beijing (Hungary being the exception) signed off a report saying the Belt and Road\u0026nbspproject “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.The British ambassador was one of the signatories. But Philip Hammond, on a subsequent visit to Beijing, declared: “I was privileged earlier this year to represent the UK at the first Belt and Road forum and one of the things we will discuss is the opportunity for closer collaboration in delivering the ambitions of the Belt and Road programme.”The Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) report –\u0026nbsp“UK Vulnerable to Chinese Influence and Interference Operations”\u0026nbsp– calls for scrutiny of the “risk of financial dependencies being set up through consultancies offered to retired politicians, who the CCP\u0026nbsphopes will push a sympathetic narrative.“The case of former British prime minister David Cameron, who is involved in a large China fund which aims to invest $1bn\u0026nbspin BRI projects, has gained some attention.“The question of ‘elite capture’ by the CCP has not been closely examined. It should be, including the issue of how much time should elapse between government service and working for Chinese state or quasistate organisations.”There is no suggestion in the report that the Chinese have tried to influence Mr Cameron.Turkey risks angering China by criticising treatment of Uighur MuslimsTrump \u0027most excited\u0027 about death penalty for drug dealers in ChinaChina’s birth rate falls to lowest level in modern historyVideo of Muslim poet ‘jailed for song’ proves he’s alive, China saysThe Rusi document, compiled by Charles Parton, a former diplomat, states: “The UK’s departure from the EU may increase the Chinese Communist Party’s desire to interfere, as it seeks to implement further a ide-and-rule\u0026nbspstrategy, aimed at imposing its global vision and promoting its interests”.The report calls for the development of “systems to prevent non-transparent financing of political activities and lobbying by CCP-backed iniduals and organisations the ultimate donor should be clear, even when monies are channelled through British citizens.”There are differences, on the whole, between the types of interference by the Kremlin and Beijing, according to the report.“Except in the sphere of espionage and cyberattacks, CCP interference is not of the Russian kind, which is more deliberately hostile, even destructive. It is more subtle, incremental and often under the radar, although it is occasionally brazen.”The main goal, it is held, is to promote a “ruthless advancement of China’s interests and values at the expense of those of the west, including through actions which encourage self-censorship and self-limiting policies”.It points, as an example, to universities and research centres where “junior academics often self-censor to avoid having access to research opportunities withdrawn. Chinese interference in academic freedom also extends to putting pressure on academics, born in China and working in the UK to support the CCP line”.There must be great caution, the report maintains, in allowing Chinese participation in the UK’s critical national infrastructure.CCP interference is not of the Russian kind, which is more deliberately hostile, even destructive. It is more subtle, incremental and often under the radar, although it is occasionally brazenThe search for an optimistic post-Brexit future must not blind the UK to the risks involved, the report cautions. “The UK needs to realise that behind the enticing, but essentially meaningless, language of ‘win-win’ or ‘shared future for mankind’ lies a ruthless CCP agenda to advance its and China’s interests.”“The UK will not change that, but its aim must be to channel it into a genuinely balanced relationship. In achieving that, language is important: if there must be talk of ‘the Golden Era’ (and within China, the phrase does help UK interests), the UK should not allow it to cloud its perceptions. The UK’s goal must be genuine reciprocity and an equal, mature and comprehensive relationship.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

Heres who they are and why they decided to break away.They are a group of MPs who all began resigning from the Labour party on February , .It was decided to form a breakaway group in protest at the hard-left direction of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.Then in a twist three Tory MPs quit their party and joined the breakaway group.It is not yet a political party, and the  MPs will sit in the Commons as independents.However Chuka Umunna - seen as the likely leader - confirmed they plan to start a new centrist party ready to fight the next election.The group say they will offer a new alternative to what they call broken politics, and hope Tories and Lib Dems will join them in the centre ground.It is supported by Gemini A Ltd, a company registered at Companies House on  January  with Gavin Shuker as its sole director.Its Twitter account racked up almost , followers in the first day.They are furious at Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance and his handling of the anti-Semitism scandal that still dogs the party.Jewish MP Luciana Berger - who has faced vicious abuse from left-wingers - said: I cannot remain in a party that I have come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic.Chris Leslie said the party had been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left.And Mr Gapes blasted: I am sickened that the Labour Party is now a racist and anti-Semitic party.Mr Umunna, seen as the most likely leader of the group, said: Fundamental change is needed.The established parties are not up to this change. They can’t be the change as they have become the problem.A statement published on the groups new website laid out their ideology and political position.In short, they support a social market economy, freedom of press, environmentalism, and devolution and localism.If Labour splitters started their own party, it would likely aim for the centre-left ground formerly occupied by Tony Blairs New Labour.They would pursue social democratic policies and would be against a hard Brexit, and possibly hoping to reverse Brexit altogether.As well as Labour MPs, the breakaway party would hope to attract Lib Dems and pro-EU Tories.But they would face a struggle to make an impact as the electoral odds are against smaller and less established parties.Part of the reason is the first-past-the-post voting system in general elections, which favours the two biggest parties.In  an alliance of the old Liberal party and the SDP - formed by breakaway Labour politicians - won more than  per cent of votes nationally but only  seats.Up to  current MPs fear they will fall victim to a massive purge by new left-wing activists who have flooded the party.Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper are among those said to be at risk of deselection in their constituencies.Some may decide to jump before they are pushed, switching to a new centrist party that has long been touted in Westminster.Until February , fed-up MPs had shied away from quitting and the group of seven rebellion threw the party leadership into fresh turmoil.Sources claim ten more Labour MPs are ready to quit and join The Independent Group, and six Tories could join them.If they can get  MPs, the Independents will be the third biggest group in the Commons, ahead of the Scottish National Party and the Lib Dems.One senior Labour figure said: “It’s a matter of time before others go.“I think you’ll see another ten at least leave Labour in a matter of weeks.One insider added he also expected Labour peers Waheed Alli, Margaret McDonagh and John Reid to sit as Independents in the Lords.In a sign of Labour’s sht under Mr Corbyn, it separately emerged on Monday night that s militant Derek Hatton was back as a Labour party member after a -year exile.He welcoming back into the fold was denounced by Labour moderates."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000457256457.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour say jihadist teen shamima begum should be allowed back into britain","story":"One of the partys law bosses insisted the -year-old is entitled toto this country.And Diane Abbott has spoken out against removing her British passport in order to keep her out of the UK.Labours intervention comes as ministers work out a way to keep Begum out amid fears she could present a serious threat.Sajid Javid blasted in the Commons: If you back terror, there must be consequences.He is understood to be considering revoking her British citizenship on the grounds that she is eligible to be a citizen of Bangladesh.But Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Shadow Solicitor General, suggested Begum should be allowed back in.He said: Can the Home Secretary confirm first that UK citizens are entitled toto this country under international law, but should be held to account upon their  Under international law, the Government cannot make people stateless.He added that Brits whove fought for ISIS should expect to face justice in legal processtheyto Britain.Shadow Home Secretary Ms Abbott said in a statement: “We are not in favour of making people stateless, that’s a punishment without due process.If there are reasonable grounds to suspect that anyone who is entitled toto this country either committed or facilitated acts of terrorism, they should be fully investigated and where appropriate prosecuted.Today Begum, who gave birth over the weekend, said the Manchester Arena bombing was justied retaliation for the bombing of ISIS bases.She says she wants toto Britain so her infant son can be cared for on the NHS."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0004699955541.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"independents cant reverse brexit democracy","story":"But there is a fatal flaw in the Remainers’ pitch to the nation.You cannot “build a new politics” when your foundation stone is an attempt to reverse the biggest democratic mandate in our history.That is not a respectable position.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure.

As he put his hand over my mouth I bit down as hard as I could.”The pair tumbled to the ground in the struggle.Terra then used her heavy boots to kick the kne from her attackers grip and as it fell to the pavement just inches from her right hand she grabbed hold of it tightly.“I just started stabbing him,” she continues. “I thoughthe got back up he’s going to kill me.Terra stabbed John  times - leaving wounds in his shoulder, arm, back, chest - and one in his left eye through to his brain.Four days after the attack his le support was turned off.Terra was questioned and released when police realised shed acted in self-defence.Terra has ed to the public eye since the arrival of the Netflix series on Valentines Day.She has even been on TV to tell her story on The Today Show in the US.Also active on Instagram, Terra has befriended Meehans two daughters Emily and Abigail and often posts pictures with them.On Terras website she writes: I’m  years old, and I live in Orange County, Calornia, and Henderson, Nevada.I created Terranewell so I could have a safe place to share my le.You may have heard my name from an article, podcast, or TV show, but you don’t really get to know the real me from those.Here you will get to know me as I share about travel, music, hiking, my dog, everything dogs, zombies, fashion, PTSD, and other interests.Eric Bana, who plays Dirty John, said the real Terra was scared to meet him during filming of the Netflix series.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we failed.Available data on sea-level rise and weather events in the Torres Strait region “point to human-induced climate change being the root cause of the loss of the Bramble Cay melomys”, a study released in  said.The Melomys rubicola, considered the Great Barrier Reefs only endemic mammal species, was first discovered on the cay in .Europeans were known to shoot the largish rodents for sport."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004594082961.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit benefit boost poverty amber rudd","story":"Amber Rudd hailed a fresh report which said the new benefits system will help pull hundreds of thousands out of poverty in future, but vowed to do more to make it work.New research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation showed that the system had the potential to help desperate Brits, taking , working families out of poverty.They think that .million working families are set to see their incomes increase by an average of £, a year on the new system.Since more money was pumped into the scheme in last years budget - including a £ hike to the amount people can work without getting their benefits slashed - there will be more winners.The Work and Pensions boss said the research showed that the new system can help parents out of poverty - but vowed to continue making vital changes to the system.Ms Rudd told The Sun: It is good news that this research shows that Universal Credit has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of parents move into work and out of poverty.And while I know that Universal Credit is a force for good and working for the vast majority of people, we cannot be complacent and I will continue to make improvements to the system where they are needed.The research also showed that .million working Brits will still be an average of £, a year WORSE off.JRF agreed with The Sun that Brits needed to get paid faster, keep more of what they earn and get desperately needed help with childcare to iron out the problems with the flagship system.Our Make Universal Credit Work campaign is calling on ministers to fix these issues before its too late.But work coaches told experts that there was too much reliance on the advance payments system, which plunges claimants into debt from day one.The charity wants to see Brits paid within two weeks, not five as it is right now, and for Ms Rudd to end the benefits freeze one year early - next April.The Work and Pensions Secretary has vowed to end the freeze, but working families still face losing £ in the last year its in place.Joseph Rowntree Foundation Chief Executive Campbell Robb said today: Universal Credit has the potential to loosen the grip of poverty, but with underfunding and a bad system it can end up tightening it instead.The Secretary of State has shown willingness to get this system working right – and the Government has demonstrated a commitment to support working families by raising the work allowances in last year’s Budget.The Suns campaign is right to highlight the fact that waiting for five weeks without savings and when you are used to regular wages is dficult for everyone but impossible for some. Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000447080221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british kids fattest europe asthma","story":"They also have the highest death rate from asthma, an international study has found.And when it comes to exercise, only Portugal has more young couch potatoes.The analysis by the Nuffield Trust and the Association for Young People’s Health found that the UK’s under-s are getting unhealthier despite more of them not taking up cigarettes and booze.One in five has a chronic health condition such as diabetes.And . per cent of  to -year-olds are obese.Louise Meincke at the World Cancer Research Fund said: “Children who are obese are more likely to be obese as adults, and this increases their risk of  cancers and other conditions.”Nuffield Trust chief exec Nigel Edwards said: “Young people are holding up their side of the bargain, with more of them choosing to smoke and drink less, yet our health system seems to be getting something badly wrong.”But Jacqueline Cornish from NHS England said: “The NHS Long Term Plan delivers a new, dedicated programme for young people’s health.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

indoctrination played its part but undoubtedly, so too did the romantic ideals of a -year-old girl who watched a couple of IS propaganda videos featuring fired-up jihadi fighters and naively flew off to wed one.Within ten days of landing, she was married to Dutch-born Yago Riedijk, then , who’d been brought up in a “lovely” middle-class family in Arnhem before converting to Islam and joining IS.Tellingly, Shamima says he treated her “really well”, that she still loves him, and “I wouldn’t have found someone like him back in the UK.”In other words, in her deluded young head, a convicted terrorist was quite a catch.But fast-forward to now, and by her own admission, -year-old Shamima is “not the same silly little -year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago.”She says that the whole experience — including losing her first two children and seeing a decapitated head in a bin — has “made me tougher, stronger”.And as we know from her unrepentant interviews, she feels she has done nothing wrong, displays a breathtaking sense of entitlement when demanding our sympathy, and, most heinously of all, feels that the Manchester terror attack was “fair justication” for the women and children killed in the Islamic State.So, as the “tougher, stronger” adult she now is, she must be treated as such and left where she is.Revoking her British citizenship, as Home Secretary Sajid Javid did, is a good start.But the letter sent to her parents has made it clear that her family has the right to appeal and all early indications are that they will.But in the

to UK citizenship  Or indeed Dutch If so, given that we routinely remove children from homes where their welfare is under serious threat, we should have no qualms in removing a baby from a mother who is wilfully displaying terrorist sympathies, has lost two children already — one to malnutrition — and is currently living in squalor.AndShamima is as concerned about her baby son’s wellbeing as she claims she is, then she should willingly hand him over to either the UK or Dutch authorities for fostering with a family where love, rather than hate, is the norm.MODEL Abbey Clancy says she wanted to

Neither would comment yesterday.Downing Street is understood to have axed a number of Ministerial speeches this week through fear of upsetting ‘Remainers’ who could quit the party to sit alongside the ‘Independents’.  One insider said: “No. is on high alert.”Chuka Umunna and six other Labour MPs stunned Westminster on Tuesday by leaving the Labour party in protest at Jeremy Corbyn’s stance on Brexit and failure to stamp out anti-Semitism. They will sit as ‘Independents’.But speaking yesterday Mr Umunna said the seven hoped to register as a new political party “by the end of the year”. A separate source said the seven had already been inundated with emails and donations.The MPs who are staying on as ‘Independents’ took their seats alongside the Lib Dems in the Commons yesterday.  The Sun revealed yesterday that senior Tories fear up to six Conservatives could walkout to join the new grouping.But yesterday one of them, Antoinette Sandbach, ruled it out for now, saying the Tories were a “broad church”. Another linked with leaving, ex-Tory Minister Nick Boles said suggestions he could walk were “b*****ks”.Amid the bitter fallout from Tuesday’s historic announcement, Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell struck a conciliatory tone yesterday by admitting Labour had to “reach out” to stop others leaving.But it emerged party chairman Ian Lavery had already written to members in each of the seven MP’s constituencies to start the process for selecting new Labour candidates in each patch. And ex-‘Militant’ Derek Hatton incensed moderate MPs by saying the seven “must resign” and fight by-elections on his first day back as a Labour Party member.Speaking in London yesterday Jeremy Corbyn said he “regretted” the decision by the seven to go.  But he side-stepped questions about whether he would act on Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s demands and shake up his Shadow Cabinet team. Last night it emerged Mr Watson has been shut out of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet discussions on Brexit.Mr Corbyn said: “I recognise that being leader of the party means you have got to take people with you, and I am determined to do that so that we can – when an election comes – present those policies to the public as a whole.”Business Minister Richard Harrington - an ardent Europhile - yesterday said he “perfectly understands” why the Labour ‘Gang of Seven’ left.  Challenged whether he could join her said his battle was inside the Conservative Party.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I felt like doing that to the people who organised it.Others took to social media to express their fury.Facebook user Lula Phillips posted: “My husband and son have just left, I can’t believe you have charged people for that absolutely shocking non-event.”Sharmagne Spencer also posted on the event’s Facebook page, saying: “Avoid! Avoid! Really not worth it, my boys were miserable, queuing is shocking for everything.”Oliver Phillips said he and his son Theo, , were at the front of the queue when the event opened at am, by which time early-bird ticket holders were already leaving.He took particular aim at the cave experience, saying it was: a trailer, no bigger than a car, with a tunnel through it.Philip Hinchlfe, from Norwich, who brought his -year-old son, said: “He’s out in the field playing with sticks, he’s having more fun doing that than he did at this event.”Lord admitted there were problems with queues as eight of his  staff had not turned up on Saturday.He admitted that he had given a refund to everyone who had asked, but he refused to say how many people had claimed one, saying: “We are dealing with people on an inidual basis.”High numbers of under-s have had treatment for injuries such as repetitive strain in the past decade, NHS Digital figures show, while accidents outside have plunged.Campaigners warned of raising “battery children”.Education Secretary Damian Hinds is one of many calling for kids to spend more time away from their screens. We heartily back his call — and schools and parents alike should listen.We reckon climbing trees is a lot more character-building than playing Fortnite.But Lord added: “There are a lot of people who have told me they have had a fantastic time and their kids have thoroughly enjoyed it.“We will take everybody’s feedback into consideration and we will act on it.”Father-of-two Mr Lord who was assisted at the event by his we Vicky had already sold tickers for two more Fortnite festivals in Spalding and Newark, Nottinghamshire, taking place next month and in April.But he emailed ticket holders last night to say that his firm had ceased trading and they would be joining his company’s creditors.The businessman said: “It is with heavy hearts and sadness that we write to our Fortnite Live ticket holders with an update on the Fortnite Live events, organised by Exciting Events Limited.“Fortnite Live has always been an unofficial event created by Fortnite fans for Fortnite fans, and was designed around children playing the game, with the activities brainstormed by an audience of - year olds.”“Yes there were longer than expected entrance and wristband token queues at the beginning of the day, which caused impatience and frustration for some parents.“The organisers worked through the night to address the queuing issue and emailed all of the Sunday Ticket Holders with regards to the refund policy.“We also drafted in more staff for the Sunday, providing a speedier entrance and then completely cut out the next queue by offering wristband and tokens to purchase whilst in the entry queue.“This was successful and Sunday visitors enjoyed a fantastic atmosphere, with less queuing to get into the event.”Mr Lord said the legal action by Epic Games had forced Exciting Events to shut and parents would have to wait for assets to be cleared before refunds could be issued.He added: “Epic Games, the owners of Fortnite, have now forced the shut down of the two pre-booked future Fortnite Live events, with the immediate removal of all promotional communication from the public domain, which is why you will have seen all of the Fortnite Live media disappear.“These proceedings by Epic Games has had a catastrophic impact on the company’s ability to trade, which has forced Exciting Events Limited to cease all trading activities immediately and the director of Exciting Events will now seek to limit the losses to third parties as far as possible.”Mr Lord said media coverage had failed to mention the “high tech gaming area”, but a member of staff from the event disagreed.The worker said: “There were just  consoles for more than , people to play. Children were waiting for up to two hours and some had never played the game.“When they sat down to play they would die and be told to get off instantly, after waiting for so long.”A spokesperson for Epic Games said: The quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us, whether its inside the game or at official public events like last years Fortnite Pro-Am.“Epic Games was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich and weve issued a claim against the organisers in the High Court of London."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470334091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british tourist prague newcastle friends passport notices","story":"Allan Poole, , flew from the Czech capital to the UK via Amsterdam with KLM on his mate’s passport and the airline and airport authorities never realised.Allan, from Whitely Bay, accidentally picked up Steve Vincent’s passport which was checked or scanned at least four times during his trip home despite the names having no resemblance.KLM staff at the boarding gate didn’t notice anything was wrong and neither did border security in Amsterdam or Newcastle.Steve, , also from Whitley Bay, is now stranded in Prague until the British Embassy provide him with an emergency passport.A spokesman for the British Embassy in Prague said it was not unusual for people to travel on other peoples passports.People do travel on , they dont get checked when they come out and stuff like that, the spokesman said.Its quite common actually, to be honest with you, people do travel on other peoples passports accidentally, it does happen.It even happens in the UK, people come out on perhaps a childs passport thats sometimes not checked, it does happen.Border controls sometimes dont look, I dont know for what reason.A spokesman for the Home Office said: Border Force officers are rigorously trained to prevent those using fraudulent documents from entering the country.Our officers are also involved in the training of airline staff and immigration officers overseas to spot  documents to stop people from even beginning their journey to the UK.Between April  and December  more than , people were refused entry to the UK, including those refused for travelling on invalid documentation.Steve tweeted KLM airlines asking what they are going to do about the issue after they let Allan travel on his passport.He said: Hey KLM you let my friend travel from Prague to Newcastle on my passport .You shouldnt have let him on the plane.

He added: “I believe that will become the Plan B.”And in a sign of the open revolt the PM faces next week, his boss the Business Secretary Greg Clark declared the failure to rule out no deal as “unacceptable”.He told the conference: “A situation in which our manufacturers don’t have the certainty that they need about the terms under which over two-thirds of our trade will be conducted in less than  days time is unacceptable.“It needs to be brought to a conclusion and without further delay.”Issuing a rallying cry to Tory Remainers, Sir John said at an event at the University of Glasgow last night: “Within a few days, Members of Parliament will make decisions that will determine all our futures.“I believe we have a right to expect them to vote for an outcome that best protects the future welfare and prosperity of our nation – without fear or favour, and without deference to Party allegiance.”Sir John also branded members of the Brexiteer ERG group of Tory MPs “zealots” who are determining Government policy through “intransigence”.He claimed the “extreme” members of the ERG had no affinity to tolerant conservatism.The former PM said: “In Parliament, the European Research Group has become a party within a party, with its own whips, its own funding and its own priorities.“Some of its more extreme members have little or no affinity to moderate, pragmatic and tolerant Conservatism.“The ERG does not represent a majority view but - with a minority Government, as now - can determine policy simply by being intransigent: which is precisely what it is doing.“Some - who can fairly be called zealots - seem incapable of looking beyond the one issue of Europe.“It’s not just that it dominates their thinking - it seems to obsess them.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The pair said their plan was still in the offing. But Mr Hammond said while it was a valuable effort, it could not address the immediate challenge or be accepted now.   He said: “However promising as an alternative arrangement to avoid entering a backstop in the future, it is clear that the EU will not consider replacing the backstop with such an alternative arrangement now, in order to address our immediate challenge,” he told the MakeUK annual dinner. “The details of this initiative are still evolving, and would require signicant changes to EU legislation and customs practices that would need to be negotiated with the EU member states and others who will be affected by them.” It came after the Mail on Sunday reported the Tory Cabinet was told explicitly yesterday that the Malthouse plan was not being presented to the EU this week.Last night EU chiefJean-Claude Juncker said he does not expect a breakthrough in Brexit talks with Theresa May in Brussels today.In a tweet, the European Commission presidents deputy chief spokesperson Mina Andreeva quoted Mr Juncker as saying: I have great respect for Theresa May, for her courage and her assertiveness. We will have friendly talks tomorrow but I dont expect a breakthrough.   The Malthouse plan was dreamed up to avoid the backstop - a clause in the -page Brexit deal which would extend EU customs rules over the UK to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It is split in two: Plan A for leaving with a deal and Plan B for leaving without one. Plan A would keep the existing Withdrawal Agreement but with two big changes - extending a transition period by a year, and changing the backstop into a basic free trade agreement. Plan B would mean the UK paid the money it owes infor a standstill arrangement giving more time to thrash out trade.  Meanwhile Mr Hammond told last nights dinner the “prospect – however small - of leaving without a deal is already too great, and is having very real consequences as you make dficult decisions about managing supply chains, about hiring people, about where and when to invest”. Vowing to ramp up warnings of a no-deal departure, he told guests: “You – and we – need to carry on explaining the implications of a no deal exit, no matter who cries project fear, because it’s our duty to communicate the reality of the situation, to the people we represent.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour plans law oust splitter","story":"NewsLabour plans law to oust MPs who leave party as Joan Ryan quits with Corbyn attackLabour is fighting back after Joan Ryan joined the eight-MP Independent Group - and declared Mr Corbyn is \"not fit\" to lead a party \"completely infected\" with anti-SemitismShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsJoan Ryan - who lost a no confidence vote by her local Labour Party in September - declared Mr Corbyn is not fit to lead a party completely infected with anti-Semitism \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Labour is planning a LAW to oust quitting MPs after Joan Ryan became the eighth to leave the party with a savage attack on Jeremy Corbyn.

I will do all in my power to stop that threat from materialising. Labours remaining centrist MPs have demanded Mr Corbyn - who said he regrets the saga - takes a more conciliatory tone and acts to resolve concerns. But it appears Labour chiefs are turning their attention to the gang of eight MPs - for refusing to fight for a new mandate in a by-election. Jeremy Corbyns allies say the MPs were elected under a Labour banner. So they should resign their seats and re-stand, giving Labour voters a chance to oust them.   Now the party has announced it will consult on a new law that -Mr Corbyn becomes Prime Minister - would give a legal basis to ousting splitter MPs. The party is consulting on extending the right to launch a recall petition which was introduced in . This would force MPs who quit their party they won under, between elections, to re-stand for officeat least % of local voters demand it. Recall petitions are currently mostly used for cases like an MP being convicted of a crime or serious misconduct. So far only one has been used, unsuccessfully against DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr, after he was suspended from the Commons over undeclared trips to Sri Lanka.  A Labour spokesman said: The Labour Party is today announcing that it will consult on extending the right of constituents to petition to recall their MPsthey leave the political party under whose banner they were elected.This consultation will form part of a far-reaching programme of political reform, which, when Labour is in government, will culminate in a Constitutional Convention to radically democratise politics and power in our country.Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: Power comes from the people but for too long the overwhelming majority have been shut out. Thats why trust in politics and in elites is rightly falling. “Communities should not have to wait for up to five years to actthey feel their MP is not properly representing their interests, especially with the restrictions of the Fixed Term Parliament Act. “This proposed reform has the dramatic potential to empower citizens and will be one of many measures the Labour Party is planning to consult on and announce that will change the way politics in this country is done”.

The three MPs are some of the fiercest critics of the Prime Ministers Brexit strategy in the Tories and have each faced abuse for their pro-Remain stance.On Monday seven Labour MPs left the party over Mr Corbyns leadership citing his Brexit stance and failure to tackle anti-Semitism.They were followed on Tuesday evening by Joan Ryan who accused Jeremy Corbyn of “presiding over a culture of antisemitism and hatred of Israel”.In his first public appearance since the initial resignations, the Labour chief offered a conciliatory tone, and said: “I recognise that leading the party means you have to take people with you, and I am determined to do that.” Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell dismissed claims  Labour MPs had been considering a split, but said: “We need to keep listening, bring people in, talk to them.” His party is in turmoil after Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie, Luciana Berger, Angela Smith, Ann Coffey, Gavin Shuker and Mike Gapes quit.The Independent Group is as yet an informal grouping of MPs who will sit on the opposition benches.But, its understood, there are plans to turn it into a proper political party by the end of the year.

The split in  continues to cast a dark shadow over the party. Then, as now, a group of moderate MPs left in protest at the party’s shyleadership, the infiltration by the hard left and isions over Europe. Then, as now, the splitters promised to break the mould by changing the “broken” way of doing politics. In the end they only proved the dficulties of establishing a new political force under our first-past-the-post electoral system. In , the SDP-Liberal Alliance got . million votes, a shade below Labour’s . million, but won  seats to Michael Foot’s . By , the SDP was wound up following the creation of the Liberal Democrats.  Many in Labour fear history could repeat itself with the “gang of seven”. The lesson they draw from the creation of the SDP is that a new party will split the Labour vote and hand the Tories the next general election on a plate. Angela Smith said yesterday that comparisons with the SDP do not “stand up to scrutiny”.  “This is a dferent century and the challenges that the country faces are on a scale that I don’t think we have seen at any other time in the post-war period,” she said. There is no doubt that Brexit is testing traditional political allegiances. Many voters now identy themselves by how they voted in the referendum, rather than by which party they tend to support.  But it is far from certain this upheaval will lead to a redrawing of the political map. Historian Dr Matt Cole, from Birmingham University, said: “The inidual MPs have a steep hill to climb, it is rarely successful. “The culture of British politics is one in which the main political parties, however unpopular they are, nonetheless are incredibly resilient. “They are like a company that nobody likes the products of, but they can’t stop buying them.” The two main parties’ joint vote in  was the highest since , he said. There may be, as Ms Smith said, a large number of people who feel politically homeless. But evenyou provide then with a new house the chances of breaking the two-party monopoly are slim.  Unlike in , the seven dissident MPs cannot claim to be political heavyweights. The founders of the SDP included Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor and Home Secretary, David Owen, a former Foreign shySecretary, and Shirley Williams, a former Education Secretary. The highest rank achieved by Chuka Ummuna was shadow Business Secretary under Ed Miliband. At the moment, the Independent Group lacks all the components required to form a new party – a grassroots base, money and a distinct agenda. The MPs were brutally honest in saying what they were against: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism the hard Left’s grip on the party machine the lukewarm opposition to Brexit.  They were less clear when it came to spelling out what they did stand for. But this does not mean the Labour leadership has nothing to fear from the breakaway. The centrist seven could be joined by other MPs, including Conservatives, and their message may shyresonate with disillusioned Labour councillors, activists and voters. Which is why many expected a stronger response from the Labour leadership to the most serious fracturing of the party in almost  years. It was moment when the party’s MPs and activists looked for reassurance and direction. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a tersely worded statement expressing his disappointment and sent an email to members urging them to stay united.  There should have been, at the very least, an acknowledgement that the criticisms made by the departing seven would have chimed with many Labour MPs and supporters. Those who may still quit need to hear from the Labour leader why they should stay. It was left to Deputy Leader Tom Watson to try to articulate the mood of a dismayed and anxious party. His warning that unless things change others could follow the seven out of the door was a direct challenge to Corbyn. Labour could only prevent others from leaving, Watson said,we “reach out and extend beyond our comfort zone”.  There was also a more veiled message that the leadership needed to listen to the Parliamentary Labour Party on Brexit. It was noticeable that in his email to party members, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed that the option of a second referendum remained on the table. Some believe that unless he follows through on this demand then other MPs could join the nascent Independent Group. How the leadership responds will be a major factor in determining whether the breakaway MPs are a flash in the pan or a new movement. If allies of Corbyn turn viciously on the quitters they will confirm their reasons for leaving and could encourage others to follow.  The leadership must ask itself why moderate MPs feel they can no longer stay in the party and respond to concerns about Brexit and anti-Semitism. At stake is Labour’s chance of winning the next election. In dozens of marginal seats the Independent Group could split the opposition vote and allow the Tories to keep power. The legacy of the SDP was to force Labour to sht to the centre, where elections are usually won or lost. Today’s seven MPs may have decided to sacrice their careers for the same ambition.

Harley Gray, , was taking her kids to the Planet Circus OMG! show when she heard there was a staff shortage and offered to help. She thought she would be selling tickets, but was soon in costume, up against a board, having knives hurled at her by Emil Faltyny. Harley said: “The whole thing was very scary and I had my eyes closed for most of it. “Then, every now and again, I would feel this rush of air fly past me followed by a bang, I am thankful that I wasn’t hit, but the performers are very talented.  “My kids had no idea how scared I was. They loved watching it.” Seventh generation performer Emil admitted he has hit people before, but kept that to himself before Sunday’s act with Harley in Cleethorpes, Lincs. He said: “On Sunday my we Svatava was ill, and I normally throw the knives at her. While I have been training at this act since I was a little boy, there are times I do not hit the target. “Recently, I actually cut the entire nail off my we’s hand when I was throwing the knives in between her fingers. She didn’t talk to me for a few days after that.” Harley said: “I have known the circus manager Jo McMullen for a number of years now, and when I arrived and heard they needed some help because someone was ill, I was happy to offer assistance.   “I thought that I would just be helping to sell tickets or food, I had no idea that I would be actually taking part in the show itself as someone threw knives at me.” Jo said: “We are very grateful that Harley was able to step in. If she had not helped help us, we would have had this huge empty space in the middle of the show.” Harley, who lives in Cleethorpes, said: “I have never done anything like this in my le, and, although it did scare me, I think that I would definitely do it again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad 31 meet newborn baby","story":"NewsDad, , got to meet his newborn baby daughter just three hours before he diedBrett Kinloch died the same day that his we Nicola went into labour with their third daughter after a four-year battle with a brain tumourShareCommentsByEmilia Bruce-Watt:,  FEB NewsBrett Kinloch, , died just hours after the birth of his third daughter \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dying dad has his final wish granted when he met his newborn baby daughter just three hours before he died. Tragic superhero Brett Kinloch, , died the same day that his we Nicola went into labour with their third daughter. He had been fighting a brain tumour for four years. Nicola, her mum Jill, and newborn baby Ariya were on the motorway to see Brett just  minutes after giving birth. The mother-of-three gave birth to their daughter at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Bedfordshire, last Monday and drove  miles to see Brett at Milton Keynes Hospital. Nicola, , said: It sounds horric but it could have been a lot worse - she could have been born  hours later. I take a lot of comfort in the fact he did meet her. I laid her on top of him and she had a cuddle. He could hear what was going on and he knew we were there, Ill always be grateful for that.   Nicola and her daughters - Freya, four, Ella,  months, and newborn Ariya - have been comforted with round-the-clock support from family, friends and the community. The mother-of-three added: I can never thank the NHS enough - the call-out doctor called Tim who kept Brett alive, the paramedics that took him over there - there were nurses from all areas of the hospital that just wanted to do everything they could. The midwives Hayley and Laura at LD Hospitalworked tirelessly and compassionately to get me on the road as soon as possible. There was no-one at the NHS who didnt go above and beyond to help us.   Brett, from Northampton, was a PE teacher and head of department at Cedars Upper School in Leighton Buzzard, Beds. Brett and Nicola met when they began their PE teacher careers at Milton Keynes Academy, Beds., in . The father-of-three learned of his grade  glioblastoma brain tumour four years ago - shortly after the birth of his eldest daughter, Freya. Brett was originally given a prognosis of just  months but Brett battled hard to recover and the family raised money for treatment abroad. But just before Christmas last year, while Nicola was expecting their third child, the couple received the heart-breaking news that Bretts tumour had regrown. The family were told that the tumour was in an area of the brain that was inoperable and Bretts condition deteriorated. Before he died, Brett told his young family that everything is going to be okay - things will be dferent but they will be okay. Nicola said: Brett never never made excuses and he lived le to the full. He was still working three weeks before he died, he wanted to provide for his family. He loved le and he never made excuses, never let [his illness] stop him living. We went on holidays abroad, we took the kids to Disneyland. Even when he could no longer drive, he got a bus pass and would take Freya out. Speaking about her three daughters, Nicola added: Freya is absolutely devastated. We lost my grandmother last year and so she has some understanding of what it is to lose someone. She used to call him her superhero handsome prince and they did everything together - he was such a good dad. A family friend also paid tribute to the fantastic care that Nicola gave to her husband throughout his illness. Nicola said: The offers of help and support from our family, friends and even complete strangers have been so lovely and humbling - I appreciate every one of them. Brain Tumour Research have been thanked for their ongoing support and the family wishes to highlight the charitys Wear a Hat Day on March .An online fundraiser for the Kinloch family has also been set up at www.gofundme support-the-kinloch-family .In just five days, the page has already raised pound, of its pound, goal.

After receiving three messages from the stranger, Mary, who was also married to someone  at the time, responded to let Peter know he must have the wrong number. But their relationship soon blossomed over text messages and the pair confided each about their failing relationships - until Peter travelled from Bolton, Lancashire, to stay with Mary and her then husband.   When Peters we found out about their friendship and Mary eventually split from her own partner, the pair realised that fate had brought them together. Despite the unusual method of meeting and the -year age gap, the couple claim their shared sense of humour ensures they are well matched. Mary, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: It was fate that brought us together. When I first received Peters messages, I just ignored them - I had no idea who they were from. I was receiving messages in the early hours of the morning because Peter worked at a similar time to me and thought he was texting his we. Then one day I had the courage to say Im sorry, but I dont know who you are and he apologised. But we kept in touch on and off about our days after realising we both worked similar hours. We chatted about what was going on in our lives and eventually got round to talking about our relationships at the time.  It turned out Peter was having the same problems in his relationship too and we used each other as a backbone really. After over a year of texting and talking on the phone as just friends, Peter had a blazing row with his we and came to stay with Mary and her then-husband. Mary said: Peter came up for a couple of days after an argument with his we and he stayed at my house with me and my husband. Before he came to Newcastle hed only sent me one photograph of himself and his son at his wedding - thats all Id seen. But I knew he was in need and after talking to my ex-husband, he suggested he came and stayed with us. There was nothing romantic at that point. He tried to get his head together while I just got on with my normal routine. After Peter went back to his hometown of Bolton in March , he left his we a couple of weeks later and went to stay with a friend. In July, Mary left her husband and went to stay with her sister, while Peter decided to move up to Newcastle to be near her - although they insist they were only friends at this point.  It wasnt until later that year that the couples friendship evolved into something more as they helped each other through orces and decided to take a trip to Blackpool. On their , they finally decided to give their relationship a go. Mary said: We didnt decide what was going on until we went to Blackpool just to seewe could work as a couple. At first I thought the age dference would be an issue but it wasnt. We had a lot in common, the same sense of humour and most importantly I trusted him to keep me safe. Its been a lucky escape to a better place. People are always so shocked when we tell them how we met. Theres a girl at work this week who asked Peter - she couldnt believe it. In , after  years together, Mary and Peter finally married at a low-key ceremony surrounded by close friends and family. Mary said: Everything was lovely. I didnt have a new dress - I had a dress that had been made for me previously. Peter had a kilt from his first wedding so we had that all dismantled.   I made the flowers myself and all the button holes for the men. I also made my own wedding cake. Our wedding song goes back to the time we actually met - it was Daniel Bedingfields I Will Never Leave Your Side. Peter, who now works at the same supermarket as Mary in Newcastle, split up with his we after she reportedly became jealous of their friendship. He believes they grew together because of their shared sense of humour and similar experiences. Peter said: Id just bought a new phone so was saving my ex-wes number, but must have typed in the wrong digit. There was one number dferent between my we at the time and Marys numbers. Id sent a few messages and Mary eventually messaged back explaining Id got the wrong number. She explained who she was but I didnt mention it to my we because we were going through a bad patch. From the same day we started talking to each other. It was a case of messaging back and forth then. Eventually, my we found out about Mary but I was still keeping in touch and ringing her. She didnt like that - you can understand why. One day it just got too much and I left. I had to find somewhere to live. I had to sleep on my friends sofas for a couple of months until I could move up to Newcastle. I soon had a job lined up though and in July  I moved up there. I was in the flat for about  months until  when Mary and I got a house together. Weve got the same sense of humour and in the early days we could talk about the things that were going on in our lives. Thats how we grew closer.

The prison holding the British mum, , after she was sentenced to five years for spying has reneged on its promise to allow her important health checks. Bosses are demanding she first writes them a grovelling letter of apology over last month’s protest with fellow political prisoner Narges Mohammadi. Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratclfe said: “They were outraged by the idea they needed to personally apologise to be given health treatment.” Desperate Nazanin forfeited food for three days to demand denied medical care after finding lumps in both breasts, and suffering numbness and pain in her neck, arms and legs.  The pair ended their strike when the jail agreed to check-ups, but weeks later treatment has again been blocked. After the strike, Nazanin was allowed to visit the Iranian government-run Health Commission, where a neurologist suggested she was too ill to be in prison. But although doctors there ordered scans, the prison clinic has blocked them until they receive written apologies from both women. Nazanin’s extra plea to see a psychiatrist has not been met at all. Richard said yesterday: “The neuroshylogist said she clearly had a problem and needed scans. The next day she saw a doctor about the lumps and he said they needed to do scans.  “But the scans got blocked by the head of the clinic in the prison who told them they wouldn’t do anything until she had written a personal apology an apology for the ‘mistakes they made’, meaning the strike. I don’t think he’ll deign to name it.” He added: “The neurologist hit her with a hammer on the knee and there was no reaction at all. She had no grip in her hand as well. He said, ‘why are you even in prison in a condition like this ’” Richard explained the manipulation is all the more sickening because the Iranian ambassador is claiming Nazanin is receiving treatment. Nazanin and Narges have refused to write the letter. But Richard does not believe Nazanin has decided to strike again. “She is very low,” he said. “It’s not an act of defiance for her, it’s an act of despair. It’s more the sense of ‘What more can I do ’ She is really clear she can’t go on much longer.”  Nazanin was arrested at Tehran airport in April  and sentenced to five years on accusations of spying. Iranian prosecutors have told her it is connected to the repayment of a debt owed by Britain to Iran for a cancelled arms deal in the s but neither country has confirmed this. The charity worker, from London, had been visiting her parents on holiday with her daughter Gabriella. Gabriella, now four, lives with her maternal grandparents in Tehran so she can visit. But Richard has been refused a visa and has not seen his daughter or we since they left Britain. Nazanin’s despair increased last week after the th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, a period of clemency when many prisoners were pardoned.  The next opportunity for clemency is the Iranian New Year, on March . Richard said: “I think she will keep going until New Year and then heaven help us what happens afterwards.” This week Gabriella gave a heartbreaking glimpse of le with her “daddy in London” and “mummy in prison”. Richard is keen she begin school in the UK this autumn, but knowing the importance of having her close to Nazanin, he has always told his we this is “her decision”. He fearsshe is not released next month, it will be an even harder one to make. “At the moment we are worrying about bringing them both home in March or dealing with the fallout in April,” Richard says. There is also the fear Gabriella may not be able to come home alone at all. “We have had mixed messages from the Iranian authorities,” he says. “The government insisting there is no impediment at all, and the judiciary saying they won’t let her go until her mother’s release. You can’t tell from rhetoric what will happen.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pizza hut serve meat vegetarian","story":"NewsPizza Hut serves meat to vegetarian in shocking restaurant blunderPizza Hut left Abhishek Bhartiya, of St Anns, Nottingham, furious as beef is forbidden for HindusShareCommentsByHannah MitchellBradley Jolly:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsAbhishek Bhartiya and Prerna Goel told of their experience at a Pizza Hut \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Blundering Pizza Hut served meat to a vegetarian man in a shocking restaurant mix-up.

But she will not be the last Islamic State bride or supporter to prove a headache for the UK Government, experts have warned. Over just seven days, a DOZEN other UK women have descended on displacement camps in the area, BBC News reports. The circumstances surrounding why these women travelled to Syria and how they have ended up at the camps is unclear.  Speaking from the Middle East last night, BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville said: This whole issue of what to do with these IS women and other IS supporters isnt going to go away.We know that in the last week alone,  British women have arrived at displacement camps here in northern Syria. So for the British Government, this headache of what to do doesnt end with Shamima Begum. Begum, from Bethnal Green, east London, is not the first ISIS supporter to have been stripped of their British citizenship. It emerged this week that Home Secretary Sajid Javid had ordered the move against her as the so-called caliphate crumbles. The teenager was among a trio of girls from Bethnal Green Academy who travelled to Syria to support the terror group in February .   She now wants toto the UK with newborn Jarrah - her third child, after she reportedly lost two other children as infants. Her familys lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, has said her relatives are very disappointed over the move to strip her of her citizenship. They are considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision. International law forbids nations from making people stateless by revoking their only citizenship, while Government guidance from  states that the Home Secretary has the power to order the deprivationit would be conducive to the public good, and as long as they are not left without any citizenship. However, Begums lawyer told the Press Association that the teenager - who is of Bangladeshi heritage - was born in the UK, has never had a Bangladeshi passport and is not a dual citizen.   The Home Office said such decisions are not taken lightly and are carried out in order to protect this country. We do not comment on inidual cases, but any decisions to deprive iniduals of their citizenship are based on all available evidence and not taken lightly, a spokesperson said. ITV News reported a letter from the department was received by Begums mother on Tuesday. Please find enclosed papers that relate to a decision taken by the Home Secretary, to deprive your daughter, Shamima Begum, of her British citizenship, the letter read. In light of the circumstances of your daughter, the notice of the Home Secretarys decision has been served of file today , and the order removing her British citizenship has subsequently been made.   The document asked the teenagers mum to inform her daughter of the decision, as well as her right to appeal. Begum, who gave birth to Jarrah on Saturday, has made pleas for forgiveness and to be accepted back in the UK. This week, she compared the Manchester Arena bombing to military strikes on ISIS strongholds, calling the terror attack retaliation. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has signalled she could be arrested and investigatedshe s to Britain. There are currently plans to change the law to make travelling to certain terror hotspots a criminal offence, but this would not apply retrospectively to Begum.

Children as young as eight can take part in the challenge, which launched at Dartmoor Zoo earlier this month. The game sees four people pitted against one of its big cats in an activity zoo keepers have said the animals find enriching. The experience costs pound per person and is set to help create the best welfare possible for the animals.In an advertisement for the experience on the zoos Facebook page, it says that this type of enrichment is very important to keep the cats fit and healthy. Animal rights groups have hit out at the zoo and have said the experience has no respect for the animals, while others branded the organisers as morons. In a tweet to Datmoor Zoo, The Born Free Foundation said: @.DartmoorZoo to offer ‘Human vs Beast Experience’ this February half-term. Is a tug of war game with a lion or tiger really the way to inspire respect for these animals  RT to urge the zoo to rethink this! #DontBuyCaptivity #KeepWildleinTheWild. Other activists said: Is this for real  What moron thought that this was a good idea. Competitors can take on either the zoos male tiger Dragan or its male lion Jasirir.   Meat is attached to a rope to bait the animals and when it picks it up the participants, which are on the other side of the fence, take up the other end of rope for a tug-of-war.Speaking to the Daily Star, senior zoo keeper Simon Moore said this sort of experience is essential for the animals.He said: In captivity, its essential for us to try to mimic the behaviours to create the best welfare possible. We do a lot of enrichment for the cats and this is just one type.   The zoos CEO Benjamin Mee said the activity is common across other zoos and wildle parks and that the lions like it. The public like it and its working well. It is regarded as really good enrichment for the animals, whether the public are involved or not. Social media users also aired their frustration at the activity with one user saying that the zoo was shameful.  Jo Hollis said: Dartmoor zoo should be ashamed of themselves. Please explain how this is conservation allowing people near WILD ANIMALS. Its not! Its a money grabbing scheme at the animals expense.Twitter user @paulwrites said: Are they living in medieval times  Whoever thought of this and backed it should think very carefully about demonising animals as commodities for profit.

Samantha Simpson, , met her husband JR through mutual friends when she was just , and they fell for each other after months of talking. The couples relationship hasnt been entirely smooth as trolls have called her husband a paedophile. Her family didnt accept the age-gap relationship, so Samantha moved into her own apartment in Berryville, Arkansas, US. Retired JR moved in with her before they got their first joint home in Wichita, Kansas, six months ago. The couple quickly got engaged, and married on January ,  after dating for one year. Now theyre trying to start a family of their own.   Student Samantha claims they receive daily abuse from strangers - calling her husband a child snatcher, paedophile and mistaking him for her granddad. Samantha said: When we are out in public, we have strangers mistaking us for granddad and granddaughter all of the time and it can really upset me. But its even worse when people call JR a child snatcher or a paedophile when they see us hold hands or kiss in public. Theres not a moment when we are out and about that someone doesnt make a comment about our relationship, and its just exhausting.   We have had enough of a hard time with family and friends not accepting our relationship, that when strangers do it too it just becomes too much. We just want people to realise that we are happily married and serious about our relationship - and other people shouldnt be discriminating us in such a way. After meeting JR, Samantha claims that she instantly fell for him due to his looks and his gentlemanly manner. She said: When I saw JR I was automatically drawn to how well presented he was and the fact that he was such a gentleman. He was very well spoken whenever we met, and also when we would talk over the phone and text, he was just something I had never found in a man before.   I have dated men who have been closer to my age before, but theyve been very immature and havent known how to treat their partner. Being with JR is completely dferent - hes so mature and treats me like a Queen, theres nothing that I would change about him or our relationship. Despite other peoples opinions on their relationship, the newlyweds are both taking their relationship very seriously and are even trying to have children. Samantha said: Although JR had a child from a previous relationship, we want to have children of our own and start a family.  We are currently trying to get pregnant as we feel the time is right - weve just got married and we have our own place, so why wouldnt we want to  Hopefully when we have a child the abuse will stop, as we dont want to raise a child in an environment where they have to hear nasty slurs about their father. We hope that by sharing the story of our relationship, people will realise that it isnt a joke and we are very serious about one another despite our age gap and appearances.

Finally, we see them – a family of gorillas descended from those David shyAttenborough made famous in . Our hearts hammering in a silence only broken by the buzzing of insects, we watch the Rwanda mountain gorillas as they sit stock still, looming from lush vegetation like sculptures. This is Ururabo, , with her sons, Nkurunziza, five, and Imena, , and in her strong arms daughter Wang Wang Uburumbuke, with a bootbrush head of fuzz, aged just one. Ururabo is the daughter of Poppy, who was just  months old when she was filmed as she watched her pal Pablo playfully sit on an astonished David Attenborough. Later, off camera, mischievous Poppy untied the naturalist’s boots.   In April, it will be  years since the film, in Sir David’s Le on Earth series, was screened on the BBC to an shyaudience who knew more about gorillas from King Kong than wildle shows. Previously, not even the presenter himself had ever met one in the flesh, let alone filmed them. When his encounter with the gorillas was broadcast, the creatures were precariously rare, numbering under  in the world and predicted to be extinct by the end of the century. But there are now more than ,, making mountain gorillas the only ape on the planet, bar humans, rising in number. Although they are still shyendangered, it is an extraordinary conservation success story, in large part thanks to Sir David. We have come to Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park in the Virunga mountains to retrace his steps, and try to understand his achievement and find descendants of the cheeky gorillas he met.   We are here with biologist Ian Redmond, , who, in the s, worked in this dense jungle as a -year-old assistant to primatologist Dian Fossey, who had studied these groups, giving them each names. Ian, who held the microphone as the gorillas gently teased Sir David like a brother, says the film “helped change the fate of a species”. The gorillas were targeted by poachers, who cut off their hands and feet as trophies, and stole their babies to sell. Ian says: “First, Sir David demolished the King Kong myth by being so clearly accepted by the gorillas. He turned people’s opinions of them around. “He never expected to get this close, but they took to him, although he certainly didn’t expect Pablo to sit on him. “There was even a moment, when the lens was being changed, when Poppy’s sister, Puck, took hold of his head and peered right at his face. “When you’re with a family of resting gorillas there is no fear. That’s what people saw and they loved them. “Afterwards, he used his reputation to raise money and get organisations involved.”  The family tree of those gorillas is now long. A census carried out exclusively for the Mirror reveals sisters Poppy, Puck and Tuck, the female gorillas in Attenborough’s film, have  children,  grandchildren, and one great-grandchild between them. Our aim was to meet some of the youngest starlet Poppy’s brood. Until last year, she was a regular face in the forest, at the age of  the last of the bunch alive. Then she went missing, thought to have died from natural causes. As we watch, her daughter Ururabo’s family begin to move about. Imena’s awesome hands, fingers like bananas, encircle crackling shoots as Ururabo strides gracefully through the butterflies with her baby on her back. Later, crawling on our knees through goose grass and wild celery, we find silverback Agahebuzo, the strapping, -year-old grandson of Tuck. As he sinks back for a snooze, he raises his leg and clutches it with his plate-sized hand, ashe’s doing yoga. It is hard to believe anyone could knowingly hurt these serene beings, who share % of human DNA.  As Sir David said: “There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal I know.” After a little fearfully catching Agahebuzo’s knowing brown eyes, the same colour as my own, I understand. But in the s, they were prey. Just before Sir David arrived, a male christened Digit was speared to death, his hands and feet hacked off by poachers. Ian says: “Two days later that’s how I found him. When Sir David arrived, we were angry and grieving.” Six months after he left, a male and female were shot dead, and their baby, Kweli, who also appeared in the documentary, was left an orphan. He later died. Ian says: “He lost the will to live.” Chief warden Prosper Uwingeli says the authorities needed to recognise the gorillas as a treasure in order to protect them. After Sir David finished filming, he and the crew were shot at and strip-searched as they made their way down the mountain, the army suspicious they were trying to highlight poaching.  When they realised they had simply highlighted the beauty of these incredible creatures, their attitude changed. Prosper says: “Attenborough’s message changed minds. We feel grateful to him.” Later that year, the first habituated gorilla group for structured tourist visits was created. In , full-time veterinary care was shyestablished and today Gorilla Doctors operate in the forest, which also spans neighbouring Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, checking for le-threatening wounds and diseases. Prosper says: “Some don’t see tourism as a form of conservation, but it is low-intensity, kept to one visit a day, for an hour only. It is working.” Despite their familiarity with human faces, there is no doubt that the gorillas are wild. We encounter Poppy’s daughter feeding her baby and the surprise elicits a hissing roar which forces us all to crouch into submissive poses.  Direct poaching has ceased in Rwanda and Uganda. But in the politically unstable DRC, gorillas are harder to protect and apes are still poached. The latest positive phase in the gorilla’s protection is the Rwandan government’s decision last year to expand the forest, adding almost , hectares to its current ,. I’m assured residents farming there will be re-homed, and given new means to earn a better living. This must happen but, ultimately, forest expansion is for everyone’s sake. The huge amount of carbon dioxide which forests absorb is crucial to battling climate change.

John Allen Chau was  when he ventured onto North Sentinel Island last year in a bid to spread his faith among the Sentinelese - the worlds last untouched community. Illegally taken there by fishermen, he was killed in a bow and arrow attack soon after arriving on the island, and buried in the sand the morning after. In his final message to his family, the Christian missionary wrote: You guys might think I am crazy in all this but I think its worth it to declare Jesus to these people. This is not a pointless thing - the eternal lives of this tribe is at hand and I cant wait to see them around the throne of God worshipping in their own language as Revelation :- states.Now Faithwire reports the Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom Sam Brownback has confirmed the US will not be taking the case further. On February , he told a press conference: The US government has not asked or pursued any sort of sanctions that the Indian government would take against the tribal people in this case. Thats not been something that we have requested or have put forward. Its a tragic situation and a tragic case of whats happened, but thats not something thats been asked. Last week, Mr Chaus dad spoke out, blaming extreme Christianity for his sons death. If you havepositive to say about religion, l wish not to see or hear, Dr Patrick Chau told . Indian authorities said days after the November  killing that they had no plans to retrieve the -year-olds body. It was feared their presence could antagonise the tribe further, with the Sentinielese having always resisted the presence of outsiders.  On November , Mr Chau attempted his first visit to the island by a boat that took him around – metres from the shore. Fishermen warned him not to go any further, but he continued alone in a canoe with a Bible to the shore. As he approached the island, he saw the islanders and attempted to communicate with them, shouting: My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you. He later recorded in his journal that he had greeted them and attempted to offer gts, but they continued to approach him and he hurriedly retreated in his canoe. On further visits, Mr Chau recorded the islanders reacted to him with a mixture of amusement, bewilderment and hostility. He attempted to sing worship songs to them, and spoke to them in Xhosa, after which they often fell silent, while other attempts to communicate ended with them bursting into laughter. He recorded that they communicated with lots of high pitched sounds and gestures.  Eventually, when he tried to hand over fish and gts, a boy shot a metal-headed arrow that pierced the Bible Mr Chau was holding in front of his chest, and he left the island. On his final visit, on November , Mr Chau instructed the fishermen to leave without him. The fishermen later saw the islanders dragging Mr Chaus body, and the next day they saw his body on the shore. The Washington Post obtained Mr Chaus journal, which stated that he had a clear desire to convert the tribe and was aware of the risk of death he faced and of the illegality of his visits to the island. He wrote: Lord, is this island Satans last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name   Police subsequently arrested seven fishermen for assisting Mr Chau to get close to the restricted island. Human rights group Survival International said it was possible the American had infected the tribe with pathogens to which they have no immunity, with the potential to wipe out the entire tribe. Indian officials made several attempts to recover Mr Chaus body, but on November  decided to abandon those efforts. An anthropologist involved in the case toldthat the risk of a dangerous clash between investigators and the islanders was too great to justy any further attempts.

It was a great opportunity and things like that are really pleasing.”AndJim was disappointed his players had to fight back from going a goal down after Livi had been reduced to  men, he was pleased with the resilience they showed.“The key message at half-time was don’t panic, keep trying to move the ball because we’ve got  minutes to turn this around.“Don’t try to do it in the first five minutes, keep moving the ball and use the man advantage, try to stretch them.“We went to Easter Road and were two goals down and came back, so there is that bit of steeliness in the team.“It’s not going to happen every week, you’ve got to go and earn it, go and demand it.“And we’d prefer not to go behind.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united build momentum in quest to rejoin scottish top flight","story":"Post-transfer window Dundee United feel they’re beginning to build momentum in their quest for ato the top flight after three wins from three.After a hard-fought - win at Queen of the South, Robbie Neilson’s men have put themselves in a good position within touching distance of the top two, Ayr and Ross County.This, though, has been the time of the season when the Tangerines’ promotion attempt goes pear-shaped and form tumbles in the last two campaigns.This Saturday sees current boss Robbie Neilson up against a man who knows that only too well.Falkirk gaffer Ray McKinnon saw his United team in  falter around this time, allowing Hibs to run away with the title, before running out of gas in the play-off final.Robbie’s task is to avoid a repeat of that – with predecessor Csaba Laszlo also suffering a similar downturn in fortunes – by keeping their momentum going.It won’t be easy against McKinnon’s new side with the recent ‘Rayvolution’ of Falkirk’s squad seeing them become one of the form teams in the Championship after picking up  points from the last  available.So where will the game be won and lost for the current United gaffer and one of his predecessors Calum Butcher v Paul PatonWhere  to start but what promises to be one of the tastiest battles of the day.Former midfield partners Butcher and Paton, neither shrinking violets by any stretch, are set to face off for the first time since playing together under Jackie McNamara – should Butcherafter his suspension.Paton has been a key figure at Falkirk, helping them rise from the relegation spots in recent weeks.Expect no quarter given by either.Peter Pawlett v Paul DixonAnother former United man Dixon is in the Bairns’ ranks after signing in January.He’s likely to come up against United dangerman Pawlett at some point, eventhe forward doesn’t start on the right as he’s known to drt.‘Dicker’ is yet to taste defeat in his five matches at Falkirk while Pawlett has three wins from three in Tangerine – one of those records will end this Saturday.Ian Harkes v Ian McShaneThe battle of the Ians could be an intriguing one in midfield.American Harkes has quickly become a fans’ favourite at Tannadice and has shown experience beyond his years in his short time at the club.Like Harkes, McShane is a technical player who can provide quality on the ball.Whoever comes out on top will go a long way to getting a vital result for their team.Freddy Frans v Zak RuddenThe articial pitch at Falkirk may well see Mark Reynolds again miss out due to his injury history while Mark Connolly is also fighting an injury problem.Frans, meanwhile, stepped in at Queen of the South and put on a Man-of-the-Match performance in central defence.He’ll have to be on his game again, alongside Rachid Bouhenna, to keep Falkirk dangerman Rudden quiet.The on-loan Rangers striker has scored nine in  for the Bairns this season, with three in his last five.Nicky Clark v Falkirk defenceClark is United’s form man at the moment with goals in his last two outings winning both games at St Mirren and Queen of the South.He’s looking match sharp for the first time in Tangerine and the Falkirk backline will have to be wary.On loan William Edjenguele can’t play against his parent side so whoever comes in will have their hands full with the speedy striker."},{"url":null,"title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days. He’s a god down there.”United have their own in-form attacker in the shape of Pavol Safranko.The Slovakian, who’s on loan from Aalborg, has hit the net three times in his last four games.That’s taken his tally so far to  goals and he’s scored on the two previous occasions he’s faced the Doonhamers.“We been playing well and we’re looking for that to continue,” added Robbie."},{"url":null,"title":"three strikers almost missed dees win against livingston","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre has revealed he was close to being without his entire strikeforce for Saturday’s vital win at Livingston.The Dark Blues picked up three points to move out of the bottom two in the Premiership for the first time since August and main strikers Andrew Nelson, Craig Curran and Kenny Miller all played their part.However, it wasn’t until late on Friday the manager was sure they would be available.“Nelson had not trained all week. He took a bang on the shinand it went into his calf,” said Jim.“The swelling was in a deep compartment and we couldn’t sht it so he was a major doubt. The first day he trained was Friday.“Kenny Miller missed two days with illness and Craig Curran was on the treatment table most of the week, as was Ethan Robson.“It wasn’t looking great in terms of having to pick the same team again. I’m delighted they all pulled through and I thought we deserved the victory.”Nelson did have to come off immediately after scoring a second-half equaliser when his leg seized up but he is expected to make Friday night’s clash with Hibs at Dens Park.That game will represent a chance to move three points ahead of second-bottom Hamilton and stretch the gap to basement boys St Mirren to eight points.Right now, Dundee are ahead of Accies on goal dference but, for Jim, it’s not where they are right now that counts.“It’s nice but it doesn’t matter, as long as we are out the bottom two in May. There’s going to be ups and downs, I’ve said that before.“The three teams are all battling.

to be done to bring roads in Inverness up to a standard that makes them safe and easy for road users to navigate, a leading cycling campaigner has said.Brian MacKenzie, convener of the Highland Cycle Campaign, said: ldquoI cycle a lot and there is no doubt the roads in the town are in very poor condition.ldquoThe trunk roads, too, need attention.Championing the cause for better and safer routes for cyclists he said drivers also need to be aware of cyclists and give greater consideration to them.ldquoDrivers often criticise cyclists when they see them weaving along certain routes but often they are doing that simply to avoid potholes and are taking evasive action, he said.ldquoAt the Raigmore Interchange, on the ramp joining the A south from the A, there is a pothole which has been there for some time. It is now gathering water and there is a warning sign for traffic alerting them to flooding.ldquoThere are also two more long potholes which are much more dangerous for cyclists and motorists just as you enter the interchange off the northbound ramp, coming from the Beechwood direction of the A.ldquoThe seal between the interchange and the ramp has gone andyou are cycling along there on a dark night you canrsquot see it, so your wheel can get caught up in it. These are like tram lines and they could throw you off a bike and cause serious injury.ldquoEvery vehicle coming from the A has to go across these potholes as they enter the interchange as well and they have been like that for a considerable time.ldquoI am wondering when the trunk roads people are going to carry out these repairs.While Highland Council is responsible for the upkeep of most roads in Inverness and the surrounding towns and villages, Bear Scotland is responsible for trunk roads.A spokesman for the organisation told the Courier last week that major defects, including deeppotholes which could pose a danger to road users, are repaired within  days, with safety inspections of all roads under its care inspected on a weekly basis.Wednesday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/5c63e816d777e2.10198285.jpg ","title":"signs good for pauls return","story":"Aberdeen#s Paul Lawrie says the “signs are good” ahead of histo Tour action.Lawrie, , will play the Oman Open next week, before the Qatar Masters –starting March  – after recovering from foot surgery.The  Open champion at Carnoustie, Lawrie ended his  season early to finally have a problem taken care of which developed before Europe’s miraculous Ryder Cup victory at Medinah in .“Chippy”, as he is affectionately known because of his watertight short-game, said: “We’ve booked our flights and hotel for Oman and Qatar, so I’m on my way.“I’ve only played two  holes – two full rounds since surgery.“So I thought Oman and Qatar being out there and a little bit warmer would help me see where I am, where my game is and whether I can crack on and play or not.“The signs are good, my foot’s been brilliant. My back’s not been %, but you’d expect that from such a long lay-off.“I’ve not played on the Tour properly since April.”Lawrie, who yesterday announced his new charity Pro-Am event to be held at Gleneagles on July , has spoken often of how a problem which started as an uncontrollable tapping of his left foot when he played developed into the foot collapsing every time he swung the club.However, the now Senior Tour-eligible player, revealed how a chance encounter finally got to the root of the issue.Lawrie said: “I was in Lundin Links’ clubhouse after I’d announced I wasn’t going to play again the rest of the year and Stuart Barton, a physio, was behind me in the queue.“He said: ‘I’m really sorry to hear. I know you’ve had lots of people having a look at it, but I’ve got a practice just up the road, I’d love to have a look.’“He asked me to walk up and down and straight away he said: ‘you’ve got a ruptured tendon and problem with the ligament in your foot, that’s why it’s collapsing when you swing.’“He contacted Gordon Mackay, who’s one of his best mates.“I was in Munich and everywhere trying to get my foot fixed and Stuart noticed it straight away.“I’d never met him before.“But I’ve been rehabbing with him the whole way through. He’s phenomenal at his job, just phenomenal.”Mackay performed Lawrie’s surgery in September and the golfer says the medic is delighted with his progress.He said: “He’s extremely happy.“I think it’s taken a bit longer than he thought to recover.“I probably started hitting balls a bit early.“It was quite a big op he did and a big scar on my foot.“I had a ruptured tendon, torn ligament and some bone spurs on it.“You just assume nowadays itis going to be keyhole or whatever.“You’re looking at  or  weeks, but for me it’s been a bit longer.”Lawrie is now painkiller free while playing for the first time in “six or seven years”.He said his foot felt “really strong” while playing at Montrose in the North-east Alliance last week.In his time off he’s had plenty to smile about, with long-time Paul Lawrie Foundation player David Law winning on the European Tour for the first time – at the ISPS Handa Vic Open in Australia – after only five starts.Lawrie, who thinks Law’s biggest asset is the unteachable ability to win coming down the stretch when he’s got the chance, said: “He came in on Monday with his little girl – and I met him when he was a little boy.“I’m chuffed for him, and you can see from the reaction to his win what a popular guy and nice boy he is.“I’ve not seen a reaction like that for a long time.“He’d be the first to admit it happened quicker than he would’ve thought – he’s only played five events as a full cardholder.“It’s up to him , but he’s obviously going to get a lot of confidence from that.“We had our chat this week.“He’s got to knuckle down pretty quickly and get back on the range, get back on the chipping green.“He’ll have spells coming up where he doesn’t play his best and he’s got to dig in.”Lawrie is also pleased with how another protege, Sam Locke, has adjusted to pro le after winning the Silver Medal for top amateur at Carnoustie last summer, revealing he’s had chats with the -year-old about the importance of getting the ball in the hole above all  at this level.The Farmfoods Paul Lawrie Invitational at Gleneagles will see groups of one Tour pro, one celebrity and two amateurs tee it up for charities, including Lawrie’s foundation, the Doddie Weir Foundation and Beatson.Taking place on the Monday between the Scottish Open at the Renaissance Club and Open at Royal Portrush, Lawrie hopes the event will prove popular.His annual challenge match in the north-east will be unaffected, with Women’s Open winner Catriona Matthew this year’s opponent.Lawrie said: “We also have the Paul Lawrie Challenge Match at the golf centre – that’s still going to go ahead.“I’m playing Catriona Matthew this year, so I better get practising.“That’s on July  at the golf centre.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/5c6444059b45f4.11920662-e1550075195884-539x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet alice amanda jester and ginger are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Cute pair Alice and Amanda are five and six years old, and are miniature schnauzers.They will be looking for their forever home together and it will need to be a quiet, relaxing one.These two love their food so plenty of treats are a must!They are not suitable to be homed around children or cats, but have been around other dogs previously.This handsome collie is still a young boy at three or four years old.He is an energetic lad who will need an active home to keep him stimulated.Jester is friendly with lots of love to give – he adores meeting new people and will make a great addition to any family.He has been around other dogs and children previously, but is not used to cats.This shy boy is four years old and will need a quiet home where he can relax into his new surroundings.He is not used to other animals or children, but will make a great companion for someone on their own.He has a gorgeous long-haired coat which will need regular grooming to keep him looking his best.Ginger is a pampered puss who will need to be kept indoors.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide.

But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Bus firm Stagecoach had followed up on a request to carry out a site visit for a proposed stop at Hollybush Inn after a bus user called for improvement last year. Stranded Suzanne Anderson, , hit out at Stagecoach bosses in December after she was left walking along a dangerous road when a driver failed to stop at Hollybush Inn. Suzanne, of Patna, insisted the stop had always been a ‘traditional unofficial stop’ but the bus firm confirmed this was not the case- nor had it been for ‘many years’. She appealed to Stagecoach to implement an official stop after she left to walk along the busy  mph zone A to the next bus stop. Suzanne previously told the Post: “It’s always been a traditional unofficial stop. “I then had to walk along a dangerous road to another stop to catch a bus.   “They come flying along that road at some speed. Prevention is better than a cure. If that happens to someone  and they had to walk along the road and a lorry comes thundering down- who knows what could happen.” Despite Stagecoach stating Hollybush Inn is not a registered stop, the firm raised the request to install an official one with transport agency SPT. And with checks carried out, the unanimous decision was that the location is unsuitable for an official stop. A Stagecoach West Scotland spokensman said: “Following on from the information provided by the Ayrshire Post on December  in relation to a customer trying to board one of our services at the Hollybush Inn, we can advise that a site visit has been carried out by representatives of SPTand East Ayrshire Council. “It has been agreed that the suggested location is unsuitable for bus stops, due to road safety concerns and the lack of suitable footways.

The shocking evidence makes a mockery of the new flagship South Ayrshire Council recycling policy, which has cost a fortune in public cash. The bin team were filmed as they uplted four giant refuse containers and put them all in the same wagon. The pair of hi-vis clad refusemen did not appear to care who was watching as all the waste was dumped into the back of their lorry, driven by a third council staffer. They were recorded on video for four minutes after they arrived at the bin corral in Ayr’s Newmarket Street.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lawyer-for-ex-nissan-boss-ghosn-questions-handling-of-case","story":"The newly appointed lawyer for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has said he believes the case against his client does ldquonot meet international standards and could scare international businesses away from Japan.Junichiro Hironaka, who was appointed as part of Ghosnrsquos defence team last week, also said he believes his trial might not get under way until after the summer.That could mean months more of detention for the Brazilian-born French car industry veteran, who has twice sought and failed to gain release on bail after his November  arrest.Mr Hironaka said his gut feeling is that Ghosn, the former head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors alliance, is innocent of all charges against him.In court and in interviews, Ghosn has insisted he is innocent and said he wants to fight the case in court.The lawyer questioned why Nissan chose to seek Ghosnrsquos arrest.Junichiro Hironaka ldquoI also found it bizarre why this became a case to start with.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"all welcome as road safety event revs up","story":"It will have its free Campbeltown debut at .pm on Tuesday March  in the Grammar School atrium.Youth engagement officer, PC Karen Cairns said: #This initiative is aimed at all drivers, young and old and particularly those in a hurry.#The play aims to show the effects of careless driving, the consequences on the victim and families and surrounding communities.#This initiative is also to raise awareness of health implications that can impact on ones ability to drive for instance eyesight, hearing and mobility issues.#The police traffic department will have a discussion , with the audience, after the show and highlight ious risks with dferent issues.The free event is expected to last an hour.Campbeltown traffic police checking vehicle speeds on the A in November last year. _ctrafficpolice"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves. Andrew Neil and John Humphrys are part of the problem - and the Beeb is better off without them."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9449373.jpg?type=article-full","title":"former-council-boss-derek-hatton-brands-seven-mps-who-left-labour-pathetic","story":"Speaking after it was reported he had formally been readmitted to the Labour Party  years after being expelled, Mr Hatton told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"Of course its good to be back, in fact in a way Ive never left.:Who are the seven MPs who have resigned from Labour \"For  years Ive stayed absolutely solid with the Labour Party.

Dot, one of Dr Leggrsquos oldest friends, was due to read at the service but she was out of sorts. \"I can barely get a cuppa tea down her\", said Sonia, which in EastEnders is the equivalent of a hospital code blue.Just as Dr Leggrsquos soap le was being brought to a close another was starting, with the arrival of Masoodrsquos sparky nieces. They asked someone what time the restaurant opened. Sorry, havenrsquot been here for years, said a smartly dressed lady with a peroxide pixie crop. Mary!Mary had a grown up daughter with her , as did Sonia. Must have been a BOGOF offer at the Minute Mart.Next old face to turn up was Lofty who now owns  pubs. \"All well away from here,\" he tells Sharon. Well, obviously. Dangerous game running a pub in those parts. He asks after his ex, Michelle, who is off travelling. In reality, Michelle, played by Susan Tully, became a successful director and producer. Since wersquore catching up, Tom Wattmakes films for BT Sport, and ghost-wrote David Beckhamrsquos autobiography, while Linda Davidsonis something big in on-line ops.Down the Queen Vic after the service, Mary had a dig at Dot for calling her parents and telling them to take baby Annie away. Dot reminded Mary that she also told her to steer clear of Pat, who wanted to put Mary on the game. Pat as a madam. It was a reminder of how dark EastEnders once was, albeit in a grim down south, Loachian way. These days it too often plumps for sensationalism, and is much less effective.Cathy lightened the mood by reminding everyone of the hilarious time Dr Legg caught Loursquos bedcover in his bag and walked off, trailing it behind him. Sadly, that is what passes as comedy in EastEnders.The half hour almost up, Lofty gave Martin a cheque for lsquoChellersquos daughter, Vicky, the one he thought was his but was really Dirty Denrsquos .

EU leaders look on aghast as Mrs May continues her forlorn ring-round to get unlikely changes to the Northern Ireland backstop.Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn resists either backing Mrs Mayrsquos deal or supporting the Peoplersquos Vote that Labour voters and members want. A left-wing, pro-EU  could potentially garner big support in the polls, but Mr Corybn puts ideology ahead of political gains.Damaging uncertainty reigns with all outcomes still possible on Brexit: a no-deal chaotic Brexit, Mrs Mayrsquos hard but unclear Brexit, a compromise May-Corbyn Brexit , an extension to Article  or no Brexit at all.There is a triple stand-off going on, amidst this dishonest political posturing, between the executive, the legislature and the people. Theresa May looks powerless but is still standing despite the Commons rejecting her deal by  votes, her then backing the Brady amendment against her own deal , then losing again last Thursday by  votes as the hard Brexiters feared she was backing the Commons rejection of no deal.Yet Mrs May keeps running down the clock, desperately searching for a majority to carry the UK over the Brexit line. Mr Corbyn provides no serious opposition. Various smaller groupings in the Commons attempt to stop her while disagreeing on what should happenthey succeed. Government, opposition and the legislature as a whole are in the midst of a damaging breakdown.Meanwhile, the much-hyped ldquopeople are essentially ignored. The trope that the Commons is pro-Remain, reluctant to implement the ldquowill of the people, is simply wrong. There is a Remain majority across the UK , even in England. Yet the two main political parties, and most of their MPs, keep supporting Brexit but with no consensus still on what Brexit actually means.This is a deep democratic and political failure. Brexit is damaging our economy, our devolution settlement, our security and has trashed the UKrsquos international reputation. And yet the views of the - per cent of the public who now support Remain are not represented at this critical moment by the UKrsquos two main parties. In Scotland ndash and in the Commons ndash the SNP and the LibDems support Remain and another vote but, so far, to little effect, even with the support of Labour and Tory rebels. And Mrs Mayrsquos government has been shockingly ready to let Northern Irelandrsquos lack of executive and assembly drag on.Hoping to stop a no-deal Brexit, Yvette Cooper is putting forward a cross-party amendment next week to demand an Article  delay. She doesnrsquot say how long or what for ndash both things the EU will surely demand to know since they must agree any delay unanimously. But her amendment must lack clarity to have a chance of passing.Another amendment from Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson suggests the Commons back Mrs Mayrsquos deal on the condition of another referendum. Itrsquos a rather tawdry politics that needs MPs to vote for something they oppose to get something, a Peoplersquos Vote, they could just vote directly for.If Ms Cooper succeeds, Mrs May would have to pass her deal by mid-March or request an Article  extension rather than chasing a reckless las- minute Commons vote after the EUrsquos March  summit. Yet, whether in mid- or end-March, the EU could reject delay, or set unpalatable conditions. Or the EU might tell the UK to go away for a year and sort out its political breakdown .Read more: Brexit Day still March  insists GovernmentMeanwhile, dferent groups that oppose Brexit still play into Mrs Mayrsquos timetable. The Peoplersquos Vote campaign have called for a big demonstration on March  which only makes senseBrexit decisions are dangerously delayed until three days before Brexit.Nicola Sturgeon too keeps delaying any decision on another independence referendum. She is waiting for a clear Brexit outcome, something our failing politics looks unlikely to deliver. A chaotic no-deal or a fudged delay will not clary the options for future UK-Scotland relations but either may sharply intensy the independence debate. The Scottish Government must either take a decision amidst uncertainty or embrace the politics of delay too.Brexit shows clearly that the UKrsquos politics is broken and desperately needs modernising. A written constitution and proportional representation for Westminster voting would be a good start. The two big parties need to splitand England has work to do on its own identity and regional politics.And the UK should step back from Brexit so it can start to mend its politics without its economy, security and reputation going down the drain in parallel. Amidst such political and constitutional renewal, the UK could exploretherersquos a new federal model that could work while offering Scotland the chance to decideit wants to break away or be part of that renewal ndash and letting Northern Ireland,it wants, hold a border poll.Yet listing these basic modernisation steps underlines how unlikely they are and how far UK politics is from rescuing itself. Brexit is not the only cause of the UKrsquos political implosion but itrsquos the main immediate trigger. And careering towards a damaging, possibly no-deal Brexit will only intensy that political collapse.Brexit might yet be halted, whether through revoking Article  or holding a successful Peoplersquos Vote. If so, the long, hard work of political renewal could possibly begin. But it wonrsquot be quick or easy.Five weeks before the Brexit deadline, the UK is dependent on its powerless Government and a ided Westminster to rescue itself from this ever deeper crisis. It might happen.

single market rules until a wider trade deal is agreed, in order to prevent the need for checkpoints on the Irish border.The Malthouse plan would replace these arrangements with technological methods for tracking cross-border movements, along with a free trade agreement-lite for Northern Ireland.If this was not acceptable to Brussels, a Plan B would see the UK leave without a deal but with a

alternative arrangements - especially how they might be developed to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland on a permanent footing, avoiding the need for the backstop to ever enter

The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

Accessible and affordable transport is a leline for many rural residents, connecting people to opportunities for socialising, working, learning and healthcare. The research in Inverurie will seek to understand the needs of the community in a rural Scottish location, including residents and local businesses and see how current transport services are meeting those needs.Findings will be used to develop and design new services that can be trialled in rural areas.Jenny Milne, from JLM said: “This project provides a great opportunity to understand the challenges travelling to, in and around Inverurie. By working with the community, it will help to understand what transport services are needed, and what steps can then be taken to improve existing routes around the town. “The project also hopes to engage the villages around Inverurie.“By using focus groups and asking the local community about their ideas, it will help to shape rural transport to the benefit of those living in the area.”The project also has support from Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon: “I would urge local residents and businesses in the Inverurie area to take part in this project and make their views known.“Many people depend upon public transport in rural areas – to get to work, to socialise or to keep appointments at local GP and dental surgeries.“We are fortunate in Inverurie to have a train station connecting the town with Aberdeen and Inverness and there has recently been major investment in the line. “However, in more remote parts of Aberdeenshire, public transport is less reliable and frequent.

This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Not just in the services they provide, but, as one of the biggest employers in Highland, council jobs are fundamental to the sustainability of many communities. So a budget for jobs is really good news for people.ldquoA key element of the feedback we received is that we have many cumbersome, complicated and bureaucratic processes.

Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future. We need to embed effective performance management and effective scrutiny.ldquoThe Corporate Plan will be coming to council in March and this will focus on scrutiny and driving performance.

It was part of a formal trade mission to Paris.The UK’s approach to Brexit came under fire from the SNP leader, who stepped up calls for a change in approach from Theresa May as the prospect of a no-deal exit intensies.Ms Sturgeon says she will seek to hold second referendum on independence in response to Brexit and will set out her approach in coming weeks.She told delegates yesterday: “When we have greater clarity about the terms of Brexit, Scotland must have the option to choose a dferent course by opting to become an independent country.“I will say more about independence at a future date.“One thing I do want to stress, however, is that, for the Scottish Government, independence is not about the isolationism that characterises Brexit. Instead independence would see us recognising and embracing our interdependence with other nations.“We will always seek to be close allies and partners with our neighbours in Europe.“The last two years, to my mind, have underlined the importance of that position.”Ms Sturgeon has indicated recently that a referendum on independence could be several years away and called for “calm consideration” in the face of growing pressure from leading Nationalists to capitalise on the chaos of Brexit currently engulfing Westminster politics.Ex-First Minister Alex Salmond, along with senior SNP MPs Joanna Cherry and Angus MacNeil, are among those who back a more pro-active approach on the issue.A majority of Scotsvoted remain in the EU referendum and an independent Scotland would seek to rejoin the EU.The First Minister said such international institutions have “brought signicant and lasting benefits to Europe and to the world as a whole”. She said: “We are being reminded at the moment that the principles that they exemply – multilateralism, co-operation, a respect for human rights – cannot be taken for granted.“We hear too many voices of intolerance and isolationism around the world today. That should concern all of us.“And so participating in international institutions, and speaking up for internationalist values, is hugely important.” Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal would be “damaging” to Scotland’s interests, the First Minister said.The Prime Minister must face down her Brexiteer wing, Ms Sturgeon added, and push for a deal that keeps the UK in the customs union and single markets – or agree to a second referendum on EU membership.“There is a strong democratic case for that,” Ms Sturgeon said.“For Parliament, it is a way to break the deadlock.For Scotland, it is an opportunity for our wish to stay in the EU to be respected.“And for all voters, it is a chance to make a decision based on much more detailed information than was ever made available in .”Ms Sturgeon said at the time of the referendum, the EU had served as a scapegoat for wider concerns such as austerity.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PORTREE-BRAES-TRUST-FIONA-AND-SOPHIE-2.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year.

It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

James is  years old and is a professional cookery apprentice at the Galgorm Resort  Spa Hotel and Northern Regional College. James was studying for his A-Levels in Nutrition and Food Science, Le and Health Sciences and Applied ITC at Cambridge House Grammar School when he had the opportunity to take up work experience in Antrim’s Ramble Inn. For James – who had always dreamed of being a chef – his time in the Inn’s kitchens led to the realisation that his passion could be his full-time career. When he found out about the apprenticeships with Northern Regional College and the Galgorm Resort  Spa, he jumped at the chance. He said: “I love the creativity that comes with being a chef, you get to make people happy with your food.“So when I was given the chance to learn more and get hands-on experience in the kitchens of one of the biggest players in Northern Ireland’s hospitality sector I just couldn’t pass up that opportunity. It was a no-brainer for me!”James decided to leave school after his AS-Levels and hasn’t looked back since: “I really enjoyed school and I had thought that afterwards I would maybe go on to catering college. However, this apprenticeship is a chance to get experience in the industry and offers me an immediate route into the career I love – why would I put that off for another year ” What does a typical day at the work look like for James  At the moment, he has an enviable position looking after the restaurant’s delectable range of desserts. This means weighing out and prepping ingredients, plating up panna cotta, sticky toffee pudding and cheesecake and making sure the Galgorm’s fridges never run low of sweet treats. If you’re lucky enough to be on campus on a Wednesday, you might even get to sample some of James’ cooking. He and his colleagues spend their morning whipping up meals and being assessed on their abilities. Their top-class cooking is served up to hungry staff and students in the canteen. The afternoon is spent familiarising themselves with the extensive health and safety rules which every chef must know. When asked why he chose the apprenticeship route James says that for him it was the obvious choice: “With the apprenticeship you get to earn while you learn, and you have no student loans to worry about paying back at the end.”But most importantly, it’s the hands-on experience he has received throughout his training which James claims is most valuable.“You can read in a text-book that a professional kitchen is a high-pressure environment, but unless you’ve been in there at peak dinner-serving time, you can’t truly understand it.” James says he would “most definitely” recommend the apprenticeship scheme to someone : “If you want to go into the hospitality sector, I honestly think it’s the smartest career move you can make.” And his advice to them  “Just go for it! You have nothing to lose and so much to gain!”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

When we go back and look at the stats, those are the things we will be saying.#It was a slow start to this game with both teams hitting early wides, but the pattern was soon established with James McNaughton and Alan Devine trading frees before Aonghus Clarke fired over from range.Three McNaughton frees gave Antrim the edge as he then traded points with Devine before Nigel Elliott finally shot Antrim#s first from play on  minutes to make it - to -, but this was to be their final score of the opening half.Westmeath drew level thanks to a Devine free and a magnicent sideline cut from Derek McNicholas before Devine gave them the lead.It was to get even better for the visitors on  minutes as Devine got a touch to Robbie Greville#s long delivery to find the net, while McNicholas and Devine added points to make it - to - at the break.With the swirling wind at their backs in the second period, Antrim needed a bright start and they got it with McNaughton clipping over a free and then Nigel Elliott sent Keelan Molloy in to flick to the net.McNaughton and Kevin Rice added points but, crucially, Antrim could never get ahead.The visitors rallied with the next three points and this was a lead they were to hold for the majority of the second period as the teams effectively went score-for-score.Antrim did get to within one with Conor McCann – who had what looked like a good shout for a penalty waved away when hauled back by Tommy Doyle late on – and McNaughton hitting scores. But McNicholas – who earlier clipped over another sideline – landed a monster free.McNaughton had a free that was finally given as a wide deep into added time when it appeared over, but the goal Antrim needed wouldn#t come as Westmeath held on for a crucial win.ANTRIM: R Elliott S Rooney, J Dillon, P Duffin M Donnelly, S McCrory, C McHugh C McCann , N McKeague N Elliott , J McNaughton , K RiceE O#Neill, K Molloy , C Clarke.

He said the attack was only called off because even the UVFs bloodthirsty leadership in Belfast considered it a step too far.The same claims were made in the past by former RUC officer Billy McCaughey, now deceased, who was convicted alongside Weir for the sectarian murder of a chemist in Ahoghill in .Filmmaker Sean Murray spent four years working on the documentary.\"John Weir said he firmly believed it was British intelligence, thats what I also believe,\" he said.\"When I say that, I mean hawks within British intelligence, as I think there was an internal power battle going on. \"There were people who would have been against that, but the hawks wanted a gloves-off approach to the IRA.

In court and in interviews, Ghosn has insisted he is innocent and said he wants to fight the case in court.The lawyer questioned why Nissan chose to seek Ghosn’s arrest.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Junichiro Hironaka “I also found it bizarre why this became a case to start with. It feels more like an internal matter for Nissan … but somehow it was taken to the prosecutors,” he said.Nissan, based in Yokohama near Tokyo, issued a statement saying it was “not in a position to comment on judicial matters and criminal charges, which must be resolved between the prosecutors, the courts, and the defendant. Put simply, we are not in a position to comment directly or specically on Ghosn’s legal defence”.The statement reiterated Nissan’s earlier comments on such issues.Mr Hironaka said thatprosecutors have a strong case against Ghosn, they could release him pending his trial instead of keeping him on the grounds he might tamper with evidence.“These issues cannot meet international standards,” he said. “I think this case could present an opportunity to review and reform problems” in the legal system, he added.Mr Hironaka refused to sayGhosn will try for a third time to gain release on bail, noting the defence team was still working out its strategy.Ghosn hired Mr Hironaka and another new lawyer, Hiroshi Kawatsu, last week, beefing up his legal team ahead of his trial. Mr Hironaka has a strong track record for winning rare acquittals in a country where the conviction rate is %. Kawatsu is an expert on judicial reform who has studied and done research in the US.Ghosn and another Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, were arrested just after landing at Tokyo’s Haneda International Airport. Kelly was granted bail pending his trial on charges he allegedly helped Ghosn under-report millions of dollars of income.The arrests “out of the blue” could frighten others doing business in Japan, Mr Hironaka said. “Like,they come to Japan, they could face such a terrible situation, like suddenly they could be taken into the prosecutors’ custody,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"red sea discovery offers hope for worlds coral reefs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Experts estimate that half of the corals that existed in the early th century have died.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  An expert on coral reefs measures the water temperature of tanks treated to simulate future climate change conditions But the corals at the northernmost tip of the Red Sea are exhibiting remarkable resistance to the rising water temperatures and acidication, according to recent research conducted by the Inter-University Institute for Marine Sciences based in Eilat. Experts hope the lessons learned in the Red Sea can help coral reefs where in the world.“Corals worldwide are dying and suffering at a rapid pace, but we have not witnessed a single bleaching event in the Gulf of Aqaba,” said Maoz Fine, an expert on coral reefs at Bar-Ilan University and director of the research.Warmer water causes corals to eject the brightly coloured plants that serve as their primary food and oxygen source. This causes reefs to “bleach”, or take on a bone-white colour.While other hardy coral species can be found in the Indian and Pacic oceans, Mr Fine said “there’s nowhere  in the world that reefs are this far away from their bleaching thresholds”. He said plenty of other refuges remain unknown, but “this is the only spot we know of with a warranty ensuring these reefs stay safe for the next several decades”.On a recent day at the lab, Mr Fine examined coral fragments in water treated to simulate future global warming scenarios, pointing to their ruddy colour as a sign of good health.The Gulf of Aqaba has become a refuge for tough corals that are projected to outlast far worse future conditions. Mr Fine’s latest study, published this month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, found further cause for optimism: The coral species’ thermal resistance carries over to their offspring, indicating that future generations will also remain immune to bleaching, with implications that could extend beyond this spot of the Red Sea.His research credits northern Red Sea coral resilience to a giant natural selection event that occurred some , years ago. As glaciers retreated at the end of the ice age, reefs moved in to recolonise the southern part of the sea, where temperatures ran exceedingly high.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A er’s view of the Red Sea Only corals that could bear the heat managed to reach maturity and migrate north, where they resettled in conditions several degrees cooler than their thermal threshold. Further research is under way to determine how existing in temperatures below their tolerance levels may lend corals physiological benefits.“All corals were obliterated except for the best genotypes, the winners of the climate change lottery,” said Mr Fine. Today, these hardy corals continue to survive as Red Sea waters warm, only showing signs of heat stress at six degrees above the summer maximum sea temperature.“Not only does this give us an incentive to protect this special refuge as much as possible, but also allows us to find hints as to the most important genes for thermal resistance,” he added.Picking out winning genes can contribute to an urgent worldwide push to restore and repopulate dead reefs. Some cutting-edge labs in Hawaii and Australia have even started crossbreeding the corals that survived or recovered from the mass bleaching of their reefs to create gene banks of “super-corals” that they hope can survive future elevated temperatures.“If corals are surviving and reproducing in the Gulf of Aqaba under stressful conditions, and in the central and southern Red Sea they’re not, we can reseed the hardy corals in nearby bleached areas,” said Jacqueline De La Cour, operations manager for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch. “Entirely new ecosystems that can withstand climate change would be established.”The US agency has honed such restoration techniques in Florida, where reefs play a critical role in softening the blow of hurricanes.Jessica Bellworthy, a student in Mr Fine’s lab, said that while it is too soon to tell whether Gulf of Aqaba corals would retain their resiliencemultiplied and transplanted to other environments, it is a “direction we could eventually take our data”."},{"url":null,"title":"derry college wins place semi final bbc northern ireland school choir year","story":"Thornhill College in Derry has won a place in the semi-finals of the BBC Northern Ireland School Choir Of The Year, which will take place at Regent House Grammar School, Newtownards.Over the course of nine weeks,  choirs from across Northern Ireland will be singing to impress as they battle it out for a place in the final of the BBC Northern Ireland School Choir Of The Year.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9432334.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

But, clever marketing tricks aside, it is worth emphasising that doomsday scenario shortages are not inevitable.Keep calm and dont panic buyBritainrsquos food supplies are heavily linked to trade with the EU. The latest figures from the UK government suggest that, on average, the EU supplies % of all food consumed in the UK and there is concern that customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would delay deliveries to the UK. Supermarkets rely on very frequent deliveries and hold limited reserves so there is an issue here.As Britain produces half of the food it consumes and because trade of food with the EU will hardly stop overnight on March , it is tempting to think that food shortages are nothing more than scaremongering. But the situation is slightly more complex than it initially seems. For example, while the UK does produce % of its own food, this figure is an average. For certain goods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, the actual figure is nearer to just %. This means the UK is much more dependent on fresh fruit and vegetable imports from the EU than other food stuffs.Plus, while Brexit is unlikely to stop trade with the EU, a no-deal scenario will likely result in a default to World Trade Organization rules. This means tarfs would need to be paid. To ensure compliance, food would need to be checked at the ports.Read more: J D Wetherspoon favours more UK products as we move towards BrexitA recent study by researchers at Imperial College London found that just two extra minutes spent checking each vehicle could translate to jams of up to  miles. At peak times, Kent could see nearly five hours of traffic delays. For short shelf-le foods like fruit and vegetables, this could be catastrophic.Another important consideration is the practical configuration of UK ports. A signicant proportion of the UKrsquos food imports from the EU come in through channel ports such as Dover and Felixstowe. These use ferries designed for food to be carried in trucks which use a ldquoroll-on, roll-off system at either side. Much of the UKrsquos existing international shipping, by comparison, comes in on crates which use a ldquoload-on, load-off system.The two systems are not readily interchangeable meaning that the UK could not simply ert shipping from the EU to its west coast ports to reduce inspection queues. Nor could it rapidly increase food deliveries from non-EU countries without signicant expansion work and also careful tarf negotiation to prevent the same queues occurring there too.It is therefore very likely that a no-deal Brexit scenario would result in some initial delays. Nonetheless there are ways that the UK can prepare to stop these hold ups turning into actual shortages of food:. PrioritiseWhile delays at ports are likely to be inevitable in a no-deal scenario, for certain products, like dried food and store cupboard staples that donrsquot need refrigeration, they pose no threat to the quality of the food. This means it should be possible to shortlist and streamline the process for top priority foods like fresh fruit and vegetables and meats so that they get through ahead of the queues.The employment of an extra , inspectors by HMRC in anticipation of Brexit should help facilitate this process.Hopes both London and planned new Manchester route can be saved - CoDA Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DERR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DERR | Article Teaser\". Contingency planningResearch Irsquove carried out has shown that many of the large food retailers have decades of experience in dealing with unexpected disruptions and will have plans in place to minimise them. These include stockpiling but also the capacity to fly in goods by air freight.This last option, while expensive and still liable for tarfs, would help to temporarily reduce dependency on channel ports. So there is reason to be confident that short-term price spikes passed on to consumers are more likely than large-scale shortages.Read more: How the UK Visas and Immigration department is preparing for Brexit. Avoid panic buyingIf the current trend for Brexit boxes is anything to go by, it is likely that consumers will rush to stock up on emergency foods such as tinned goods and bottled drinks in the build-up to March , in lieu of a Brexit deal. Ironically, these products are also the least likely to suffer from a ened border check as they will not spoil. In fact, it is only panic buying that will cause any kind of disruption.It is important to remember that, ultimately, while delays are likely in the event of a no-deal Brexit, they will be temporary and only pose a risk for certain goods with a short shelf le. Some panic buying might be inevitable, but in worst case scenarios this will result in shops running out of one item but still having similar alternatives to choose from.Research by Jamie Stone, Research Associate at the Centre for Sustainable Manufacturing and Recycling Technologies , Loughborough University.

which Tim Peake used to get to and from the International Space Station, as well as experience the UK astronaut’sto Earth first hand without leaving the ground.Press Eye - Belfast - Northern Ireland - th February Picture Matt Mackey   Press Eye.Presented by Samsung and the Science Museum Group, the national tour entitled Tim Peake’s Spacecraft includes the Russian-made Soyuz TMA-M capsule – complete with equipped interior and char marks on its outer body from its re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.The capsule is exhibited along with its -metre diameter parachute and the Sokol KV- spacesuit Peake wore during his high-speed descent.Accompanying the spacecraft is the unique Space Descent VR experience, which with the help of Samsung Gear VR technology, puts visitors at the heart of Tim Peake’s historic -milevoyage to Earth from the ISS and is voiced by the astronaut himself who is the UK’s first European Space Agency astronaut.The spacecraft was acquired by the Science Museum Group soon after itsto Earth and the visit to the Ulster Transport Museum is the last stop on an eight location tour. at the launch of the exhibition of Tim Peakes Spacecraft at the Ulster Transport Museum

exhibition of Tim Peakes Spacecraft at the Ulster Transport Museum are Dr Norah Patten, aeronautical engineer and Science-Astronaut candidate Hannah Crowdy, Head of Curatorial at National Museums NI and Doug Millard, Space Curator, Science Museum Group.Although the exhibition is first opened to the public today, some NI school groups have been given early access to view the spacecraft.Doug Millard, space curator of the Science Museum Group, said: “I’ve been watching the school kids huddling around the spacecraft – their eyes are as big as saucers.“They’re aware that this is something special. Something that they’ll probably remember for the rest of their lives.”He added: “The object is the icon, butyou do need to do a little bit more to convey the amazing journey it has been on – parts of it really quite rough, bumpy, even violent. That’s where the VR experience helps.” Press Eye - Belfast - Northern Ireland - th February Picture Matt Mackey   Press Eye.Pointing out the scorch damage to the capsule which had to slow from over , kilometres per hour and was heated to more than , degrees centigrade, he said: “It didn’t look like this when it went up into space. It’s showing the scars of a space flight.“It is made from an aluminium alloy structure coated with plastic which is designed to burn to take the heat away from the capsule.”Of the exhibition in the Ulster Transport Museum, Doug said: “I can’t think of a nicer area to have it on display, surrounded by locomotives – all these wonderful machines from the past converging on the space age.”Loughinisland: Doug Beattie calls for probe into police ombudsman’s reportNorthern Ireland millennials splash cash on takeaways, eating out and coffees Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"After spending six months on board the International Space Station, Peake ed to Earth with Russia’s Yuri Malenchenko and America’s Tim Kopra in the Soyuz spacecraft.News Letter journalist Graeme Cousins at the launch of the exhibition of Tim Peakes Spacecraft at the Ulster Transport Museum. Picture: Pacemaker Press.After a four-hour descent, the capsule landed onto the plains of Kazakhstan. Head of curatorial at National Museums Northern Ireland, Hannah Crowdy said: “It’s the first time we’ve had a single iconic loan from another national museum in the gallery, and it’s certainly the first time we’ve really explored space travel.“We feel it fits really well with our transport collection.“What is fascinating about the Soyuz capsule is it’s a feat of scientic research and engineering and a lot of skill and technical talent, but that alone wouldn’t be a compelling story. “You’ve got the story of Tim Peake and the other astronauts, real human courage and achievement, pushing themselves beyond their normal limitations.“That’s very much in line with our transport collections, for example the Crossle racing car which was invented by a local designerwho couldn’t afford his own racing car.“We have people like James Martin, who invented the ejector seat, Rex McCandless, another great inventor from this part of the world– a lot of people who have really achieved things.”The largest part of the exhibition is the space capsule’s parachute, which was used to slow the spacecraft from a speed of  kilometres per hour to  kilometres per hour in its final stage of descent to Earth.Hannah said: “The parachute is about the size of two tennis courts in area. “It’s got its own orange markings which were used to be able to locate it from the air after landing.“It is attached to the capsule by the ropes originally used on it, and draped across the exhibition space. “When you come in the first thing people will see is the parachute, then they’ll look down and see the capsule.”One of the special guests at yesterday’s preview of the Ulster Transport Museum’s Tim Peake Spacecraft exhibition was Dr Norah Patten, who is on course to become Ireland’s first astronaut.The Co Mayo woman was the first Irish participant at astronautics programme Project PoSSUM where she completed high-g flights, hypoxia training, aviation egress training and spacesuit testing and evaluations.She explained: “Space has been my thing since I was in primary school. “I have an aunt and cousins living in Cleveland, Ohio. We went to visit them when I was  and went to NASA. I was in awe, I wanted to know more about space travel.“When I was  I got to Kennedy Space Center in Florida.“After that was when I decided I wanted to do aeronautical engineering.Of the Soyuz capsule she said: “I think sometimes we can take space travel for granted. It’s incredible, it’s dangerous, it’s not glamourous. “The Soyuz capsule puts it in context. The movies give it a romantic notion. The reality is you’re going to be couped up in a tight space for hours on end.”The exhibition opens today and will remain on display at the museum for three months until Sunday, May .Tim Peake’s spacecraft is free to visit, and Space Descent VR will be available to visitors aged  and over for £.For more information about the exhibition, visit www.nmni soyuzThoughts on the exhibitionWhen you think of space travel it tends to conjure images of super-slick, state-of-the-art, shiny white rockets blasting off after a countdown from .And then you see the Soyuz spacecraft in the Ulster Transport Museum and it brings you back to Earth with a bump It looks like a relic of days gone by – a disused prop from the very first Star Wars movie in  – a hunk of junk incapable of withstanding a strong gust of wind, never mind getting you to the International Space Station and back.And that is the beauty of science and technology, looks can be oh so deceiving.Having taken part in the VR experience I learnt of the amazing journey that this tiny pod took Tim Peake and his two fellow astronauts on.Although I was aware of what the mission entailed, like many, it resonates a little more when you’ve got props such as the capsule itself, attached parachute and a front row seat for the descent.As a virtual astronautI sat on board the Soyuz as it was disconnected from the space station and began to fall through space. As someone who is not great with heights it wasn’t as unnerving as I thought it was going to be, but no less astounding.On the descent through the Earth’s atmosphere the Soyuz caught fire, but we were prevented from being turned into a microwave ready meal by the special cladding on the outside of the capsule.To slow us down as we got closer to landing a huge parachute was opened.None of this sounds like rocket science – in fact it has the feel of that science project where you have to protect a falling egg using a structure made from paper, straws and string. But, as we know, this crude capsule got the job done and a safe but bumpy landing was made in Kazakhstan.The journey to Cultra was no doubt a lot smoother and now the story becomes all the more tenable for visitors to the Ulster Transport Museum thanks to the exhibition which brings a modern feat of science onto our doorsteps.More space-based fun and learningTo celebrate the arrival of Tim Peake’s spacecraft the Ulster Transport Museum will play host to LaTe LaB, an adults-only light hearted evening of marvellous scientic experiments, shows and music inspired by the exhibition.

Itrsquos an event that is becoming bigger every year for the month of January.The event is where people decide to try veganism out for an entire month after Christmas. This means cutting out both meat, dairy and eggs.But where can you goyoursquore looking to try out veganism in Penarth  There are a lot of dferent places you can eat out and shop in, says Penarth based vegan and fair organiser Sue Thomas.Ms Thomas has been vegan for many years and aims to share her lestyle through her vegan fairs, which feature a wide iety of food stalls and gt stalls.And throughout her many years of veganism, Ms Thomas said she has never struggled in Penarth and recommends people to look locally and ask for options.ldquoI get a lot of my vitamins from Pro Health and Nutrition in Stanwell Road, she said.ldquoItrsquos a great health shop and the owner Juliet is so friendly and helpful. They stock many vegan vitamins and products.ldquoWindsor Fruit Stores in the Windsor Arcade are my favourites for amazing fruit and vegetables, I buy a lot of wonderful organic fruit and vegetables from them.ldquoThe owners Mike and Tricia are so helpful and always suggest things for me. Unusual fruits and veg too from time to time. They also have a great supplier that does not spray their produce.Ms Thomas recommends trying to switch dairy milk for other options, and for those taking part in Veganuary she suggests oat milk.ldquoI personally love oat milk as itrsquos so good in coffee and I love it on my cereal, she said.ldquoI do buy Oatly Barista from Jos Organics in Glebe Street which is yet another great place for vegan goodies or sometimes I do go to Sainsburys and the Co-op.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

You canrsquot keep putting everything in the same place.ldquoThe Welsh Government seem hell bent with concreting every last bit of land in the whole of Wales.ldquoWe canrsquot keep swamping the same areas that canrsquot cope with the traffic and lack of services with house after house.ldquoItrsquos sheer madness.Asbri Planning, which is drawing up the plans along with Austin Smith: Lord Architects, has applied to the Vale council for a scoping opinion as to whether the new homes would have a signicant impact on the environment, and therefore need an environmental impact assessment.Councillor Jonathan Bird, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for regeneration and planning, said:ldquoNo planning application has yet been submitted, rather there have been screening and scoping submissions. These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This prompted more research into the lives of the men who had died, since collected into a book.As part of the centennial observance, Glass by Design produced special artwork including glass poppies, while wire artist Nina Lazarou leading wire poppy making sessions. Poppy wreaths were delivered to the Penarth households the  men had lived in to display.Glass by Design wished to extend their thanks to Nina Lazarou, Karen Hughes, who oversaw  pieces of art by ex-servicemen that were placed on display, and to Foxyrsquos Deli, Ogam Igam and David Baker who had special window displays of the work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages.
