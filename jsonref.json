He’s currently the Workers’ Party candidate for President of Brazil in the upcoming 2018 election.Haddad was born in São Paulo, Brazil on January 25, 1963.The son of Lebanese immigrants, he earned a master’s degree in economics and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of São Paulo before starting a career as an investment analyst at Unibanco.Haddad later worked as a consultant for the Institute of Economic Research Foundation before moving into public sector work, finding employment as the chief of staff to the Finance and Economic Development Secretary for São Paulo and eventually as a special advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management.Climbing the ranks of government steadily, he later was named as the Minister of Education for Brazil in July 2005. During his tenure, Haddad established the Basic Education Development Index to help better measure the quality of public primary and middle schools in Brazil.He also oversaw the implementation of a new scholarship program aimed at helping low-income students attend private colleges and made numerous reforms to the country’s National High School Exam.Haddad left his position in January 2012 and was named as the candidate for Mayor of São Paulo during the 2012 municipal elections in Brazil. After advancing to the second round of the election, he defeated the city’s former mayor, José Serra, with just over 55 per cent of the vote.After assuming his new duties as mayor in January 2013, he implemented a sweeping expansion of the city’s bike lane network but later sparked a major backlash in June of that year after announcing, along with the government of the state of São Paulo, that mass transit ticket prices would be increased.The decision ultimately led to mass protests in the São Paulo and many other major Brazilian cities.          Fernando Haddad served as the Mayor of São Paulo from January 2013 until January 2017By July 2016, Haddad was hobbled by a dismal approval ratings of only 14 per cent of city residents and lost his reelection bid in October 2016 to João Doria, the Brazilian Social Democracy party candidate.He ultimately left office in January 2017 after a four-year tenure as mayor of Brazil’s largest city.As the 2018 Brazil elections loomed, he was named as former President Lula da Silva’s running mate in August in his bid to regain the presidency.However, da Silva was later ruled as disqualified from running for president again by the Superior Electoral Court for violating the country’s Clean Record Act shortly afterwards on August 31 due to his conviction on corruption charges.Haddad was eventually named as da Silva’s replacement by the Workers’ Party on September 11 while Brazil Communist Party legislator Manuela d\u0027Ávila took his place as the candidate for vice president. 2018 Brazil election polls   According a recent Americas SocietyCouncil of the Americas poll, Haddad is currently in second place ahead of the election, which will be held in stages from October 7 to October 28. Haddad leads a number of other candidates but still trails Bolsonaro, the conservative populist frontrunner of the Social Liberty Party who many have compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro leads the poll with 35 percent of the vote while Haddad trails with 22 percent. Notably, Haddad\u0027s polling numbers have largely flatlined in recent days while Bolsonaro has surged ahead, making his victory, while not a sure thing, all the more likely as the election gets underway.Made by Google Pixel 3: How to watch the event and what to expectWorld Post Day: 2018 theme, date and moreNew Kids on the Block Mixtape Tour 2019: Dates, tickets, support acts and moreJohn Terry\u0027s net worth revealed after he retires from football2018 midterms: When are the voter registration deadlines in all the 50 states?The Walking Dead Season 9 Spoilers: What time does it start in the UK and what happens in the premiere?How to tell if your Facebook account has been hackedStrictly Come Dancing: Seann Walsh and Katya Jones slammed by Piers MorganRiverdale season 3: Spoilers, premiere date, time, trailer, cast and more revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

The firm has pledged to review its labelling methods following criticism from the coroner.The Bridor plant in Servon-sur-Vilaine that supplies Pret dominates an industrial estate just off the E50 arterial motorway across Europe.The complex is surrounded by a large security fence, with its financial success only alluded to by an adjoining glass building housing the headquarters of its multi-billion parent company, Group Le Duff.    Mother of five Celia Marsh, 42, died last December after eating a ‘super-veg rainbow flatbread’ containing a yoghurt that was supposed to be dairy-free but contained milkBakers leaving the factory over the weekend were reluctant to speak and Bridor did not respond to requests for comment. However one worker in the firm’s head office confirmed the factory provided bread to Pret in Britain.Bridor also has a base in Camberley, Surrey, staffed by young bakers from Eastern Europe, France, Italy and even China, all working round the clock.The Mail has seen a label from a box of 30 part-baked frozen Bridor baguettes which were in use at a central London Pret last week. The date of production was September 6 2018 and the best before September 6 2019.Bridor is not believed to Pret’s only bread supplier. George Fuller of the Craft Bakers Association said: ‘Their products could easily be made in Britain, which is quite frustrating.‘Their decision to describe their products as fresh and natural has the potential to annoy our members. There is no legal definition for this, as such, so you end up in a situation where they can call their products what they want.‘The demise of the high street baker is a serious concern to us and the fact a chain with such a big presence in Britain is making their bread abroad is a worry.’    Pret was already in the spotlight because of last month’s inquest into the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse (pictured) from an allergic reaction to sesame seeds in a baguetteEarlier this year, Pret was at the centre of a case involving the Advertising Standards Authority about the descriptions it uses for its products. As a result it was told to stop using the word ‘natural’ in its marketing and on its website because of the use of several additives in its supplier-made bread.The Real Bread Campaign had found E-numbers in its bread which were not labelled on packs. However, Pret was allowed to keep saying its bread was freshly-baked as the ASA said customers would not necessarily think that meant it was made from scratch.Yesterday, Pret did not dispute that it used Bridor as a supplier. When asked specifically about describing frozen products as fresh, it referred the Mail to the ASA ruling.The Pret statement said: ‘The ASA ruled that consumers were unlikely to interpret “baked in store” to mean only products that were made from scratch using basic raw materials such as flour and butter.          A statement from Pret said the ASA ruled consumers were \u0027unlikely to interpret “baked in store” to mean only products that were made from scratch using basic raw materials...\u0027‘We considered that consumers were likely to interpret it to include products which were cooked from frozen raw dough or from part-baked dough.’Pret also said: ‘Once the bread is fully-baked in shops it is sold on the day or given to charity.’There is no suggestion that Bridor was in any way responsible for Natasha’s death, a point made by a Pret a Manger spokesman.Boxes of baguettes sent to Pret a Manger from Bridor, which is said to make products for coffee chains Starbucks, Costa and Caffè Nero, clearly label all ingredients and allergen information in four languages.One ‘artisan’ baguette label seen by the Mail also listed the potential allergens wheat, gluten and nuts.The founder of Bridor is billionaire Frenchman Louis Le Duff, known as the “pastry king”.He made his fortune after founding French cafe chain Brioche Dorée in 1976. It now has more than 600 bakeries around the world, with Le Duff vowing that it would have a turnover of one billion euros a year by 2020. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/13/4ECAE5C700000578-0-image-a-6_1534162674141.jpg","title":"World Post Day 2018 theme date more","story":"Made by Google Pixel 3: How to watch the event and what to expectWorld Post Day: 2018 theme, date and moreNew Kids on the Block Mixtape Tour 2019: Dates, tickets, support acts and moreJohn Terry\u0027s net worth revealed after he retires from football2018 midterms: When are the voter registration deadlines in all the 50 states?The Walking Dead Season 9 Spoilers: What time does it start in the UK and what happens in the premiere?How to tell if your Facebook account has been hackedStrictly Come Dancing: Seann Walsh and Katya Jones slammed by Piers MorganRiverdale season 3: Spoilers, premiere date, time, trailer, cast and more revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

To now learn that the factory isn’t even in the UK is simply shocking.’The revelation follows news that a second Pret customer had died following an allergic reaction.She was named yesterday as Celia Marsh, 42.

The firm has pledged to review its labelling methods following criticism from the coroner.The Bridor plant in Servon-sur-Vilaine that supplies Pret dominates an industrial estate just off the E50 arterial motorway across Europe.The complex is surrounded by a large security fence, with its financial success only alluded to by an adjoining glass building housing the headquarters of its multi-billion parent company, Group Le Duff.    Mother of five Celia Marsh, 42, died last December after eating a ‘super-veg rainbow flatbread’ containing a yoghurt that was supposed to be dairy-free but contained milkBakers leaving the factory over the weekend were reluctant to speak and Bridor did not respond to requests for comment. However one worker in the firm’s head office confirmed the factory provided bread to Pret in Britain.Bridor also has a base in Camberley, Surrey, staffed by young bakers from Eastern Europe, France, Italy and even China, all working round the clock.The Mail has seen a label from a box of 30 part-baked frozen Bridor baguettes which were in use at a central London Pret last week. The date of production was September 6 2018 and the best before September 6 2019.Bridor is not believed to Pret’s only bread supplier. George Fuller of the Craft Bakers Association said: ‘Their products could easily be made in Britain, which is quite frustrating.‘Their decision to describe their products as fresh and natural has the potential to annoy our members. There is no legal definition for this, as such, so you end up in a situation where they can call their products what they want.‘The demise of the high street baker is a serious concern to us and the fact a chain with such a big presence in Britain is making their bread abroad is a worry.’    Pret was already in the spotlight because of last month’s inquest into the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse (pictured) from an allergic reaction to sesame seeds in a baguetteEarlier this year, Pret was at the centre of a case involving the Advertising Standards Authority about the descriptions it uses for its products. As a result it was told to stop using the word ‘natural’ in its marketing and on its website because of the use of several additives in its supplier-made bread.The Real Bread Campaign had found E-numbers in its bread which were not labelled on packs. However, Pret was allowed to keep saying its bread was freshly-baked as the ASA said customers would not necessarily think that meant it was made from scratch.Yesterday, Pret did not dispute that it used Bridor as a supplier. When asked specifically about describing frozen products as fresh, it referred the Mail to the ASA ruling.The Pret statement said: ‘The ASA ruled that consumers were unlikely to interpret “baked in store” to mean only products that were made from scratch using basic raw materials such as flour and butter.          A statement from Pret said the ASA ruled consumers were \u0027unlikely to interpret “baked in store” to mean only products that were made from scratch using basic raw materials...\u0027‘We considered that consumers were likely to interpret it to include products which were cooked from frozen raw dough or from part-baked dough.’Pret also said: ‘Once the bread is fully-baked in shops it is sold on the day or given to charity.’There is no suggestion that Bridor was in any way responsible for Natasha’s death, a point made by a Pret a Manger spokesman.Boxes of baguettes sent to Pret a Manger from Bridor, which is said to make products for coffee chains Starbucks, Costa and Caffè Nero, clearly label all ingredients and allergen information in four languages.One ‘artisan’ baguette label seen by the Mail also listed the potential allergens wheat, gluten and nuts.The founder of Bridor is billionaire Frenchman Louis Le Duff, known as the “pastry king”.He made his fortune after founding French cafe chain Brioche Dorée in 1976. It now has more than 600 bakeries around the world, with Le Duff vowing that it would have a turnover of one billion euros a year by 2020. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/08/12/1BA9161000000514-0-image-a-12_1538999903089.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles sister says handing letter guards palace gates mission accomplished","story":"    In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Samantha Markle denied attempting to demand to see her sister and described the visit to the UK as ‘a wonderful experience’  Samantha Markle and Meghan are no longer on speaking terms after high-profile bust ups tore the Markle family apart‘I was very respectful and I went there to deliver a letter.

At this year’s Brighton Photo Biennial,13-to-16-year-olds raise their concerns and confusions about this spectre through their photographic works, in a section called Why Are We Leaving?. None of them were old enough to vote in the June 2016 referendum.The title of the biennial is A New Europe. It explores Brexit and a permanently reshaped Europe through photography and video works across eight venues in Brighton. It also reveals many untold stories – such as those teenagers’.A close up of a button on a fruit machine on Brighton Pier shows a young finger about to press “start”. The photographer, aged 13, says that she wanted to show how Brexit is like a gamble – people pushed a button without knowing what the results would really be. When I asked the teenage photographers how they imagine the UK five years from now, they said “more police control, expensive travel, expensive food”, with one of them adding, “I think it will be much harder to see my grandma who lives in Germany.” They can’t even imagine studying or working in the EU.Shoair Mavlian, the curator of the biennial and the director of Photoworks, says that the event is not trying to investigate the process of Brexit, but to give an opportunity for people to talk about it. There are public forums and performances taking place every week until the end of the biennial. Uta Kögelsberger’s work, which features portraits of and words by people who will leave the UK because of Brexit, will be shown on Jubilee Square.“The title of the biennial has been selected to be purposefully ambiguous,” says Mavlian. “The idea of a new Europe has meant different things at different times. Hitler used this term, then after the fall of the iron curtain it had a completely different meaning. Europe is not fixed, it’s always changing.”The biennial shows evidence of the change. Vintage photographs from the Cross Channel Photographic Mission archive of the late 1980s show the construction of the Channel Tunnel. Nine photographers’ works illustrate how the construction changed the landscape, and show the people who made it happen: including Jean-Claude Juncker, now president of the European Commission.Bill Brandt’s images from the 1930s document English life across the class ide, and are recognised as one of the first attempts to photograph the nation. Tereza Červeňová, a UK-based European artist, has taken a photograph every day since EU referendum – a diary unnervingly filled with important events from recent European history. She was in Nice on the day of the 14 July 2016 terror attack, for instance, and staying near London Bridge when there was a terror attack the following June.Emeric Lhuisset tells stories of different generations who migrated to Europe from the Middle East on his cyanotypes – a photographic process that creates a blue and white image by using sunlight to expose silhouette or shadows on to treated paper. They will completely fade into blue blocks one day – either merging into Europe, perhaps, or disappearing. Best known for her fashion photography, Harley Weir’s exhibition depicts the now-demolished camp in Calais known as the Jungle. She focuses on the fragile structures, tents, pieces of wood nailed to each other, and ropes and nets knotted together so that toothbrushes and frying pans have a place to be hung. Without the presence of people in states of resilience and despair, it’s an eerie memorial to this pressure point of the refugee crisis.The biennial demonstrates that Brexit and its connected issues, including the migration crisis and the rise of the far right, have provided rich material for photographers. However, most if not all the works come from the leftliberal perspective, which gives the impression of artists preaching to the converted. The director, Mavlian, says that “no sides were taken,” but the voices of those enthused by Brexit are few and far between. Perhaps that’s for another time – because what the biennial does show is that the story of Brexit is only just beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0d00e2b874e9e73c0d66fed886397ebec3b5c33/0_0_4633_3089/master/4633.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=796dd2e68b2018b748d96d5cfcce6723 660w","title":"after metoo do we need women only colleges more than ever","story":"Studying among smart, empowered women at a single-sex college has given me the confidence to challenge gender normsAt face value, this recommendation may appear counterintuitive. It calls on women to self-segregate, and to use this as a vehicle to overturn the unequal distribution of power that causes them to self-segregate in the first place.This is precisely the ethos that has underpinned women-only colleges since their founding in the nineteenth century. Whereas in the past it was a cultural mandate for women to submit to sexual segregation, today they can be empowering spaces to counter these forces. Equally, research has shown that students at single-sex institutions are more likely to rate themselves above average in intellectual self-confidence and are more likely to study for doctorates. They are also 1.5 times more likely to major in Stem subjects than their peers.In the words of Sian Beilock, the president of Barnard College, their students “inhabit a world where girls truly rule, where women lead by definition and habit and where female role models abound”. Many women’s colleges also offer specialist internships and career mentoring opportunities, which can counteract the old boys’ networks in certain industries. This nurturing environment fosters self-reliance and confidence in women. This is particularly important for women of black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, as well as those who are socio-economically disadvantaged – both constituencies that are increasingly enrolling in women’s colleges.Having the confidence and courage to go out into the world and claim it as your own is, according to one sociologist, foundational to the ethos of women’s colleges. Young women are trained to lead in a way that does not “simply mimic masculine techniques, but is tailored to feminine strengths”. This helps graduates cope with workplace behaviours from male peers and bosses that include everything from harassment and discrimination, to being talked over in meetings and sidelined from conversations where decisions are really made.As a woman of minority background myself, attending a women’s college encouraged me to find my voice, write my own script, and confidently challenge gender norms. After years of putting together technology conferences for business leaders across the world, I routinely observe the woeful underrepresentation of women in senior Stem jobs. I was thankfully oblivious to these gender disparities as a young woman because I was trained among smart and empowered women.Critics of women’s colleges may argue that the physical and social barriers these colleges erect are regressive and unfit for the realities of the real world. Are they not just siloed utopias that patch over the deeper systemic social conditions and structures that curb women’s opportunities? Possibly, but this works to their advantage.The former director of Oxfam, Barbara Stocking, once said of her college experience: “It sounds unbelievable, but I almost didn’t know there was discrimination against women until I left. It gave you the kind of confidence that made you feel you could take on the world.” This confidence is the bedrock of the shattering of the highest glass ceilings by many alumnae of women’s colleges.Join  Universities for more comment and analysis direct to your inbox.

Venom began in the UK with £5.65m from 556 cinemas, and £8.03m including takings last Wednesday and Thursday.One comparison might be with Spider-Man: Homecoming, which is likewise a collaboration between Marvel and Sony – that one debuted with £6.77m and £9.37m including previews, in July 2017. However, Venom doesn’t have equivalent brand value to Spider-Man, and unlike Homecoming does not include Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige among its roster of producers.The current IMDb user rating for Venom is a decent 7.110, suggesting that so far fans are not sharing the rather dismal opinion of critics. Spider-Man: Homecoming has a 7.510 rating. These ratings tend to soften after the initial release period as a broader swathe of film fans see and rate a title.In a nice counter-programming move to Venom, Universal-released Johnny English Strikes Again, the third in the series featuring Rowan Atkinson’s bumbling spy. A UK debut gross of £4.12m compares with an opening salvo of £4.97m for Johnny English Reborn back in October 2011. Factor in ticket-price inflation, and that is a notable softening of interest in the character this time around.On the other hand, a £4m-plus debut is not too shabby, and the backers may be pleased that there remains interest in Johnny English 15 years after the first movie. The October half-term holiday is yet to come, and Johnny English Strikes Again should perform solidly throughout that period.With a debut of £3.08m and £4.10m including last Wednesday and Thursday, A Star Is Born delivered a number that might have topped the UK box office chart in another week. In fact, on 18 previous occasions this year, the chart was topped by a film grossing less than A Star Is Born’s debut total.Comparisons for A Star Is Born are hard to make, since it’s not a musical or a music biopic, but instead a fictional romantic drama set against the music scene – and those are few and far between. One comparison point might be the Dublin-set Once, but that was a small-scale film featuring a little-known cast. Another might be 8 Mile, although its story was informed by the life of its star, and 2002 was really a different era in terms of film distribution.It’s very rare to see three films all open at £4m-plus in a single weekend – there are no previous occasions of this phenomenon occurring in the last five years. Examples of three new titles robustly segmenting the market include the mid-February 2016 instance when Deadpool, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip and Zoolander 2 all arrived together in the top three places, but the Zoolander film began with just £2.09m. Similarly, in mid-October 2015, Hotel Transylvania 2, Suffragette and Pan landed together as the chart’s top titles, but Pan’s debut figure was £2.74m.1. Venom, £8,031,342 from 556 sites (new)2.

Here you can find out how all 290 have got onIn 2014 we set out to select some of the most promising players in the world and follow them for five years. It started as 20 Premier League players (one from each club) and 40 from the rest of the world. The global one was quickly expanded to 50 (2015) and the current 60 (2016 and 2017), meaning this year we have chased updates for 290 players.It has been a fascinating journey to find out how these extremely talented players have done. Some of them, such as Marcus Rashford and Ousmane Dembélé, have become international stars while others are no longer with a club. Some have been hampered by injuries while others have made it to their club’s first team or been involved in multimillion-pound transfers.So before we announce our 2018 picks on Wednesday (Premier League) and Thursday (rest of the world) here is your chance to see how all the players have got on (and also, hopefully, appreciate that our design has improved somewhat in the past four years …). Follow the links and explore how each player has progressed by clicking on them once on the interactive.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: An excellent year for the players (and the journalists who picked them) as this crop featured Dominic Solanke and Marcus Rashford as well as Arsenal’s Chris Willock. You can find the names and the player profiles behind the badges (the Premier League one) and the flags (on the world one).Forty of the best young talents in world football: Youri Tielemans and Dembélé are among the talented players born in 1997 that we selected for this year but, for me, this year will always be remembered for Abdelhak Nouri’s inclusion. The talented Dutch midfielder was set for his international breakthrough in 2017-18 when he suffered cardiac arrhythmia and collapsed on the pitch during a friendly against Werder Bremen in July 2017. Ajax later said that Nouri had suffered permanent and serious brain damage. Earlier this year Abderrahim Nouri said that his brother had been gradually improving since the start of this year and he can now communicate with his family by moving his mouth or eyebrows.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: The player who stands out here is Trent Alexander-Arnold, who reached the Champions League final with Liverpool last season and played for England at the World Cup, while Marcus McGuane moved from Arsenal to Barcelona in January.Fifty of the best young talents in world football: It is amazing to think that Christian Pulisic is still only 20. He has played 74 Bundesliga games for Borussia Dortmund and has 21 caps for the United States. He was part of our 2015 picks and there is another BVB player among this crop: Jacob Bruun Larsen. The Dane had struggled with injuries and was loaned to Stuttgart last season, but has started the new campaign like a house on fire and recently scored three goals in three games for the first team. This year we also had “the Colombian Yaya Touré”, Dejan Lovren’s younger brother Davor and Martin Ødegaard.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: An interesting batch of players with Jadon Sancho the one who has made the most progress, having joined Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City in the summer of 2017. He was immediately given the No 7 shirt and has exploded on to the scene in Germany, earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the first time last week. Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson has also moved to Germany, while there are still high hopes for Liverpool’s Ben Woodburn and Manchester United’s Angel Gomes.Sixty of the best young talents in world football: Another year, another prodigy. Gianluigi Donnarumma was one of the players born in 1999 and an absolute certainty on the list, having played for Italy before our list was announced. He has continued to progress and has played more than 120 games for Milan. Other names to look out for here are the Belgian Mile Svilar, who became the youngest goalkeeper to play in the Champions League, Diogo Dalot (now at Manchester United) and Ajax’s Matthijs de Ligt, surely a future Oranje captain.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: These players, of course, have had only a year to progress but there are still some who are becoming well known. Callum Hudson-Odoi has played in the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup for Chelsea and was outstanding in pre-season for Maurizio Sarri, while Liverpool’s Curtis Jones made a huge impression when given a chance by Jürgen Klopp on their US tour in the summer. Spurs’ Oliver Skipp was on the bench for the recent Premier League game against Cardiff City.Sixty of the best young talents in world football: Vinícius Júnior stands out from this year group – players born in 2000 – as he comes with that astonishing €45m price tag after Real Madrid signed him from Flamengo. He missed out on a place in Brazil’s World Cup squad but impressed on loan back at Flamengo before moving to Spain in the summer. The Argentinian Benjamín Garré is impressing at Manchester City, while Bayern Munich made Alphonso Davies the most expensive Canadian ever when they signed him from Vancouver Whitecaps. Yacine Adli, meanwhile, turned down a move to Arsenal and has made his Ligue 1 debut for PSG."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31fc19e84a4fd6edb4cc396df8262bc3f2b18329/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e68c60879736d1107357974a49889694","title":"ellie roebuck ebony salmon 10 young english players womens football","story":"Women’s football in this country has never been able to draw from such a vast talent pool here we profile some of the most promising, with the Manchester clubs dominantAt a time when English women’s football can call upon its biggest-ever pool of talent, choosing 10 young English players to watch from the Super League and Championship is extremely hard. This list excludes players such as the Arsenal defender Leah Williamson, Everton’s Gabby George and Manchester City’s Keira Walsh, who have played for England, and looks instead at the level below. The supremely talented Alessia Russo and Grace Fisk have been excluded because they play in the US.The calamity own goal she conceded – courtesy of a poor Abbie McManus back pass – against Birmingham last month propelled Ellie Roebuck briefly into the mainstream. However, what was missed among the mocking was that the hugely talented keeper is only 19. Last year, after the veteran England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley landed awkwardly and was taken off minutes into a potentially title-deciding showdown at Chelsea, Roebuck stepped in and stepped up, making critical saves to deny Drew Spence and Fran Kirby that kept the match scoreless. She has continued that fine form.The left-back and law student came through Liverpool’s ranks before signing for Doncaster Rovers Belles at the start of 2017 in search of regular first-team football. A mainstay of Neil Redfearn’s tier two-winning defence last season, Pacheco signed with the Women’s Super League side Reading in the summer. She has racked up two league starts and one substitute appearance for the club since she returned from the Under-20 World Cup with a bronze medal having started every game.Morgan joined Manchester City aged 15 and, after switching from centre-forward to centre-back, impressed the first-team manager Nick Cushing on the club’s pre-season tour in 2017. After winning the Development League with City last year, she was one of the youngest players called up to Mo Marley’s side for the Under-20 World Cup and, although she did not feature, Morgan returned with a bronze medal and has captained the Under-19 team through their European Championship qualifying campaign. They secured passage with three wins, 21 goals and three clean sheets.Dean joined Tottenham from Millwall Lionesses in the summer, having been the club’s top scorer last season with 10 goals in 23 games despite a tumultuous time off the pitch leaving them on the brink of bankruptcy. Tottenham are second in the Women’s Championship – behind Manchester United and ahead of Lewes on goal difference – and the midfielder has not lost her eye for goal, chipping in with two in Spurs’ two wins before the international break.Aged 16, Park secured the Development League Cup for Manchester City, twice cutting in from the left to fire into the bottom corner against Birmingham before Morgan added a third. One of the most exciting English talents for her age, Park played as a forward and scored five goals – four against the host nation, Croatia, and the other six minutes after coming off the bench against Malta – as the young Lionesses qualified for the Under-19 European Championship final stage.The inclusion on Manchester United’s squad list of the England duo Siobhan Chamberlain and Alex Greenwood stole the headlines but those looking a little deeper at Casey Stoney’s new side will have been more surprised by Lauren James’s switch from Arsenal. The then 16-year-old had played five times for the Gunners despite her youth, and her development was showing no signs of slowing. She is part of the England Under-17 squad and began life in the Women’s Championship in emphatic fashion, scoring twice in a 12-0 opening-day demolition of Aston Villa. She has been the conductor of a dominant United side looking to climb straight into the top tier.The PFA young player of the year moved from Bristol City to Manchester City this summer after a stellar season. Having scored on her debut for the Vixens in 2016, she got nine goals in 24 games. Hemp has played for City after missing the first two League Cup fixtures because she was at the Under-20 World Cup, where she scored a hat-trick in a 6-1 defeat of Mexico.Salmon was a relative unknown before she exploded on to the scene with Aston Villa last season, having spent three years in their academy. Given her chance in the second tier, the pacy forward scored seven goals in 12 games as Villa finished ninth in the 10-team league. Salmon captained England’s Under-17 team at the 2018 European Championship, scoring a hat-trick in the quarter-final against Italy. She was recruited by Stoney in the summer but with a wealth of attacking talent ahead of her she is yet to appear for Manchester United.Toone made the move across Manchester from City to United in search of first-team football in the summer. She spent seven years with United before joining Blackburn Rovers’ academy, then City. Since moving to United she has played every game, scoring two goals, the first on her league debut. Able to play anywhere across the front three, she was nominated for England young player of the year in 2018.Stanway has had a meteoric rise since joining Manchester City from Blackburn in 2015. She made her senior debut for City at 16 and has scored 12 goals in 38 appearances. She has been a bright spark in a shaky City start this season and will surely be forcing her way into Phil Neville’s plans soon. She lit up the Under-20 World Cup, spearheading England’s charge to bronze and winning the golden boot – jointly with Spain’s Patricia Guijarro – by scoring six goals across England’s six games."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21d21945601de4e43871a2dcba35600f61c7ec36/1092_1833_926_555/master/926.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=d1dac8a35fed77a03679e3b9a87e72eb","title":"net worth v self worth do we all need inequality therapy","story":"Inequality isn’t just changing the way we deal with economics – it’s perversely altering how we see ourselves and what we valueMichael was a fortysomething middle manager at a mid-sized tech company who every day felt like a failure.Even though he was wealthy enough to send his two kids to private school, he was always anxious about his status. He frequently snapped at his wife and after working long hours, often retreated from his family with a “headache” so he didn’t have to deal with anyone’s noise or demands.Worried that his job stress would eventually destroy his marriage, Michael sought therapy with Boston psychologist Kalman Glantz, who encouraged him to look for concrete evidence that his work fears were warranted. But soon, he reported back that his superiors and co-workers had no real complaint with him and there was no actual threat to his job.Objectively, he was doing fine. However, in a treacherous economy that is increasingly inequitable, having strong self worth at work – which is where so many of us focus – has become almost impossible.In traditional cognitive therapy, a psychologist like Glantz would attempt to use discrepancies between a person’s perceptions and feelings and the reality of the situation in order to help them feel better about themselves. By learning to recognize that many fears aren’t based in fact – and directly addressing those that are —– patients can over time learn to reduce anxiety and depression, research shows.But Glantz took a different approach. He asked Michael why he even had an opinion about his status at all. Once Michael got over the weirdness of the question, the therapist worked to help him reconsider the idea of constantly worrying about whether he measured up.Inequality isn’t just changing the way we deal with economics – it’s perversely altering how we see ourselves and what we value. And Glantz and J Gary Bernhard, authors of the new book Self Evaluation and Psychotherapy in the Market System, want us to understand that.“What I would do is focus on the reality of the system which puts people in that kind of situation,” Glantz says of his work with Michael. “It has nothing to do with him.”Welcome to the new world of what might be called inequality therapy.In a hyper-capitalist world where advertising and financial pressures channel the drive for status into an obsession, no one can really win – even those who appear to have it all. Commerce infiltrates even the language we use to describe our deepest concerns: am I worth it? Am I valued? Do I count?This problem is exacerbated by the market system because, Glantz says, it values a particular type of identity, one based on “achievement rather than on belonging”.Inequality makes that harder to see as it unendingly promotes what psychologists call “materialistic values” that are harmful to mental and physical health. These involve prioritizing the pursuit of “money, status and image over things like family, spirituality, helping the community and just having fun”, says Tim Kasser, professor of psychology at Knox College and co-author of the book Hyper-capitalism: The Modern Economy, Its Values and How to Change Them.Kasser conducted a 2014 meta-analysis of hundreds of studies of materialistic values. Not a single one showed a positive relationship between material values and well-being. “The effect is almost always there and significant and basically always negative,” he says, noting that materialism is associated with less life satisfaction and happiness and more anxiety and depression. People who worry about status also drink more, smoke more and – natch – shop a hell of a lot more.Kasser notes that there are two important spurs for materialism, both of which are heightened by hyper-capitalism. The first is the most obvious: ads, movies, TV, other media, which constantly push consumerism. From the sociopathic level of consumerism exhibited by our current president and the reality show swamp from which he emerged to the Styles section of the New York Times, the trappings of wealth are exalted.But another, perhaps even more important factor, matters, too. And that is a sense of economic uncertainty, instability, precariousness or actual experience of low economic status. “When people grow up in a situation of threat or insecurity or are reminded of these things, they orient towards materialistic values,” Kasser says. Being deprived – or feeling that you soon will be – focuses the mind on money.And as we struggle to balance the need for love, friendship, family and financial security, hyper-capitalism weights the scales heavily in favor of putting gaining wealth first. We all know prioritizing relationships and values like compassion over money is healthier and more likely to lead to lasting happiness, but most of the messages we get suggest the opposite.For Michael, having permission to stop ruminating on his status helped break its hold over him. By observing the thoughts rather than engaging with their content, he began to gain distance from them. This – and some meditation and relaxation exercises – allowed him to be more attentive to his family. That broke the cycle of irritation and arguing that escalated stress. And by judging himself less, he became less judgmental about others.In the past, many therapies have had strongly political elements: consider the group therapies of the 1960s that urged people to liberate themselves from the restraints of the “straight” world or the 1970s “consciousness raising” of feminist psychotherapy. But as hyper-capitalism intensified through the 1980s, the focus narrowed almost exclusively to the self. This put the blunt of the blame for failure squarely on the inidual, even as the odds of rising economically and achieving the American dream fell sharply.As cases like Michael’s suggest, it is high time for an inequality therapy that doesn’t fault people for being crushed by an inhumane marketplace – but instead recognizes that it is the system, not the self, that is broken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38429d425b105a5e3a23032e5c112ebfef31932b/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee49aeeef1fa71e977fdb219d99648b","title":"age envy be happy everyone else perfect social media","story":"Social media has created a world in which everyone seems ecstatic – apart from us. Is there any way for people to curb their resentment?One night about five years ago, just before bed, I saw a tweet from a friend announcing how delighted he was to have been shortlisted for a journalism award. I felt my stomach lurch and my head spin, my teeth clench and my chest tighten. I did not sleep until the morning.Another five years or so before that, when I was at university, I was scrolling through the Facebook photos of someone on my course whom I vaguely knew. As I clicked on the pictures of her out clubbing with friends, drunkenly laughing, I felt my mood sink so fast I had to sit back in my chair. I seemed to stop breathing.I have thought about why these memories still haunt me from time to time – why they have not been forgotten along with most other day-to-day interactions I have had on social media – and I think it is because, in my 32 years, those are the most powerful and painful moments of envy I have experienced. I had not even entered that journalism competition, and I have never once been clubbing and enjoyed it, but as I read that tweet and as I scrolled through those photographs, I so desperately wanted what those people had that it left me as winded as if I had been punched in the stomach.We live in the age of envy. Career envy, kitchen envy, children envy, food envy, upper arm envy, holiday envy. You name it, there’s an envy for it. Human beings have always felt what Aristotle defined in the fourth century BC as pain at the sight of another’s good fortune, stirred by “those who have what we ought to have” – though it would be another thousand years before it would make it on to Pope Gregory’s list of the seven deadly sins.But with the advent of social media, says Ethan Kross, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan who studies the impact of Facebook on our wellbeing, “envy is being taken to an extreme”. We are constantly bombarded by “Photoshopped lives”, he says, “and that exerts a toll on us the likes of which we have never experienced in the history of our species. And it is not particularly pleasant.”Clinical psychologist Rachel Andrew says she is seeing more and more envy in her consulting room, from people who “can’t achieve the lifestyle they want but which they see others have”. Our use of platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, she says, amplifies this deeply disturbing psychological discord. “I think what social media has done is make everyone accessible for comparison,” she explains. “In the past, people might have just envied their neighbours, but now we can compare ourselves with everyone across the world.” Windy Dryden, one of the UK’s leading practitioners of cognitive behavioural therapy, calls this “comparisonitis”.And those comparisons are now much less realistic, Andrew continues: “We all know that images can be filtered, that people are presenting the very best take on their lives.” We carry our envy amplification device around in our pockets, we sleep with it next to our pillows, and it tempts us 24 hours a day, the moment we wake up, even if it is the middle of the night. Andrew has observed among her patients that knowing they are looking at an edited version of reality, the awareness that #nofilter is a deceitful hashtag, is no defence against the emotional force of envy. “What I notice is that most of us can intellectualise what we see on social media platforms – we know that these images and narratives that are presented aren’t real, we can talk about it and rationalise it – but on an emotional level, it’s still pushing buttons. If those images or narratives tap into what we aspire to, but what we don’t have, then it becomes very powerful.”To explore the role that envy plays in our use of social media, Kross and his team designed a study to consider the relationship between passive Facebook use – “just voyeuristically scrolling,” as he puts it – and envy and mood from moment to moment. Participants received texts five times a day for two weeks, asking about their passive Facebook use since the previous message, and how they were feeling in that moment. The results were striking, he says: “The more you’re on there scrolling away, the more that elicits feelings of envy, which in turn predicts drops in how good you feel”.No age group or social class is immune from envy, according to Andrew. In her consulting room she sees young women, self-conscious about how they look, who begin to follow certain accounts on Instagram to find hair inspiration or makeup techniques, and end up envying the women they follow and feeling even worse about themselves. But she also sees the same pattern among older businessmen and women who start out looking for strategies and tips on Twitter, and then struggle to accept what they find, which is that some people seem to be more successful than they are. “Equally, it can be friends and family who bring out those feelings of envy, around looks, lifestyle, careers and parenting – because somebody is always doing it better on social media,” she says. How much worse would it have been for Shakespeare’s Iago, who says of Cassio: “He hath a daily beauty in his life  That makes me ugly,” if he had been following his lieutenant on Instagram?While envying other people is damaging enough, “We have something even more pernicious, I think,” the renowned social psychologist Sherry Turkle tells me. “We look at the lives we have constructed online in which we only show the best of ourselves, and we feel a fear of missing out in relation to our own lives. We don’t measure up to the lives we tell others we are living, and we look at the self as though it were an other, and feel envious of it.” This creates an alienating sense of “self-envy” inside us, she says. “We feel inauthentic, curiously envious of our own avatars.”We gaze at our slimming, filtered #OutfitOfTheDay, and we want that body – not the one that feels tired and achy on the morning commute. We spit out the flavourless “edible” flowers that adorn our bircher muesli – not much of a #foodgasm in reality. We don’t know what to do with the useless inflatable unicorn when the Instagram Story has come to an end. While we are busy finding the perfect camera angle, our lives become a dazzling, flawless carapace, empty inside but for the envy of others and ourselves, in a world where black cats languish in animal shelters because they are not “selfie-friendly”.There is a different, even darker definition of the concept of envy. For Patricia Polledri, psychoanalytic psychotherapist and author of Envy in Everyday Life, the word refers to something quite dangerous, which can take the form of emotional abuse and violent acts of criminality. “Envy is wanting to destroy what someone else has. Not just wanting it for yourself, but wanting other people not to have it. It’s a deep-rooted issue, where you are very, very resentful of another person’s wellbeing – whether that be their looks, their position or the car they have. It is silent, destructive, underhand – it is pure malice, pure hatred,” she says.This can make it very difficult for envious people to seek and receive help, because it can feel impossible for them to take in something valuable from someone else, so strong is the urge to annihilate anything good in others and in themselves. She believes envy is not innate that it starts with an experience of early deprivation, when a mother cannot bond with her baby, and that child’s self-esteem is not nourished through his or her life.As a cognitive behavioural therapist, Dryden is less interested in the root causes of envy, focusing instead on what can be done about it. When it comes to the kind of envy inspired by social media, he says, there are two factors that make a person more vulnerable: low self-esteem and deprivation intolerance, which describes the experience of being unable to bear not getting what you want. To overcome this, he says, think about what you would teach a child. The aim is to develop a philosophy, a way of being in the world, that allows you to recognise when someone else has something that you want but don’t have, and also to recognise that you can survive without it, and that not having it does not make you less worthy or less of a person.We could also try to change the way we habitually use social media. Kross explains that most of the time, people use Facebook passively and not actively, idly and lazily reading instead of posting, messaging or commenting. “That is interesting when you realise it is the passive usage that is presumed to be more harmful than the active. The links between passive usage and feeling worse are very robust – we have huge data sets involving tens of thousands of people,” he says. While it is less clear how active usage affects wellbeing, there does seem to be a small positive link, he explains, between using Facebook to connect with others and feeling better.Perhaps, though, each of us also needs to think more carefully when we do use social media actively, about what we are trying to say and why – and how the curation of our online personas can contribute to this age of envy in which we live. When I was about to post on Facebook about some good career-related news recently, my husband asked me why I wanted to do that. I did not feel comfortable answering him, because the truth is it was out of vanity. Because I wanted the likes, the messages of congratulations, and perhaps, if I am brutally honest, I wanted others to know that I was doing well. I felt ashamed. There is nothing like an overly perceptive spouse to prick one’s ego.It is easy to justify publicising a promotion on Twitter as necessary for work, as a quick way of spreading the news to colleagues and peers. But as we type the words “Some personal news”, we could pause to ask ourselves, why are we doing this, really? Friends, family, colleagues – anyone who needs to know will find out soon enough with news that is quite personal, do we need to make it so public? Honing your personal brand on social media may seem good for business, but it does have a price. It all creates an atmosphere where showing off – whether unapologetically or deceptively – is not just normalised but expected, and that is a space where envy can flourish.I do not think the answer necessarily always lies in being more honest about our lives – it might sometimes lie in simply shutting up. Of course, raising awareness about previously hushed-up, devastating experiences of miscarriage or abuse or harassment can have the power to challenge stigma and change society. But ostensibly authentic posts about mindfulness, or sadness, or no makeup selfies are always designed to portray their poster in the best light.For Polledri’s concept of envy at its most noxious, there can be no upside. But as a less extreme emotional experience, it can serve a function in our lives. Dryden differentiates between unhealthy envy and its healthy form, which, he says, “can be creative”. Just as hunger tells us we need to eat, the feeling of envy, if we can listen to it in the right way, could show us what is missing from our lives that really matters to us, Kross explains. Andrew says: “It is about naming it as an emotion, knowing how it feels, and then not interpreting it as a positive or a negative, but trying to understand what it is telling you that you want. If that is achievable, you could take proper steps towards achieving it. But at the same time, ask yourself, what would be good enough?”When I reflect on those two moments of piercing envy that I cannot forget, I can see – once I have waded through the shame and embarrassment (so much for keeping the personal personal) – that they coincided with acute periods of unhappiness and insecurity. I was struggling to establish myself as a freelance writer and, before that, struggling to establish a social life after leaving home for university in a new city. Both of these things have improved as time has passed, but I do still feel unpleasant pangs of envy every now and then, whether I’m on social media or off it, and I see it among my friends and family. Perhaps in part it is because we do not know how to answer the question: “What would be good enough?” That is something I am still working on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf464a89117a4e8b14af206b48daeda5ac02bb0/0_291_4634_2780/master/4634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fda83fdcd568caae1f0c953f5fca5c40","title":"taylor swift instagram post endorsement democrats tennessee","story":"When pop megastar Taylor Swift praised two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee, she broke a years-long policy of keeping her politics to herself.Her endorsements drew much praise but also a fierce backlash. Some white supremacists who have formed an odd cult following around the singer cried betrayal, while some more mainstream fans said she should have stuck to her music.Criticism is nothing new for Swift, whose political silence has drawn just as much vitriol as her decision to speak out.In an Instagram post on Sunday night, Swift threw her support behind Phil Bredesen, candidate for Senate, and Jim Cooper for the US House.She wrote: “In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions. I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG.“I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.”Swift, 28, has previously stayed scrupulously neutral, frustrating many liberals. She has said that as a young woman whose expertise is in music, she does not feel right influencing her fans’ politics. “I don’t talk about politics because it might influence other people,” she told Time magazine six years ago. “And I don’t think that I know enough yet in life to be telling people who to vote for.”On the day of the 2016 election, she urged fans to vote but did not reveal how she would cast her own ballot. “Who is Taylor Swift voting for?” was a top search on Google.She inched closer to revealing a liberal orientation when she tweeted support for last year’s Women’s March, saying: “So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched. I’m proud to be a woman today, and every day.”That wasn’t enough for critics, who questioned why she didn’t attend. One writer called her comments a “craven” way of “reducing the political protest to a girl power party”.Swift’s public neutrality allowed fans to project views on to her. She developed a following among white supremacists, who held her up as the ideal of white femininity. The singer’s lawyers went after one blogger. Critics wondered why she wouldn’t publicly denounce neo-Nazi fans.Swift even sparked controversy with a short Instagram post marking her birthday at the end of 2017, where she said she “couldn’t have asked for a better year”. Those who saw little to celebrate in the first year of the Trump presidency begged to differ.So it was no surprise that Swift’s decision to finally wade into politics sparked backlash of its own. Those rightwing fans, for one, were incensed.“Oh yay! Another literally retarded celebrity the left can fawn over while we make fun of her and them for being retarded,” wrote one poster on the often-controversial online message board 4chan.Mainstream Republicans were also displeased, posting a response promising she would not be able to, in the words of one of her hits, “shake it off”.“If you haven’t heard, multimillionaire pop star Taylor Swift came down from her ivory tower to tell hardworking Tennesseans to vote for Phil Bredesen,” said the post by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Charlie Kirk, president of conservative group Turning Point USA, tweeted: “You just endorsed a Democrat in the Tennessee Senate race with a ridiculous statement saying Marsha Blackburn, a woman, is against women. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”Swift found support as well. Spinal Tap director Rob Reiner said on Twitter: “A big shout out to Taylor Swift for speaking out. You can single handedly change this country. Impress on your fans how critical and powerful their voices are. If you get them to the polls on Nov 6, everything you care about will be protected.”The Democrat also taunted his opponent with lyrics from Look What You Made Me Do, a hit on Swift’s last album, Reputation.Swift’s history with rapper Kanye West – who memorably interrupted her speech at an awards show and has become a prominent Trump supporter – also provided plenty of grist for delighted Democrats.Scott Dworkin, co-founder of the anti-Trump Democratic Coalition, wrote: “Taylor Swift just took the mic from Kanye.”Celebrity endorsements, however, do not always guarantee an edge. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was supported by Jay-Z and Beyoncé in Ohio, Bruce Springsteen in Pennsylvania and Jennifer Lopez in Florida. All three states went for Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5baf0b5e4b814b7bdc5cdc10910fc58f091732b2/0_0_2543_1526/master/2543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3169af037732270678fbbc1b9c8bdd9","title":"radiohead stevie nicks the cure 2019 rock and roll hall of fame nominees","story":"The Ohio institution will select its 2019 cohort at a ceremony in Brooklyn next MarchThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has revealed the list of nominees for induction into its 2019 cohort. Def Leppard, Devo, Janet Jackson, John Prine, Kraftwerk, LL Cool J, MC5, Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine, Roxy Music, Stevie Nicks, the Cure, Todd Rundgren, Rufus and Chaka Khan and the Zombies are all in consideration for the historic honour.Artists become eligible for selection 25 years after the release of their first record. An international voting committee of more than 1,000 artists, historians and members of the music industry will select five or six of these acts for induction into the Hall of Fame. Fans are also eligible to vote: the top five artists selected by the public will be tallied along with the committee’s votes.Radiohead were among 2018’s potential inductees, but declined to attend the ceremony. The band’s guitarist, Ed O’Brien, said at the time: “As a British band, it’s one of those things that it’s very lovely to be nominated, but we don’t quite culturally understand it. It’s a very American thing. Us Brits are very bad at celebrating ourselves.”It is likely to be welcome news to Def Leppard. In 2017, guitarist Phil Collen said it was “pathetic” that the English heavy metal band had yet to be nominated for the award. “We’re a rock band that sold 100 million albums, most of them, actually, in America,” Collen told Blabbermouth. “We’re a real rock band, we’ve been together for 30, or nearly 40 years, and the fact that that’s not recognised is kind of a bit weird.”LL Cool J was also nominated for the 2018 list. If the New York rapper is selected for the 2019 group, he will be the seventh hip-hop act to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, following Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, NWA and Tupac Shakur.If Stevie Nicks makes the 2019 class, it will mark her second induction to the Hall of Fame. She is a member of Fleetwood Mac, who were inducted in 1998. She would become the first woman to be inducted more than once. As of 2017, 22 male performers had been inducted twice or more, with Eric Clapton receiving three inductions – as a solo artist, with Cream and with the Yardbirds.The Zombies have been nominated multiple times. In 2017, keyboardist Rod Argent told Billboard that the psychedelic band would be “flattered, gratified and absolutely delighted” to be inducted. “I know there are some people that actually portray themselves as unaffected and don’t care and, ‘Oh, well, it would be nice, but, really I don’t get it. It’s not something that I particularly want.’ We’re not those people at all.”There are likely to be complaints from the US about the Hall’s perceived snubs – artists including Björk, Kate Bush, Roberta Flack, Whitney Houston, Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, the Monkees and Chic are considered overdue for induction. The ceremony holds great significance in the American music industry, but does not command similar significance in the UK.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame organisation was established by the late Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun in 1983. The museum opened in Cleveland, Ohio in 1986. That year, Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Fats Domino, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard and Elvis Presley became the first inductees. Aretha Franklin became the first female inductee in 1987. In 2018, Bon Jovi, the Cars, Dire Straits, the Moody Blues and Nina Simone were selected for induction.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2019 induction ceremony will be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, on 29 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5b1a470022fca3bdc23d2f6c8ad5eb936f5779a/761_607_4305_2583/master/4305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac4ffaf6ff706e70639a5df44cb28e47","title":"taylor swift pro democrat instagram post causes spike in voter registrations","story":"Musician says Marsha Blackburn’s Congress voting record ‘appalls and terrifies me’The US voter registration service has experienced a spike in numbers after Taylor Swift – long silent on partisan issues – expressed her support for two Democrat candidates and encouraged her 112 million Instagram followers to register to vote in time for next month’s US midterm elections.Kamari Guthrie, the director of communications for vote.org, told Buzzfeed News there were 65,000 registrations in the 24-hour period after the singer posted her statement to Instagram on Sunday.Swift focused her post on the Senate race in Tennessee, where she is registered to vote. She stated that although she had previously voted for women in office, she felt unable to support the Republican Senate candidate, Marsha Blackburn. “Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me,” she said, adding that she would be voting for the Democrat candidates Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.Of the 5,183 voter registrations in Tennessee this month, at least 2,144 occurred after Swift posted her statement to Instagram on Sunday, said Guthrie. The state’s deadline for voter registration is today, 9 October, which may also have contributed to the rush. There were 2,811 new Tennessee voter registrations in September.In her post, Swift affirmed her commitment to the fight for LGBTQ rights and described the “systemic racism” towards people of colour in the US as “terrifying, sickening and prevalent”. She encouraged her young fans to educate themselves on their local candidates and “vote based on who most closely represents your values”.Swift is performing her song I Did Something Bad at Tuesday night’s American Music Awards in Los Angeles. She has made few appearances at awards ceremonies since the release of her 2017 album, Reputation.

But what I would say is that we don’t know where this is going to end up. We are at a critical moment now. The ball is firmly back in the EU’s court we are waiting for them to respond,” she said.Mordaunt is one of two leave-voting cabinet ministers who have not yet delivered a public verdict on May’s Chequers plans. Her remarks, which will fuel leadership speculation, came as the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, prepared to face down mutinous Eurosceptic Conservative MPs in the House of Commons.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, the vice-chairman of the European Research Group of Brexit-backing MPs, said he believed at least 40 MPs were prepared to vote against the government if the EU agreed a Chequers-style deal.However, cabinet ministers have told the  they expect between 10 and 20 Brexiter rebels. May has also drawn up plans for a secret charm offensive aimed at persuading dozens of Labour MPs to back her Brexit agreement, the final elements of which are being thrashed out in Brussels.Mordaunt said: “I think we need to let the prime minister and her negotiating team get on with it and I’m supporting her in doing that, I think that’s in the national interest. So I’m not going to give a running commentary on that.”In a pointed remark at the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a potential leadership rival, and the former Brexit secretary David Davis, she said: “Other members of the cabinet felt that it was not the best way that they could support, but it was certainly my view that is the best way I can support.“All that matters is where we end up, what that agreement is, and I’m going to do everything I can to ensure that is the best deal possible.

These are colleagues who have contracts lasting as little as two months, outside of election time, and these are colleagues who have families and children to support. That isn’t working to live, that’s working to survive.”Short-term contracts are common for political campaigns and are regularly used by all political parties. Labour said its staff were fully unionised and there were regular discussions between senior management and staff representatives. A spokesman said: “Labour party employees are paid no less than a real living wage of £10 an hour and the party does not use zero-hours contracts.” A party source said employees would be encouraged to raise any concerns about working conditions, including those in financial difficulty who could receive advice and support from the party. It is understood there is no live official dispute between staff and management.The staffer, who works at the Labour national communications centre, said the situation was common for many people across the country but it “should not be the reality for our own staff, the bedrock of our movement.”Labour should be held to a higher standard, the staffer wrote, asking Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson, as well as MPs and trade unions, to take action.The staff member said many on short-term contracts were given only a few hours notice of when they were needed. “This isn’t Sports Direct. These are our brothers and sisters and they have families and kids to pay for,” they wrote.“Party staffers are relying on tax credits to make ends meet while fighting tirelessly for a Labour government for the many. Our employment is insecure but we believe workers should have the right to contracted hours that match the hours we regularly work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fc4d3704e1c6e4686f4d99b62bf8e5860371cd/0_117_4947_2968/master/4947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1550837d655fc1dff7dee4301d06713","title":"brexit international aid secretary penny mordaunt refuses to explicitly back mays chequers plan politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Dominic Raab’s statement to MPs about developments in the Brexit talksThere are three urgent questions in the Commons this afternoon.That means the Dominic Raab statement on Brexit probably won’t start until around 5.30pm.Last month the Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton, the party’s home affairs spokesman in the European parliament, wrote a lengthy blog explaining why he and his colleagues did not support the censure motion against Hungary. Here’s an extract.Contrary to what our political opponents and some in the media are trying to portray, this in no way signalled approval or support for any of the policies of the Hungarian governmentWe opposed it on the broad grounds that the resolution went way beyond the parliament’s competency and that the remedy it sought - article 7 can lead to a member state’s voting rights being withdrawn - was disproportionate and will never be applied because Poland has already pledged to veto it in the European council.More specifically, and just as importantly, we voted against the resolution because it will not work. Worse, it could make any subsequent legal moves against Hungary more difficult.We have always believed that if article 7 action is to be considered against a member state, it must be done in a legally sound way that specifically addresses legal incompatibility with EU law. That is a job for the European commission, as s of the treaty, following the correct legal process, not a resolution drafted by the Green group in the European parliament.This legal route has had proven success in the past, with the Hungarian government quietly changing several laws after the commission took action against it through the European court of justice. In contrast, there is no record of the Orban government backing down in the face of political pressure.In an article for the Daily  (paywall) Mark Harper, a former Conservative chief whip, says that Theresa May should push for a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU, because that is the only option she will be able to get through the Commons. He says:It is now very clear that the only realistic chance of getting a good Brexit deal through parliament is for it to have the support of Conservative and DUP MPs. The only option with a realistic chance of uniting those MPs, giving a chance of parliamentary approval, is a Canada-style free trade agreement (FTA).Harper’s intervention is interesting because he voted remain and, until now, he has not been seen as a potential Brexit rebel.May argues that a Canada free trade deal is unacceptable because it would not deliver full frictionless trade with the EU (meaning manufacturers dependent on just-in-time supply lines would suffer) and because it would create a hard border in Northern Ireland (meaning the EU backstop, creating a border in the Irish Sea, might have to come into force.) In his article Harper does not particularly address the frictionless trade point, but he writes at length about the Irish border, and argues that customs rules could be applied in Irleand without the need for extra border infrastructure.Although Tory Brexiters would vote for a Canada-style deal, there is no guarantee it would get through the Commons. Labour would oppose it, because it would not offer the same benefits as staying in the customs union and the single market, and the former home secretary Amber Rudd said recently that around 40 pro-European Tories would also refuse to back it.I’ve called Conservative HQ to ask for a response to the Hillary Clinton comments. (See 12.09am.) They say they’ll get back to me. We’ll see ...After the vote in the European parliament last month the party in London was slow to comment on the row, but it did eventually put out a statement defending the way its MEPs voted. It said:Victor Orban has a track record of responding to legal moves not political threats. Politicising the issue at this early stage simply undermines any future legal action, while boosting Orban’s domestic support.Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, has condemned the Conservative party for voting in the European parliament against measures to censure the Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán for his increasingly repressive policies. Speaking in Oxford this morning, she said:The slide towards autocracy is at least as graver threat to the European project as the financial crisis or Brexit. It is also a threat to Nato.UPDATE: Here is video of her comment.And here is the BBC’s Gareth Gordon on the DUP press conference.This is what Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted about his meeting with the DUP.And this is what the DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted about the meeting.Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has just posted this on Twitter. Is this a coded message about how she thinks the inhabitant of No 10 should refuse to budge?Mike Russell, Scotland’s constitutional relations secretary, has urged Scottish National party activists to bide their time on staging a new independence referendum, warning them that independence “isn’t just about grabbing a lifeboat in choppy and dangerous seas.”In an explicit and candid demand to remain patient about the timing of a new vote, Russell also hinted strongly there could be a long delay before Nicola Sturgeon decided on the optimum opportunity to stage that vote.He told delegates on the final day of the SNP’s annual conference in Glasgow the party needed to get the timing of the referendum and its arguments for leaving the UK perfectly framed. He said:Deciding the when can only come after agreeing on the why.Because the why isn’t just about grabbing a lifeboat in choppy and dangerous seas.At the weekend, about 20,000 hardline independence activists marched through Edinburgh, staging a rally on Holyrood park near the Scottish parliament despite a ban on the event by the conservation quango Historic Environment Scotland which runs the park.But Sturgeon is wrestling with a dilemma on whether to prioritise the SNP’s battle over Brexit or independence: she has made clear she needs to wait until the outcome of the Westminster vote on Brexit before deciding, and may even need to wait until the details of Brexit are finalised over the next two years.Russell, who is one of the most experienced SNP ministers in her team and has led Scottish government talks on Brexit with UK ministers, underscored that in his conference speech in Glasgow today. He said: I chose independence when I joined the SNP some 44 years ago and I intend to see it happen. I am still full of hope, and the more so when I look at how this party has changed and grown over all those years – and goes on growing.But it can only happen when we find the right moment and the right arguments to make it happen.Our job as a party and as a government is to both make sure that Scotland flourishes, no matter the circumstances but also to ensure that – at the right moment – the choice of independence can be made.The right moment – not the most comfortable moment nor the moment that best relieves our natural impatience. The moment at which our country is persuaded, ready and determined to win.The press conference still seems to be going on, but TV coverage has ended and I can’t find a live feed.Adam Boulton, who is presenting Sky’s All Out Politics, says that by the standards of the DUP, Arlene Foster sounded pretty conciliatory. What he means is that she did not come out with a straight no.Dodds says it has been agreed that the common travel area will continue.

Why is shuteye so important – and what happens if we don’t get enough?“The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness,” the Harvard sleep scientist Dr J Allan Hobson once joked. This isn’t quite true, but the questions of why we spend about a third of our lives asleep and what goes on in our head during this time are far from being solved.One big mystery is why sleep emerged as an evolutionary strategy. It must confer powerful benefits to balance out the substantial risks, such as being eaten or missing out on food while lying dormant. The emerging picture from research is that sleep is not a luxury but essential to both physical and mental health. But the complex and erse functions of sleep are only just starting to be uncovered.The brain doesn’t just switch off. It generates two main types of sleep: slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) – SWS – and rapid eye movement (dreaming), or REM.Eight hours is often quoted, but the optimum sleeping time varies between people and at different times of life. In a comprehensive review, in which 18 experts sifted through 320 existing research articles, the US National Sleep Foundation concluded that the ideal amount to sleep is seven to nine hours for adults, and eight to 10 hours for teenagers. Younger children require much more, with newborn babies needing up to 17 hours each day (not always aligned with the parental sleep cycle).However, the experts did not consider quality of sleep or how much was SWS v REM. Some people may survive on less sleep because they sleep well, but below seven hours there was compelling evidence for negative impacts on health. According to experts, too much sleep is also bad, but few people appear to be afflicted by this problem. In the UK the average sleep time is 6.8 hours.In the 1930s, an American scientist Nathaniel Kleitman spent 32 days 42m below ground level in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. The aim was to investigate the human body clock. Living in complete isolation, with no external cues of night and day, he adopted a 28-hour day. Despite sticking rigidly to a schedule of mealtimes, delivered in a bucket down a shaft, and bedtime, Kleitman failed to adapt and continued to feel awake only when his assigned “daytime” happened to coincide roughly with daytime in the outside world.His body temperature also continued to follow a cycle of close to 24 hours. Many shift workers – particularly those working irregular shifts – face similar problems. In recent years this issue has been taken more seriously, with professional sports teams taking on consultants about schedules for training and travel abroad. The US navy has altered its shift system to align it with the 24-hour clock, rather than the 18-hour day used in the old British system.Over millions of years of evolution, life has become deeply synchronised with the day-night cycle as our planet rotates. So-called circadian rhythms are evident in almost every life-form and are so firmly imprinted on our biological machinery that they continue even in the absence of any external input. Plants kept in a dark cupboard at a stable temperature open and close their leaves as though they can sense the sun without seeing it.In the 1970s, scientists uncovered a crucial piece of machinery for this internal molecular timekeeping. In experiments using fruit flies they found a gene, later given the name “period”, whose activity appeared to reliably rise and fall on a 24-hour cycle. Scientists, two of whom received Nobel prizes last year, later showed that the period gene worked by releasing a protein that built up in cells overnight, before being broken down in the daytime.Later, humans were shown to have the same gene, expressed in a tiny brain area called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This serves as a conduit between the eye’s retina and the brain’s pineal gland, which pumps out the sleep hormone melatonin. So when it gets dark, we get sleepy.The SCN clock is our body’s master timekeeper, but in the past decade, scientists have discovered clock genes are active in almost every cell type in the body, and the activity of roughly half our genes appears to be under circadian control.The activity of blood, liver, kidney and lung cells in a petri dish all rise and fall on a roughly 24-hour cycle, and virtually everything in our body – from the secretion of hormones to the preparation of digestive enzymes in the gut, from changes in blood pressure to body temperature – is influenced in major ways by what time of day these things are normally needed.Just how the ticking of each neuron is linked to the more complex brainwave rhythms that emerge in our brain during sleep is not yet clear, but scientists are investigating. When brain cells are grown in a dish in the lab they begin to self-organise and, somewhat unnervingly, start to show patterns of activity similar to those seen during sleep.Poor sleep is often seen as a modern problem, a blight of sedentary lifestyles and being glued to smartphones late into the night. However, research into the sleep patterns of modern-day hunter gatherers suggests this may paint an overly romantic view of the past. One study, of the Hadza people in northern Tanzania, found frequent night-time waking and widely differing sleep schedules between iniduals. Over a three-week period, there were only 18 minutes when all 33 tribe members were asleep simultaneously. The scientists behind the work concluded that fitful sleep could be an ancient survival mechanism designed to guard against nocturnal threats.The main difference appeared to be that tribe members were unburdened by paranoia and anxiety about sleep problems, which are a common cause of concern in western countries.In extreme cases, sleep deprivation can be fatal. Rats that are completely deprived of sleep die within two or three weeks. This experiment hasn’t been repeated in humans – obviously – but even a day or two of sleep deprivation can cause otherwise healthy people to suffer hallucinations and physical symptoms. After a poor night’s sleep, cognitive abilities take an immediate hit. Concentration and memory are noticeably affected and people are more likely to be impulsive and favour instant gratification over waiting for a better outcome. We are also worse people when we’re tired – one study found that sleep deprived people are more likely to cheat and lie.The reasons for some of these associations are complex and hard to separate from other lifestyle factors. The studies mentioned above attempted to filter out socioeconomic factors, for instance, but factors like stress and social isolation can be harder to capture. That said, there is growing evidence for a direct biological influence. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the body’s basic metabolism and the balance between fat and muscle mass.Insomnia has long been known as a common symptom of dementia, but some scientists also believe poor sleep could play a role in causing Alzheimer’s. Research has shown that the brain “cleanses” itself of beta-amyloid proteins linked to Alzheimer’s during sleep and that sleep deprivation causes the levels of these toxins to rise.The answer partly depends on what counts as sleep. Most scientists seem to go with the definition of (a) being immobile and (b) being significantly less responsive than when awake. Based on these criteria, there have been some candidates for sleepless species, but none has been conclusively shown to be true. The bullfrog was an early contender – a 1967 study found the frogs reacted similarly when given electric shocks in the daytime and middle of the night. But doubt has since been cast on this finding. There are animals that require little sleep: adult giraffes rarely sleep for more than five minutes at a time, while the little black bat is thought to sleep for 19 hours each day. And sleep is not the same for all animals. Dolphins have the ability to put only half their brains to sleep at a time, known as unihemispheric sleep. Migratory birds are thought to sleep-fly and sharks sleep-swim.The House of Sleep, Jonathan CoeOvercoming Insomnia and Sleep Problems, Colin EspieSleepfaring: A Journey Through the Science of Sleep, Jim HorneSleepyhead, Henry Nicholls"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8974563d31bf66fc2dfe90c8c7e2fb826eedeaf3/0_547_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=02d3ab41a8f2907a82219f636b683589 960w","title":"cyberchondria and cyberhoarding is internet fuelling new conditions","story":"More research is needed to understand new problems that may arise out of internet use, experts sayThe internet could be fuelling a rise in new conditions such as cyberchondria and cyberhoarding, experts have warned.While researchers say most internet use is benign, it can lead some people to develop problems. Now experts are calling for more research to understand the range of problems that exist, who might be at risk, and how iniduals can be helped.A new collaboration dubbed the European Problematic Use of the Internet Research Network will examine these and other internet-related health issues such as gambling, pornography and gaming.Among the issues they are hoping to explore are cyberhoarding – reluctance to delete information gathered online – and cyberchondria – compulsively using search engines and websites in the hope of finding reassurance about medical fears, only to self-diagnose further ailments.The problem, she said, is probably under-recognised. “I think it is more common than we realise,” she said. “I have seen it several times in my clinic.”Cyberhoarding, she added, is another problem researchers are planning to explore further. “Again, nobody knows the extent to which this is developing and causing problems,” she said. Fineberg said that at present it is unknown whether such problems are purely “digital versions” of analogue conditions. But, she said, the issue merits scrutiny.“Either that would enrich the diagnosis of these other disorders like hypochondriasis or there might even, depending on what we find, be an argument for creating even more new diagnoses,” said Fineberg.Writing in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacy, Fineberg – who chairs the network – and colleagues put forward a manifesto for research, noting much needs to be done to unpick the issues around problematic internet use, from defining different conditions to understanding whether they are addiction problems or, for example, are more akin to obsessive compulsive disorders.

You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.It is also unclear whether problems are short-term or chronic, while scales are needed to help researchers assess how severe an inidual’s condition is – and whether it is improving or getting worse with different treatments.“What we are interested in is starting to understand and perhaps identify who is vulnerable and perhaps can we do something to try to mediate and mitigate that vulnerability, and perhaps identify treatment options for that group earlier rather than later,” said Dr Valerie Voon from the University of Cambridge.Among the possibilities the team put forward was working with tech companies to find ways to flag people who might be at risk.“We are very interested in the concept of biomarkers, including digital biomarkers in other words, the pattern of your accessing the internet may allow us to detect whether or not you are going to turn out to be vulnerable or not,” said Fineberg, although she admits at present this is just a theoretical idea. One possibility she suggested was that sites could flag when you have spent several hours on them. Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, spokeswoman on behavioural addictions for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said it was important not to demonise activities like gaming, which the World Health Organization recently classified as a mental health condition. “It is not an epidemic, as some people worry about,” she said.But for those who develop a problem, she said the impact on finances, education, social life and relationships can be devastating – particularly for children, who can become “extremely pathological very quickly” after a serious life event such as the separation of parents. “But normally one would want to see a behaviour for a while before you take it seriously and decide to intervene,” she said.Prof Zsolt Demetrovics of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, a co-author of the new manifesto, stressed that spending even long periods of time on the internet, or using it to carry out what were once offline behaviours, is not necessarily harmful.He said: “Availability itself does not cause the problems … someone will not be a problematic internet user or a pornography addict just because it is more available.” The internet can also bring benefits, he added: “All these devices also mean that the possibility of help is also more available.”﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e49c76e7a6d3a090b12943e8c4975cd0aeb94b4/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec836ef9ff819f77dc81656335837d74","title":"kenneth olisa social mobility raise childrens aspirations","story":"Improving social mobility may sometimes seem like an uphill task in a time of rising inequality but Sir Kenneth Olisa, chair of the judging panel for the second year running at the UK Social Mobility awards which take place next week, says this is all the more reason to focus on levelling the playing field.The 66-year-old, who was knighted in 2018 for services to business and philanthropy, has had a string of roles from running his own merchant bank to lord-lieutenant of Greater London. In 2016 he was named by Powerlist as  the most influential black man in Britain. Olisa argues that creating better opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds like his should be a priority, including for business. People will tell you social mobility is a great idea, he says, “but just saying that and then not doing anything about it isn’t helpful.His own background – state-educated child of mixed race brought up by a single mother (his Nigerian father left while he was still young) in the 1950s, who went on to Cambridge – has informed his desire to promote inclusion and mobility. So, how does he respond to figures published last month showing that more than 14 million people live in poverty or research by the OECD showing that, far from improving, social mobility in the UK has stagnated?“I don’t consider that social mobility is a question of relative poverty andor earnings power. Earning more money isn’t a measure of social mobility, it’s a measure of earnings. You don’t have to be a high earner to have improved your social standing, indeed many important roles in our society, such as magistrates, aren’t paid,” says Olisa.The Social Mobility awards, set up by Tunde Banjoko, founder of the Making the Leap charity in 2017, are intended to incentivise organisations to break new ground in opening up opportunity. The commercial logic for having mobility as a target is clear, Olisa argues: finding the best talent is ultimately good for competitive advantage and the bottom line. “If you’re going to have a national football team you go to find the best football players. You don’t say, well let’s have people whose parents play football or who knows somebody that I know.” Most sports “dig deep into the talent pool” (at least at participant level) while business “is way behind that”.Asked if awards aren’t just tinkering around the edges of a big problem, he says that a major reason they are useful is the emphasis on organisations being able not only to demonstrate that they have strategies in place to widen the pool of talent they recruit from but also a plan for developing talent. Breaking down barriers by fostering ‘soft skills’ such as networking are also a way businesses can drive change he says.“Even now, if you went to a great public school and Oxford or Cambridge you’ve got a higher chance of getting into a top job than if you didn’t. And that isn’t a meaningful filter in the 21st century.”What about the government’s Social Mobility Commission? “I don’t quite understand what went wrong within the Social Mobility Commission but I very rarely heard anything from them,” he says. “They didn’t really say very much. They were all about data.” Asked whether he thinks the government is committed to fairness and social mobility, he replies: “Yes. But the answer doesn’t lie with legislators or regulators,” suggesting rather that, “it’s a matter of Darwinian principle that those who wish to survive and prosper will need to hire talented people from wherever they originate and not just people ‘who look like me’” .Olisa says that until his late 50s he would have said the colour of his skin was irrelevant. Only then did he realise the value of being a role model, not least for young people from minority ethnic backgrounds.Lives: London and Briantspuddle, Dorset.Family: Married, with two daughtersEducation: High Pavement grammar school, Nottingham Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (MA natural, social and political and management sciences).Career: 2006 – present: founding chairman, Restoration Partners 1993 – 2006: founding chairman, Interregnum plc 1981 – 1993: various senior marketing roles, Wang Labs UK 1974-1980: engineer, then salesman, then product marketing manager, IBM Systems.Interests: Photography, skiing, watching the River Piddle flow past the garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a60becdc5ac5fb11be3c49a71865fde81b1ddfc3/0_307_2884_1730/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c80dc31f635c06e95c54e29ce8cfde4","title":"slurs and stereotypes why us pro sports leagues lack asian american stars","story":"Jeremy Lin’s dominance of the NBA turned out to be brief. But athletes don’t need to play for huge teams to prove their worthI’ll always remember 14 February 2012, partly because it was my birthday but also because America was in the grip of Linsanity, a dazzling two-week period during which Jeremy Lin was one of the world’s best basketball players. That day, Lin hoisted up a three-pointer with time winding down against the Toronto Raptors.Yes, that game.\u0026nbspThe shot went in and, as Lin celebrated wildly with his teammates, I was enthralled. Players who looked like me weren’t supposed to be on NBA courts, let alone dominate them. For tens of thousands of kids like me around America, Lin’s emergence meant something.Injuries and an inevitable loss of form – even LeBron James would have struggled to maintain Lin’s level of play over those two weeks – means Linsanity feels like a distant memory. But it raises a question: will an Asian American superstar ever grace the spotlight in one of North America’s major sports league like Lin did? And perhaps this time for more than two weeks? The answer feels as complicated as the definition of “Asian American,” which varies from person-to-person, region-to-region. It’s important to understand the uniqueness of Lin’s rise to stardom. Based on the Linsanity coverage, it’s easy to see how befuddled the media and general public were about him – Asian American players are rare in North America’s four biggest leagues, the NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL. Insensitive Asian jokes became as commonplace as Lin’s heroics on the court, and it was easy to see how unprepared the US was for an Asian American superstar.\u0026nbspThough that shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise. Historically speaking, there have been so few Asian Americans within the Big Four that often their mere presence is news. Of course, there’s also the distinction between an Asian American player and an Asian player. Yao Ming, for example, was an NBA icon, but he is Chinese, not American.In answering where all the Asian Americans are, though, it gets tricky. The NCAA has a database to track the demographics of student-athletes in the US (it’s worth noting that the NCAA differentiates Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders from the Asian American category). The statistics are telling:\u0026nbspLooking at the raw data, especially among the Big Four sports at the collegiate level, Asian Americans are vastly underrepresented. And since, in football and basketball at least, college is the gateway to professional sports it’s easy to see why we’re still waiting for the next Lin. A number of factors need to be considered as to why Asian Americans aren’t playing in these popular sports. Some will point to the cultural differences they often deal with — especially looking at education and a propensity for hard work. As a second-generation Asian American, education was of the utmost importance at home and that was pounded into me. Sports took a backseat most of the time.Stereotyping is a real problem too it reminds me of when I played pick-up hoops at high school. Teenagers are ruthless and I’d hear far too often the dismal “small eyes” and “chopstick” jokes — which, in a basketball setting, make no sense anyway.\u0026nbspIt hardly encourages a young athlete to carry on playing – especially when some honestly believe Asian Americans just aren’t as athletic as other groups.Of course, away from the big pro sports leagues Asian Americans have had success. Chloe Kim was one of the stars of the 2018 Winter Olympics. She has charisma as well as skill and it was little surprise to see her gracing the cover of Sports Illustrated. The new US Open champion, Naomi Osaka, is a more fluid case. Her mother and father are Japanese and Haitian respectively but she grew up in America. With the 2020 Tokyo Olympics right around the corner, the spotlight will soon fall on her, and she will receive far more attention than she did after her US Open win, which was sadly overshadowed by controversy around Serena Williams’s clash with an umpire. And perhaps the examples of Kim, Osaka and male athletes like the uber-talented Nathan Chen show that success in the NFL or NBA isn’t everything. “Asian American” is an all-encompassing term and should be treated as such. An Asian American athlete doesn’t necessarily have to be a clone of Lin — East Asian, male and playing for a huge pro sports team — \u0026nbspto be a star."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c91b9927490529f696ca3d513ffe4f31df07140/0_575_1333_799/master/1333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39033a4fa0e965b0fb64773b32d67432","title":"sri lanka magical 1996 morgan england odi the spin","story":"As England and Sri Lanka prepare to face off in the five-match one-day series starting on Wednesday in Dambulla, a warm-up of sorts for the World Cup now less than eight months away, it feels the right time to stumble backwards 22 years, to one of cricket’s greatest stories.On 17 March 1996, in the sultry atmosphere of Lahore’s Gadaffi Stadium, Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lanka’s captain, lifted the World Cup high into the air. No one could quite believe it. Sri Lanka, the baby brother of the Asian block, the international whipping boy, had popped out of the hat, brandishing a party popper, a grin and a new kick-ass way of playing the game.Even by the standards of the time, when money wasn’t swilling around cricket to the same extent that is now, the Sri Lanka team were a rag-tag bunch. They numbered an assortment of part-time salesmen and clerical workers, many who couldn’t afford more than one pair of shoes each, and whose own cricket board was so broke that it had to rely on sponsors answering desperate pleas for donations to keep the whole thing from going under. Sri Lanka, only 14 years into their Test career, seemed to be going nowhere fast.Moreover, they had just returned from a tumultuous tour of Australia, where they were resoundingly thrashed, relentlessly sledged, had to cope with accusations of ball-tampering (a charge the ICC later dropped) and the umpire Darrell Hair calling their young spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing at the MCG on Boxing Day. On top of that, the country was still in the throes of civil war and, with just weeks to go before the start of the World Cup, which Sri Lanka was cohosting with Pakistan and India, a huge bomb went off in Colombo, killing 91 people and injuring more than a thousand. West Indies and Australia immediately withdrew from their games due to be held on the island.And yet, and yet … the show went on. Sri Lanka were awarded the forfeited matches but they won every match they played anyway, with a magic cocktail of pinch-hitting openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, potent spinners, including a young Murali, a powerful middle order and bucket loads of confidence force-fed to them by their swaggering, confrontational, controversial, cock-of-the-walk captain Ranatunga. In the opening rounds, there was an easy win over Zimbabwe before India were given a hiding, despite a century from Sachin Tendulkar, and then, against Kenya, a revolution: Sri Lanka hit 398 for five – a World Cup record that lasted 11 years and is still the fifth highest total in the tournament.They moved on to thrash England in the quarter-final, passing their score with nine overs and two balls to spare. In the semi-finals they were awarded the semi-final by default when, with India on the brink of defeat, the Eden Gardens crowd rioted in disgust. In the final, they won the toss, inserted Australia, and ked them by seven wickets. As Telford Vice memorably wrote: “It marks the spot on the map of cricket’s journey through history where East looked West in the eye and did not blink. Instead, East winked and said: ‘Try to keep up.’”However, you can’t live on fairytales, and as this next World Cup approaches, the upper hand lies elsewhere – with a plumper, better-resourced nation. Most remarkably, to those who have watched England’s recent World Cup campaigns through barely perceivable cracks between their fingers, it lies here, with Eoin Morgan’s side, who will have home advantage in trying to win England men’s first 50-over World Cup.The winloss ratio of both countries since that quarter-final meeting back in 1996 is fairly even, Sri Lanka have won 313 of 609 one-day international matches and England 231 of 469. But break the figures down further and you see how the two sides’ stock has changed.Since the 2015 World Cup when England disastrously failed to make it out of the preliminary stages, and Sri Lanka were knocked out in the quarter final, England have won 48 matches out of 72 Sri Lanka 22 of 71 – including losing 30 out of 40 since January last year. England are now ranked the No 1 ODI team in the world Sri Lanka lie eighth.Sri Lanka come into the series on pitches that should favour them, fresh from a humiliating experience in the Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, where they were booted out in the first round after defeats by Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Angelo Mathews was asked to relinquish the captaincy for “fitness” reasons. When he refused, he was sacked. The team is raw, unsettled, and has found it difficult to soak up the retirements of Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan – three of the four leading Sri Lankan ODI run-scorers of all time.England, on the other hand, are flying, fresh from a 2-1 ODI victory in the summer over their nearest rivals, India. In the aftermath of the 2015 World Cup they ripped up the manual, sacked the coach, dispatched a few players to the IPL – and just became better in every area. Now they have attacking openers, a powerful middle order, talented late-order hitting, good spinners and no fear – Ranatunga’s 1996 manual still proving its worth today.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Here are six players well worth keeping an eye on in this year’s tournament.Tough, uncompromising back-row forwards are precisely what Eddie Jones has been searching for since he became England’s head coach. The former Sale and Bath forward Fearns is now happily based in France and has spent the last year recovering from a serious knee injury but, once the 29-year-old has more comeback minutes under his belt, this could be the season he reminds people on both sides of the Channel of his no-nonsense value. With the excellent Australian Liam Gill also lending a classy edge to Lyon’s pack, the Top 14 side could make as lively an impression on their tournament debut – against Cardiff on Saturday – as La Rochelle did last year.Everyone had an opinion regarding Carbery’s – and Irish rugby’s – dilemma last season. If he wanted to be Johnny Sexton’s successor as fly-half for the national team he simply had to play at 10 on a regular basis and a high-profile switch from Leinster to Munster was ultimately the upshot. The colour of the jersey may now be different but the 22-year-old’s obvious talent remains if Munster are to nudge Leinster out of the winners’ circle they need Carbery to be at the forefront of that resurrection, particularly if their other guiding light, Conor Murray, remains sidelined. Alert, elusive and smart, Carbery will earn immediate love from Munster’s “Red Army” if he can help mastermind Exeter’s downfall at Sandy Park on Saturday.Eddie Jones loves a powerful winger and, at almost 18 stone and 6ft 3in tall, the 20-year-old Cokanasiga has all the physical credentials to make a serious impact in this year’s pool stages. He is not yet the finished article but an England cap could materialise this season if he continues his eye-catching early form for Bath. He has three tries in five league starts since signing from London Irish and, with Semesa Rokoduguni on the other wing, will give Toulouse’s defence an early test of their resolve at the Rec this Saturday.Leinster are defending champions and, scarily, have the capacity to improve further. In Ringrose they have a properly class centre for whom the next 12 months could be life-changing if he manages to stay fit and sparkles in Brian O’Driscoll’s old No 13 shirt. Last season, injury-wise, was occasionally frustrating but both province and country know there is lots more to come from a 23-year-old who should have made the 2017 Lions squad. A spectacular opening night at Dublin at Wasps’s expense would be a good place to start for a player with the balance, pace and attitude to be an Irish great.Hardly a left-field choice but put yourself in Russell’s position for a second: new club, new overseas life, new challenge. If anyone is going to make Saracens and Leinster think twice at the pointy end of this season’s tournament it is probably Racing, who were slightly unlucky not to sneak past Leinster in May’s final in Bilbao, and Russell has been handed the keys to the Parisian dream machine. If the Scot fires, his team will romp through Pool 4 unchallenged if he suffers one of his occasional blowouts, not least at Parc y Scarlets this weekend, a very different script could unfold. This is Russell’s chance to demonstrate he is a sufficiently good fly-half to fill the now-departed Dan Carter’s golden boots.One of the abiding images of last season was the beaming smile on the face of the former England head coach Andy Robinson after the Blues’ spectacular Challenge Cup final victory over Gloucester. His son, Olly, has thrived since moving across the Severn Bridge from Bristol and no less an authority than Sam Warburton, the now-retired Wales and Lions captain, has suggested he should be on England’s radar. With Saracens occupying the same pool as the Blues this is the 27-year-old’s moment to measure himself against the Vunipola brothers, Maro Itoje, Michael Rhodes et al and back up Warburton’s judgement. Given the Blues have not featured in Europe’s elite tournament for five years, he will not be alone in wanting to prove a point.With a host of potentially tight European games looming, let’s just run through the drop-goal stats from the leading fly-halves in Britain and Ireland. Of the Premiership 10s, George Ford, Owen Farrell, Gareth Steenson, Toby Flood, Danny Cipriani and Lima Sopoaga have yet to land a solitary one between them this season. Cipriani last kicked one domestically almost three years ago. Johnny Sexton, despite his famous effort to beat France in Paris last season, hasn’t kicked one in the Pro1214 for Leinster since 2012-13. The stats now suggest a drop goal is attempted only once every 10 games or so, with the focus having shifted to trying for seven points rather than three. All well and good but there will be days, particularly as winter draws in, when a drop of magic à la Ronan O’Gara or Jonny Wilkinson comes in very handy.It is a sign of the times that several of European rugby’s more evocative names – Clermont Auvergne, Stade Français, La Rochelle, Bordeaux-Bègles, Ospreys, Harlequins, Northampton– are in the Challenge Cup this season. Clermont, beset by injuries last season, just happen to be the Top 14’s early leaders, with Stade currently in second. The rest of the field may well have to dig deep to prevent a French team winning this year’s tournament – which carries with it the prize of automatic qualification for next year’s Champions Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f646004b8ae9cb5ce2bbd9539d00bb8711d6b64a/0_200_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=132f3d0546b812e0442d930ea8d03977","title":"talking horses tattersalls sale set to bring blockbuster yearlings","story":"Prices were buoyant at the Goffs Orby sale last week, thanks in part to the arrival in the market of Phoenix ThoroughbredsNewmarket takes centre stage in the Flat racing world this week – first with the exclusive Tattersalls Book 1 sale over the next three days, and then with two days out top-class juvenile racing at the Future Champions meeting.Prices were buoyant, to say the least, at the Goffs Orby sale last week, which is the Irish equivalent of Book 1, thanks in part to the arrival in the market of another major new player in the shape of Phoenix Thoroughbreds. Phoenix describes itself as a “global racing and bloodstock investment group”, and bought the two top lots at the sale, both fillies by Galileo, for €3.2m (£2.8m) and €2m (£1.75m). In both cases, the underbidder who eventually cried enough was none other than MV Magnier, bidding on behalf of his father John’s Coolmore Stud operation.\u0026nbspThe first potential blockbuster yearling to look out for today is Lot 103, a filly full sister to Ten Sovereigns, the recent winner of the Group One Middle Park Stakes. Lot 120, a colt by Dubawi out of the 1,000 Guineas winner Sky Lantern, is also likely to attract plenty of interest, but pretty much every yearling led into the ring could conceivably end up fetching a big price if two or three of the major players decide to take an interest.\u0026nbspThe racecourse action may well prove to be relatively tame by comparison, but Allegiant (3.30) should be good enough to defy top weight in the one-mile handicap at Brighton. He has a penalty to carry after winning at Epsom on Sunday but he crossed the line with plenty in hand and will once again have Silvestre de Sousa doing the steering.\u0026nbspKatabatika (4.35) could be worth chancing later on the card to translate good recent form on the all-weather back to the turf, while Reeves (2.35) has shown promise in three of his four starts so far and may have been let in lightly on his handicap debut at Catterick.

Orsino’s yearning for his hoity-toity neighbour (“She’s still in mourning, she’s unwilling to date”) has little desperation Viola’s sexual predicament in arousing Olivia’s passion is summed up in her cry of “Oh, shit” and the climax suggests we are back in the hippy-dippy 60s world of Hair. “If we open our hearts to each other, what a better world it could be,” the chorus sing at the end. The sentiments are admirable, but this is no substitute for Feste’s “The wind and the rain”, which beautifully captures the evanescence both of theatrical performance and life itself.But the good things about the show are very good indeed. Malvolio is hilariously played by Gerard Carey as a smug git who whizzes about the streets on an electrified scooter. Even if, in the letter-reading scene, we don’t get to see much of the eavesdroppers’ reactions, it still becomes an excuse for a rousing top-hat-and-cane number in which Malvolio sees himself as a tap-dancing star. The excellent Gabrielle Brooks also nods towards Viola’s sexual confusion in a number where she alternates between jacketed boy and blouse-wearing girl, and there are beguiling performances from Natalie Dew as a sexually eager Olivia and Melissa Allen as an accordion-playing Scottish Feste.Taub’s songs add to the sense of gaiety: the nocturnal carousal of Sir Toby and his fellow topers is turned into a number, You Are the Worst, in which each member of the party is singled out for jovial abuse with Malvolio being the final victim. The songs also give scope to the strong community chorus who execute Lizzi Gee’s choreography with absolute precision: they include, in a welcome touch, a handful of seniors and are ultimately indistinguishable from the professionals.I still miss Shakespeare’s ability to intertwine comedy and tragedy: the exquisite pathos of Sir Andrew’s “I was adored once too” goes for nothing, and the rapid pairing-off at the show’s conclusion, with even the disgraced Sir Toby and Maria joining in the revels, gives no hint of the implicit strangeness of the situation. It also seems odd, in the midst of modern Notting Hill, for a sword-brandishing Antonio to announce “I was once in a sea-fight with the duke Orsino.” But, all cavils aside, the show gets Kwei-Armah’s Young Vic regime off to a festive, celebratory start. After the cakes and ale, I wait impatiently for the more substantial fare to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea63d21835c9ab63ac91be8b3f80f2fdad1115d/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2d08ab21b1f3c31035b2d3f53b69dba","title":"uber uk strike users urged not to cross digital picket line","story":"Union asks public not to use app during national 24-hour strike by driversUber customers are being urged not to cross a “digital picket line” on Tuesday during the first coordinated national strike by British drivers with the app-based service.The 24-hour strike starts at 1pm and there will be protests by drivers outside the company’s offices in London, Birmingham and Nottingham.The action is part of a push to unionise the gig economy. Last week, employees of companies including McDonald’s, Wetherspoons and TGI Fridays took part in an unprecedented joint national strike.Those involved are calling for the swift application of a 2016 tribunal judgment that rejected Uber’s classification of a group of drivers as independent contractors. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, retweeted the UPHD’s announcement of the industrial action and said: “I support this strike for better employment rights and urge others to respect the app picket line.”Stephen Hull, a Birmingham-based driver taking part in Tuesday’s strike, said: “There is mass discontent among drivers because the oversupply of vehicles and the way that drivers earn their money is making it almost impossible to make enough to live.”Hull, who has been driving for Uber for three and a half years, said it had initially been a good experience thanks to bonuses for hitting targets. “Then they would start to phase out the promotions and it just got harder and harder.”It is no longer his main source of income. “If I was to rely on Uber, I would be working 12 hours a day, six days a week to be able to make enough to survive. A majority of drivers are unhappy about this but many are scared because they are taking on a multinational company who don’t have to give you a reason for deactivating you.”James Farrar, the chair of the UPHD, said: “After years of watching take-home pay plummet and with management bullying of workers on the rise, workers have been left with no choice but to take strike action. We ask the public to please support drivers by not crossing the digital picket line by not using the app during strike time.”Uber said: “We are always looking to make improvements to ensure drivers have the best possible experience and can make the most of their time driving on the app.“That’s why over the last few months we’ve introduced dozens of new features, including sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections. An academic study last month found that drivers in London make an average of £11 an hour, after accounting for all of their costs and Uber’s service fee.“We continue to look at ways to help drivers increase their earnings and our door is always open if anyone wants to speak to us about any issues they’re having.”Uber is continuing its legal appeal against the 2016 ruling, which decreed that its drivers were not self-employed and should be paid the “national living wage”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86f1ee546363c352eced82c240630b1b1993b09e/905_274_3991_2394/master/3991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48fb5ebb85d1bf5c7cdbe69de68e7f40","title":"wolf watching holiday belarus wilderness forest","story":"Deep in the vast enchanting forest, visitors track endangered wolves with a zoologist passionate about their survivalDawn in the Naliboki forest: mist over the marshes and bats skittering in birch trees. Above the clearing, stars are fading into a pale sky. We’re in deepest God-knows-where in one of Europe’s largest wild forests. Zoologist Vadim Sidorovich crouches in the half-light studying the track I’m barely breathing, so intense is the silence. A brown bear, Vadim says. He traces a finger over the prints of its front paws, and – two ovals – its back paws. I can see the claw marks. A dozen bears roam this part of the forest.But we’re not really here for bears: 30 minutes later we’re gazing at a meadow haloed in golden light, with roe deer grazing in long grass. This is wolf territory. The 2,000 sq km Naliboki, in central Belarus, also has one of the world’s highest densities of lynx, elk, bison, storks and eagles. Tour operator Explore’s new long weekend to Belarus, however, is all about wolves.After a day in the capital, Minsk, visitors spend two nights with Vadim and his family – research assistant wife Irina, their children and their dogs, one a half-breed wolf – at a forest eco-station. It feels like the home of a fairytale woodsman, with handmade terracotta tableware and furnishings made of pine logs. Wifi? Even the mobile reception is sketchy. “I like peasant life,” Vadim says. “People in this forest two centuries ago were happier than a billionaire.”A former university professor, Vadim quit academia 15 years ago for research in the Naliboki. (His blog, Zoology by Vadim Sidorovich, is interesting if niche reading.) Wolves are his speciality. Around 40 migrate into the forest from late September to breed, quadruple that number by late January. Shy, nocturnal and swift, wolves make elusive subjects – part of their fascination, I guess. For Vadim, “to see one is God’s gift”. That afternoon, we walk deep into the mossy forest. As we peer into abandoned dens, Vadim chats about wolves as if they are old friends: why a mother rotates cubs between 30 or so dens how most cubs are killed by lynx, which see wolves as competitors that pack members take turns to cub-sit.We’re en route to his motion-activated cameras. Vadim’s hoping for images of a wolf and her cubs that he’s been tracking – each year fewer wolves breed here. I’m hoping to quell a creeping unease. Brooding, preternaturally still, the forest has closed around us.In western Europe, huge, dense forests come loaded with terror – like Red Riding Hood or Hansel and Gretel, you enter at your peril. In Belarus, they see forests differently: the Naliboki is a larder stocked with berries and mushrooms. It’s also a refuge, where second world war partisans hid when Belarus was crushed between Russian and German troops.It still is a refuge, really. Vadim says: “For me, the forest is like home for a child. It is a warm feeling. Here, you forget about authorities. You live like the grasses grow.”By the end of my stay I’m not sure who needs the Naliboki more – the wildlife or him.After two hours we reach the cameras. Images show a bear crossing a stream, a lynx on a fallen trunk, an elk and her calf, a truffling wild boar and there, finally, a silver-brown wolf, trotting away. But no cubs. Vadim is worried that the forest no longer supports cubs. On successive jeep safaris we see capercaillie, foxes, deer, white cranes and storks, and all kinds of raptors. Vadim points out a tree scratched by wolf claws. But cubs? No sign.On our last evening, Vadim leads me alongside a swampy channel. You can tell that bison are close: grass where they’ve rolled looks like it’s been rotovated trees are tufted with black hair where they’ve scratched. There’s a hot, musky animal stink. As we turn a corner there’s a rumble of hooves and the snapping of branches as something large smashes away. It stops. Among the trees, I can make out two bison staring at us. It’s magical, like something from a dream or a myth.A bit like the Naliboki itself, in fact. Back in Minsk, it seems implausible that so distinct a world exists. If this trip has a problem it’s that it’s pitched as a wolf-watching holiday. Fail to see one and you might leave disappointed. Yet the Naliboki is a transformational place. Out there in mobile-free God-knows-where, days swell, and silent, inky nights thrill. To stay a while is to realise that life’s pauses are as enriching as its adventures.There’s an email waiting for me in Minsk. It’s from Vadim – a photo from that motion-camera. I click it open. In a pretty birch clearing stand two wolves – and around them a litter of 10 gambolling cubs.

Does it succeed?At first glance, Butterfly, which starts later this month on ITV, uses a well-worn mainstream drama set-up. Vicky, played by Anna Friel, is an amiable but troubled mum who lives in an airy, pleasantly middle-class semi. Her career plans are uncertain, her mother (Alison Steadman) is a judgmental hindrance, and her estranged husband (Emmett J Scanlan) has started picking up their two kids for the weekend with his new girlfriend waiting in the car.All that is thrown into relief when the beginning of secondary school finally prompts the family’s younger child, Max (Callum Booth-Ford), to publicly identify as Maxine, after years of wearing girls’ clothes at home (this, we learn, is the reason Dad left). With Friel the supportive parent who isn’t sure how to protect her child, and Scanlan the father whose ignorance manifests as aggressive denial, Butterfly is a new addition to a resolutely unglamorous genre: the issue-led drama that aims to break down prejudice and ignorance. The question mark hanging over any such project being whether it can be dramatically compelling as well as a force for social good: can it entertain as well as educate?Like the debate around trans rights and equality, the number of trans characters on TV has increased in the past few years. Emmerdale is the latest soap to introduce a trans storyline, with the addition in June of Ash Palmisciano as Matty, formerly known as Hannah. Boy Meets Girl became the BBC’s first comedy with a trans lead performer, Rebecca Root, in 2015. In the US, where Orange Is the New Black’s Laverne Cox became the first trans actor to be nominated for an Emmy in 2014, the Ryan Murphy drama Pose this year featured a cast dominated by trans performers, while the process of transitioning itself has been tackled by the trailblazing Transparent.“Popular media has often portrayed trans people as objects of horror, disgust or as victims,” says the writer, film-maker and non-binary trans campaigner Owl Fisher. “Only in recent years have we started to see trans people represented positively and our real issues and struggles brought forward.”Butterfly breaks ground by directly addressing children transitioning. “Trans youth are such a vulnerable group and there are many misconceptions around them,” says Fisher. “That’s why Butterfly is massively important: it is authentic representation that humanises us as opposed to demonising us.”ITV’s three-parter is written by Tony Marchant, a veteran of socially aware TV whose CV includes The Mark of Cain, Public Enemies, Swallow and Kid in the Corner. Marchant forged his scripts after observing meetings organised by Mermaids, a charity that supports gender-erse and transgender children and young people, and consulting with clinical psychologists at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust.“It is mainly dads who struggle, particularly with kids who identify as female,” agrees Susie Green, CEO of Mermaids and a consultant on Butterfly.Marchant’s latest work, in other words, fits in with the theme of toxic or fragile masculinity that has run through his whole career. Indeed, it is the fuel for so many acclaimed dramas of box-set TV’s golden age, from The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire to Mad Men and Dexter. “Men are very caught up in their male identity,” Marchant says, “and where they feel they are when they judge themselves against other men. It’s a problem, still, for men to own up to their vulnerabilities and insecurities.”Along with the problem of unsympathetic dads, Butterfly confronts another, more controversial, point: the claim that kids exhibiting signs of gender dysphoria are pushed into transitioning. The show is careful to reflect how emotionally fraught the process is there was no question of casting a trans child actor as Maxine because, according to Green, “it would have forced them to go back to the person they were living as prior to transition: to relive something that was inevitably very painful for them.“Unfortunately the press gives this impression of children being fast-tracked down a medical route, which isn’t the case,” adds Green. “That’s why Butterfly is so important, it demonstrates that that doesn’t happen.”“The idea,” says Marchant, “that children are being led down the road of a trans identity – there are parallels between that kind of scaremongering and the idea that we were propagandising our children with a gay sensibility 20 years ago.”But does Butterfly work as drama? Watching episode one in particular, the viewer is aware of a checklist of points being ticked off, and of characters serving as avatars for the various voices commonly heard. School bullies appear on cue there’s a scene featuring the perhaps over-vexed question of which public (or in this case, school) toilets to use and Alison Steadman’s character personifies the stereotype of an older generation who initially just don’t get it.The primary-colour storytelling palette is, however, intentional. Marchant envisages a family audience, who presumably will watch on catchup since moments of Butterfly are too shocking to air before 9pm. “First, it would be kids going through this, with or without the support of their parents. It’s a positive, affirming message. Then I’d hope it would be parents who aren’t coping with it. After that, maybe just kids with any sort of difference, and their parents. Some sense of: this is what we need to do, this is OK.”A vivid illustration of the trap to avoid when trying to make issue-led drama edgy is 13 Reasons Why, a US series about a teenager who kills herself, leaving cassette recordings behind to explain her actions. It led to hundreds of critiques with the word “problematic” in the headline – the Washington Post described it as “remarkably, even dangerously, naive in its understanding of suicide” – because its melodramatic tone ended up glamorising suicide as a grand gesture of defiance and revenge. The show was so keen to be eventful and explicit that it became overly traumatising, particularly in the even more heavily criticised second season, which featured a rape and a school shooting in upsetting scenes that didn’t seem to have a solid dramatic purpose.British primetime’s naturally more prosaic tone, which dates back to Cathy Come Home, the original issue-driven drama in 1966, is safer ground. The best modern yardstick for Butterfly might be The A Word, which nailed the tricky balance between busting social taboos – in that case, about the challenges of bringing up an autistic child – and being an engaging drama.“The A Word is about communication,” says Lucy Richer, senior commissioning editor for BBC Drama and the show’s executive producer. “It doesn’t pigeon-hole itself as a disability drama. It’s about giving voice to those who might not otherwise be heard, but it tells a relatable story about family. It’s not a drama about autism, it’s a much wider piece, but it feels fresh. Stories about difference should feel fresh, exactly because they’re not familiar.”The A Word was a medium-sized hit for BBC One, bringing in more than 4 million viewers for last year’s second season. TV is waking up to the fact that audiences are receptive to shows about families coping with difficult or unusual challenges. BBC Four, for instance, has just finished filming There She Goes, starring David Tennant and Jessica Hynes as the parents of a nine-year-old with severe learning disabilities. Such shows can, if done well, comfort and empower those in a similar situation, while moving and enlightening viewers who aren’t.“I think it just reflects an appetite from people to experience lives that might be different to theirs,” Richer says. “They’re fundamentally about families, and we’ve all grown up in families of different shapes and sizes. It reflects a really open-minded, interested attitude towards understanding experiences. That’s what telly should be doing.” If Butterfly suffers the odd dramatic stumble on its way to passing that test, perhaps it’s a sacrifice worth making.Butterfly starts on ITV on 14 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d092ed99854339b41f92e3ba30e4011ddb651417/0_142_4729_2840/master/4729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c1c51c5a1176a520a53012ff68ddcd","title":"the circle finale how channel 4s dating show won me over","story":"The ‘social experiment’ has been one of the standout TV shows this year. But did its catfishing winner deserve the spoils?Televised reality competitions occur on a spectrum. At one end of the spectrum is Love Island, which is gaudy, unoriginal and deliberately about as low stakes as you can get. At the other is The Circle, an out-and-out social experiment that primarily seeks to ask important questions about who we are and how technology alters our behaviour. There’s another big difference between these two shows, of course. People liked Love Island.OK, that’s unfair. It might have been the case when the series began three weeks ago, when the simultaneous bombardment of rules and idiots meant that it was met with little more than a shrug. No doubt this caused at least one person at Channel 4 to rationalise The Circle as at least being better-performing than their last big reality competition, Eden, purely on the basis that it stayed on television for more than a single episode.But then something odd happened people started catching up online as the series wore on. They heard about The Circle from their one friend who was into it, then slowly went about bingeing all the episodes on All 4, the same way they would with a flashy drama. Suddenly its initially dull premise – strangers sit in flats, guessing at the true identity of their unseen neighbours – became something approximating must-see TV.What’s great about The Circle’s success is that it always seemed slightly too cerebral to truly fly. From the outside, it looked like a parable about the importance of personal caution in the digital age, a sort of Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water for Snapchatters. These issue-based shows tend to make for interesting thinkpieces – which, incidentally, is the worst thing you can ever say about a terrible programme – but over time the humanity of the contestants won out.Everyone will have their favourite contestants – two big fan favourites were Scotty and Freddie, who embarked upon a truly life-affirming friendship during their time on the show – but I think the fulcrum of the entire series was Dan. Dan, being equal parts horny and gullible, essentially stood as an analogue for the typical internet user. He was fooled time and time again by the identity-masking tricks of his fellow contestants, but always managed to somehow push through on the strength of his boner alone. Until last night’s finale, Dan’s most awkward highlight was coming face-to-face with Mairead, a fiftysomething catfisher he had been sexting in the belief that she was 30 years younger than she was.And then he met Alex, who had spent his time on the show posing as a woman named Kate. It was the most overt deception of the series. Dan, it’s easy to assume, fell in love with Kate during his time on The Circle. So, when he was confronted by a bloke standing in her place, his hurt was impossible to mask. Alex called Dan “mate”. Dan snapped back: “Don’t call me mate”, stung by his own gullibility for the millionth time. It was gripping.Alex won, by the way. The other contestants, who all thought he was Kate, voted for him to win £50,000. The viewers, who knew he was Alex all along, voted for him to win an additional £25,000. This throws up some horrible lessons for viewers: you’ll never succeed by being yourself, it pays to obfuscate your true self, lying always pays – and, while it may not be shared by the rest of The Circle’s viewership, the impression I took from the finale was that we had been played just as much as Dan. It was a weird, uneasy ending to the series, and I think that’s entirely to The Circle’s credit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e61aa731ea60377e776c0ff4c4e63b5738c12b4/0_47_4537_2723/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e6e6313ea5740654ca2430c4fb7295","title":"victoria derbyshire and fiona bruce filmed for question time job bbc auditions david dimbleby","story":"BBC presenters latest to take part in secret auditions to find Sir David Dimbleby’s successorThe BBC news presenters Fiona Bruce and Victoria Derbyshire have participated in pilot episodes of Question Time, as the corporation continues its closed-door auditions to help decide who replaces Sir David Dimbleby as host .They were put through their paces in front of a cross-party panel of MPs and an audience, a member of which said Derbyshire did a better job of interacting with the audience, while Bruce appeared more focused on controlling the panellists.Questions from the audience at the event, which was filmed on Monday night at a private girls’ school in London, included “should there be a second referendum?” and “did people vote for Brexit for racist reasons?” Most audience members appeared to be anti-Brexit, according to one.The BBC has been asking backbench MPs to participate in the secret trials, filming two episodes at a time for executives to evaluate. Those appearing on the panel on Monday included the Conservatives’ Johnny Mercer and Nick Thomas-Symonds of Labour.Bruce, who presents the BBC’s evening news bulletins and the Antiques Roadshow, has not been previously tagged as a likely contender to succeed Dimbleby as chair of the Thursday-night political programme.Derbyshire, whose eponymous daytime programme on BBC One is thought to be well regarded by the corporation’s bosses, has been repeatedly tipped as a possible successor. Others in the race, Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis, Samira Ahmed, who made public her interest in a tweet, and Nick Robinson, were filmed in separate pilots at James Allen’s girls’ school in Dulwich, south London, on Sunday night.That would suggest that the Radio 4 Today programme presenter Mishal Husain is not in contention for the job, despite being tipped previously. A final decision is expected in the coming weeks.Other questions posted on Monday night included: “will men ever be held to account for their actions?”, which was linked to Brett Kavanaugh’s US supreme court confirmation battle and “are millennials ever going to own homes?” after Boris Johnson warned the Tory party conference about the impact of the housing crisis on the young.Panellists, who were paid a small fee for attending, and audience members were sworn to secrecy but information about the process and those involved has repeatedly leaked out.Dimbleby announced in June he was stepping down as chair of Question Time after 25 years his final episode will be broadcast on 13 December. He has become something of a cult figure during his time on the show, attracting parody Twitter accounts and inspiring the name “Dimblebot” and a Dimbledance competition online.The BBC has previously said it would not be commenting on the audition process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db45beab8e656d5e4f80aa70017d78050c99c00c/0_436_4763_2858/master/4763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96d445d663da460ed32a68033da0ed3f","title":"hong kong leader refuses to explain uk journalists visa denial","story":"City’s leader dismisses as ‘pure speculation’ claims move was retaliation for hosting activistHong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has refused to explain why her government declined to renew the visa of a British journalist, in an unprecedented case that has raised questions about the city’s press freedoms.The Financial Times said last week that its Asia editor, Victor Mallet, had been refused a visa to continue working in the city. The denial comes two months after Mallet hosted a speech by the pro-independence activist Andy Chan, despite calls from authorities to cancel the event.On Sunday, Mallet, who has lived in Hong Kong for more than seven years, was given seven days to leave Hong Kong.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Lam said she would not comment on inidual immigration cases. Asked whether Mallet had been denied a visa as punishment for hosting Chan, Hong Kong’s chief executive replied: “What you said is pure speculation.”While insisting that “freedom of expression, freedom of reporting, are core values in Hong Kong”, Lam said her government would “not tolerate advocacy of Hong Kong independence, which threatens national security, territorial integrity and development interests”.Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997 under an agreement it would retain a high degree of autonomy and freedoms, including a free media environment, that citizens in mainland China do not have.While Beijing has denied visas to foreign journalists before, Mallet’s case marks the first time in recent years that a foreign correspondent has been denied the right to work in Hong Kong. Media outlets have long used the city as a base to cover greater China and Asia.China’s foreign ministry has defended Hong Kong’s decision, as Chinese state media said visa renewal was a sovereign right.As of Tuesday, a petition calling on authorities to explain the decision to refuse to renew Mallet’s visa had received more than 11,000 signatures. A group of prominent Hong Kong lawyers has called the move “unprecedented”, while the American Chamber of Commerce warned restricting press freedoms would hurt Hong Kong’s competitiveness.“The incident has already shown the further erosion of freedom of expression in the city,” said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International.The UK and the US have issued statements of concern. On Monday, the European Union said: “In the absence of a credible alternative explanation from the authorities, the decision appears politically motivated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/466b63bae5bf391def355cd9cd0352e0e764d490/0_61_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62ebd3c498b8860aeb33cee63c282de2","title":"hurricane michael florida panhandle","story":"Hurricane Michael intensified over warm Gulf of Mexico waters on Tuesday, amid fears it would swiftly become a major hurricane before making landfall on Wednesday along Florida’s Panhandle. Mandatory evacuations were issued as beach dwellers rushed to board up homes ahead of what could be a devastating hit.The storm strengthened into a category two hurricane with top wind speeds of 100mph. As of 8am, it was moving north-north-westward over the southern Gulf of Mexico at about 12mph. The NHC in Miami said the hurricane was 395 miles (635km) south of Panama City and 365 miles south of Apalachicola.A hurricane hunter plane that bounced into the swirling eye off the western tip of Cuba late on Monday found wind speeds rising, supporting forecasts that the storm could reach major hurricane status on Tuesday night with winds topping 111mph (179kmh), capable of causing devastating damage.Mandatory evacuation orders went into effect Tuesday morning for about 120,000 people in Panama City Beach and across other low-lying parts of the coast as Hurricane Michael approaches.Parts of Florida’s marshy, lightly populated Big Bend area could see up to 12ft (3.7 meters) of storm surge, while Michael also could dump up to a foot (30cm) of rain over some Panhandle communities as it moves inland, forecasters said.“People need to start leaving now,” Sheriff Tommy Ford told an emergency meeting on Monday night. He said people will “not be dragged out of their homes”, but anyone who stays behind will be on their own once the storm hits.By 5am on Tuesday, Michael’s top sustained winds were up to 90mph (144kmh), centered about 390 miles (627km) south of Apalachicola and 420 miles south of Panama City. Hurricane-force winds extended outward for 35 miles from the core.Forecasters warned that Michael, now a category 1 hurricane, could ultimately dump a foot of rain in western Cuba, triggering flash floods and mudslides in mountain areas.Disaster agencies in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua reported 13 deaths as roofs collapsed and residents were carried away by swollen rivers. Six people died in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Authorities were also searching for a boy swept away by a river in Guatemala. Most of the rain was blamed on a low-pressure system off the Pacific coast, but Hurricane Michael in the Caribbean could have also contributed.Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, called Michael a “monstrous hurricane” with a devastating potential from high winds, storm surge and heavy rains. He declared a state of emergency for 35 Florida counties, from the Panhandle to Tampa Bay, activated hundreds of Florida national guard members and waived tolls to encourage evacuations.He also warned caregivers at north Florida hospitals and nursing homes to do all possible to assure the safety of the elderly and infirm. Following Hurricane Irma last year, 14 people died when a south Florida nursing home lost power and air conditioning.“If you’re responsible for a patient, you’re responsible for the patient. Take care of them,” he said.Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia county bluntly advised residents choosing to ride it out that first-responders would not be able to reach them while Michael smashes into the coast.“If you decide to stay in your home and a tree falls on your house or the storm surge catches you and you’re now calling for help, there’s no one that can respond to help you,” Morgan said.In the small Panhandle city of Apalachicola, Mayor Van Johnson Sr said the 2,300 residents were frantically preparing for what could be a strike unlike any seen there in decades. Many filled sandbags and boarded up homes and lined up to buy gas and groceries before leaving town.No shelters will be open in Wakulla County, the sheriff’s office warned on Facebook, because they are rated safe only for hurricanes with top sustained winds below 111mph. With Michael’s winds projected to be even stronger, residents were urged to evacuate inland.“This storm has the potential to be a historic storm, please take heed,” the sheriff’s office said in the post.The entire neighboring state of Alabama is under an emergency declaration. Governor Kay Ivey said she feared widespread power outages and other problems would follow. Forecasters warned spinoff tornadoes would also be a threat.With the storm next entering the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, which has warm water and favorable atmospheric conditions, “there is a real possibility that Michael will strengthen to a major hurricane before landfall,” Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist at the Miami-based storm forecasting hub, wrote in an advisory.A large mound of sand in Tallahassee was whittled down to a small pile within hours on Monday as residents filled sandbags against potential flooding.Mayor Andrew Gillum, Florida’s Democratic nominee for governor, filled sandbags with residents and urged residents of the state capital city to finish emergency preparations quickly. Local authorities fear power outages and major tree damage from Michael.“Today it is about life and safety,” Gillum said. “There’s nothing between us and this storm but warm water’ and I think that’s what terrifies us about the potential impacts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d81eb1bf812032254221e6b4083bd1ad3493686/357_77_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f409577e4f3bab29938d6bbf459be3b","title":"i had a moral duty whistleblowers on why they spoke up","story":"They took on warmongers, sexual abuse and tax dodgers. Would they do it again?by Teri Pengilley,  Christopher Thomond ,  Murdo MacLeod,  Sarah Lee and words by Caitlin DiskenIn an age where information is tightly controlled by image-makers, spin doctors and gatekeepers, real scandal can often only be revealed with the help of whistleblowers.To mark the 25th anniversary of the whistleblowing charity Protect (formerly known as Public Concern at Work) – we focus on 12 people who have taken great personal risk to expose everything from warmongers to tax dodgers and sexual and physical abuse.“I could have been fined a million euros,” the Luxleaks whistleblower Antoine Deltour says when reflecting on his ordeal. Since passing information about controversial tax agreements to the French journalist Edouard Perrin, the former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee has faced global media attention and two trials. By 2016, more than 215,000 people had signed a petition pledging support for Deltour.It was in 2011 that Deltour first passed documents to Perrin, detailing how companies such as Amazon and Dyson struck (perfectly legal) deals with Luxembourg to avoid cross-border tax. The International Consortium of Journalists used this leaked data to unveil the extent of the tax avoidance in 2014. Many of the multinational companies involved had managed to reduce their tax to near zero by developing complex strategies with the Grand Duchy.The data leak was denounced by Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg’s finance minister, as “the worst attack” ever experienced by his country. Indeed, Deltour grimly acknowledges the immense courage needed on his part. In 2016, he was convicted of theft, receiving a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €1,500. Even so, he still insists he would whistleblow again.“Democracy demands information,” Deltour says. “I still believe I acted in the public interest.”In early 2018, Deltour was finally acknowledged as a whistleblower, and his conviction was quashed. But in what Deltour describes as a “smart move”, a €1,000 fine against Raphael Halet, who also passed Luxleaks information on, was upheld. “There’s a message there,” Deltour notes. “By recognising me, they’re making out that they’re open. But by condemning Raphael, they’re making sure people think twice before speaking to a journalist.”Katharine Gun was 28 when she tried to prevent one of the deadliest wars of the 21st century.Whilst working as a mandarin translator at GCHQ, Gun and her colleagues received a request from America’s National Security Agency. The email requested an intelligence “surge’ of diplomats attached to the UN security council, to secure crucial information on the voting intentions of member states in the run-up to the Iraq war.Gun, horrified at these “dirty-tricks”, leaked the email to the Observer, and was subsequently sacked and arrested, an ordeal which she describes as “isolating”. “I felt very much alone,” she says. “I didn’t know whether I would be charged.”Although her leak did not deter the war, it did cause worldwide outrage, and a second UN resolution to authorise the war never occurred. Gun’s trial collapsed due to insufficient evidence, and her whistleblowing is now being immortalised in upcoming film Official Secrets. Would she blow the whistle again? “Yeah, I would,” she says. “There is always a need for whistleblowers – we don’t live in a society which is transparent, fair and just. Whistleblowers hold people to account.”As a nurse with decades of experience, Terry Bryan was appalled by the abuse he witnessed at Winterbourne View, a hospital for people with learning difficulties. After his concerns were ignored by management, he raised his claims with the Care Quality Commission. In what the CQC described as an “unforgivable error of judgement”, no action was taken.Bryan then turned to BBC Panorama, whose show Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed cast Winterbourne’s conditions into the limelight. Bryan’s whistleblowing led to six care workers being given prison sentences, and NHS England developing its 2011 “transforming care” agenda. The agenda aimed to reduce patient admissions to hospitals like Winterbourne.Bryan now works for Care Inspectorate Wales, using his experience to inspect care homes and nursing homes around South Wales. When asked if he would be prepared to blow the whistle again, it was an unequivocal yes. “It’s about following your conscience,” he says. “How would you live with yourself if you didn’t do it?”Awarded whistleblower of the year by Middlesex University in 2014, Osita Mba’s actions have been highly commended. In March 2011, the former HMRC solicitor contacted the National Audit Office, revealing a “sweetheart deal” between HMRC and the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. Mba alleged that HMRC’s most senior tax official had let Goldman Sachs off paying at least £20m in interest. “I considered it my duty as a public servant to report it,” Mba reflects. After feeling unsatisfied with the NAO’s report in the matter, Mba then took the claims to the public accounts committee of the House of Commons. “Fortunately, my claims were taken seriously and investigated,” he says.In an action widely condemned by MPs, HMRC then used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to search through the phone records and emails of both Mba and his wife. “I expected them to do it, so I wasn’t surprised when I found out that they had,” says Mba, who was also suspended from his job. Despite his ordeal, he is able to see the positives: “I have paid dearly in terms of my career so far, but the peace of mind I have enjoyed is priceless.”In 2013, Mba received the equivalent of three years’ salary and pension contribution in a compromise agreement. Looking back, he describes whistleblowing as a “battle of conscience”. “Only the truth will set you free,” he says. “If I find myself in a situation where my conscience tells me that speaking out is the right thing to do, I will do it.”Claire Gilham was a district judge at Warrington county court when she first raised her complaints. Working in family courts, she witnessed hostage-taking and violence, and was even alerted by the police that someone was threatening to kill her. Initially, she was encouraged to speak out, but gradually support for her waned. Isolated and excluded, she recalls telling her human resources team: “I can’t stand this, I’m going to break down.”Gilham’s case remains unique among the other whistleblowers. Judges are not classed as workers, and so aren’t entitled to the legal protections usually given to whistleblowers. “I think it’s dangerous to exclude people from statutory protection,” Gilham says, when asked about her determination to take her case to the supreme court. It was previously dismissed by an employment tribunal and the appeals court, which upheld the ruling that judges are not workers.Working with Protect (formerly Public Concern at Work) throughout her case, Gilham remembers their ability to reflect critically on her case. “It was reassuring to find that whistleblowers aren’t crazy, resentful people,” Gilham adds. Rather, they are simply people unwilling to assist in the concealment of mistakes.“If judges, the most privileged people in the country, can’t speak out, then who can?” says Gilham, who feels a sense of responsibility for those less able to speak out. She is adamant that she would be prepared to blow the whistle again. “You have to reflect on what you’re doing and walk forward. You have to be ethical.”In a 2016 speech discussing his whistleblowing experience, the Conservative peer Kevin Shinkwin described it as the saddest moment of his career. Does he still view it this way? “Yes, it still is the saddest moment,” he says. “It completely shattered my trust.”The incident in question happened in 2010, when Lord Shinkwin was working as the head of public affairs and communication at the Royal British Legion. He was asked to sign an invoice of £10,000 for an MP’s researcher, a huge sum of money that Shinkwin recommended should not be paid. “The issue of trust was paramount,” he says. “People give money to charities in the good faith that it will be spent properly.”Although Shinkwin notes that there is no evidence the money was ever paid, he emphasises that the way he was treated for raising concerns is what matters. He was bullied by a senior director, who demanded that the money be paid. The then director general even led Shinkwin to believe a payment had been made. He says he was eventually eased out of his role at the Legion. “I knew that by speaking up, I was sacrificing my career,” he says.Shinkwin is keen to emphasise that the Royal British Legion is a different place today. “I don’t believe what happened to me would happen at the Legion now,” he says, noting the competence of the Legion’s new senior team.The past few months have been rough for Shahmir Sanni. Since March, he’s been alienated by those he trusted, fired from his job at the TaxPayers’ Alliance and outed as gay by Downing Street. All this stems from an interview published in the Observer – an interview in which Sanni alleged that the leave campaign broken campaign rules to win the Brexit vote..“I was traumatised,” says Sanni of the moment that a rival revealed his sexuality. “I thought, you know what, screw these guys. I realised I had a moral duty to bring light on each and every inidual. It was about justice for the British electorate, but also justice for LGBTQ+ people and people of colour, bigger than Brexit.”Sanni’s interview revealed that Vote Leave were close to exceeding their £7m spending budget. They received a donation of £1m a couple of weeks before the referendum that would have tipped them over. They decided to “donate” £625,000 to BeLeave, a youth group founded by Darren Grimes. Initially ecstatic, Sanni quickly realised they would never see any of the money. Instead, it was ploughed back into Vote Leave’s campaign.“What’s the point of democracy if you’re going to cheat?” asks Sanni, who still remains a committed Eurosceptic. “Justice comes when people are being investigated and fined.”When asked if he would blow the whistle again, Sanni is unsure. “Short answer: yes. But I do often say probably not.” Sanni advises those who have had any minor or major mental illness, particularly people of colour, to think twice before whistleblowing.“When you whistleblow as a minority, there are massive implications,” says Sanni, who recalls both Brexiters and remainers doubting his integrity. Despite this, he remains upbeat. When asked for a final statement, he jokes: “Follow me on Instagram.”Quickly becoming serious again, he is keen to emphasise the gravity of the situation. “It was a huge electoral scandal. It’s about more than Brexit now. It’s about ensuring that our democracy is retained.”When the media mogul Robert Maxwell died in 1991, he was mourned as the Daily Mirror’s “saviour”. Yet, in the wake of his death, a vast pension fraud was revealed. In all, some £400m was found to have been taken from the Mirror’s pension fund, leaving employees facing a bleak future. For Harry Templeton, who initially blew the whistle on this in 1988, the revelations came “too late”.Templeton, a printer for the Mirror Group newspapers, sat on the board of trustees for the Mirror’s pension scheme. A union-approved trustee, he challenged Maxwell about the way he planned to use the pension funds. In a vote about the scheme, Templeton found himself outnumbered 13-1. The seven management-approved trustees on the board wouldn’t dare vote against Maxwell, Templeton recalls. The six other union-approved trustees were simply “very naive”.“I had to bring my problems home to my family,” says Templeton, remembering his experience as demoralising. “It was like banging your head against a brick wall.”Shortly after, he was fired from the company under the pretext of threatening another worker. “You have to remember, companies don’t sack someone for blowing the whistle,” Templeton says. “They find other reasons to, and they offer people incentives to keep their mouths shut.”Templeton recognises the challenges that whistleblowers and their supporters face. “You have to try to do something about it, but the other side doesn’t stick to the rules, they find every method they can.”Howard Shaw, a former detective sergeant at the politan Police, describes his experience as a whistleblower as a “lonely two years”. Now chief compliance officer at Joules Africa, Shaw blew the whistle after alleging that a former colleague cheated in a job interview that led to his promotion.Shaw raised concerns with his superiors that the colleague had seen interview questions in advance. His claims were ignored and the inidual was then appointed as his line manager. Shaw was subsequently removed from his unit.“I was under the care of my doctor and on medication, I had counselling,” Shaw remembers. Unprepared to leave the unit quietly, Shaw brought the case to an employment tribunal, which awarded him £37,000 damages and £1,000 costs after finding that he did have legal protection as a whistleblower.Despite his success, Shaw says regrettably that he would not blow the whistle again, but instead calls for reform of whistleblowing laws. “The law needs to be more user-friendly, more accessible and less judicial.”Chris Day was a junior doctor on the way to becoming a consultant when his career progress was cut short. While working on a south London hospital’s intensive care unit, Day became increasingly concerned regarding staffing levels. “One of my principal disclosures was made in real time at the beginning of the night shift,” he remembers. “I had no choice – the consequences of not making the disclosure might have been even more scary.”Yet Day’s allegations had lifechanging consequences for him. His whistleblowing cost him his consultancy career and he has been working as a locum doctor in A\u0026ampE departments, while he fights his case.  Instead of acting on his safety concerns, Health Education England attempted to argue they were not his employer.“I don’t know why there is such resistance to culture change and meaningful legal protection for whistleblowers,” says Day, whose case has since succeeded, granting 54,000 junior doctors whistleblowing protection. “Maybe they think the public cannot cope with the truth about what is happening in the NHS.”Day remains a vocal supporter of the NHS, and he has since mounted campaigns to keep it public. Reflecting on his experience, he says: “I would only whistleblow again if a person’s life was in immediate danger. Politicians want healthcare staff to keep quiet and get on with the job.”From humble beginnings in Liverpool, Michael Woodford quickly rose through the ranks at digital camera company Olympus, before becoming the company’s first non-Japanese president in 2011. Just weeks later he became suspicious of several acquisitions the company had made in what turned out to be a £1bn fraud scandal. “I could look away, but if I did that I would become part of it. Once you’ve crossed that bridge, there’s no going back.”However, the meeting Woodford called to address the claims quickly backfired. The board turned on him and he was fired. But when the fraud was linked to the Japanese mafia, Woodford realised his problems were only just beginning.“I thought I was going to be assassinated,” recalls Woodford, who was forced by the company to give up his apartment and return to the UK. “At times I felt I was in Alice in Wonderland and I questioned my sanity. I was completely isolated.”Fearing for the lives of both himself and his family, Woodford decided to seek safety through publicity. His actions led to two senior Olympus board members being sentenced to three years in prison. In 2012, Woodford won a £10m out-of-court settlement after suing Olympus.Now a patron of the whistleblowing charity Protect, Woodford recommends that whistleblowers act with caution. “If you are going to take on a large company, make sure you seek advice, talk to people you trust and seek legal advice,” he says. He admits that whistleblowing isn’t easy, but is adamant he would be prepared to do it again.Maggie Oliver remembers her experience as a whistleblower as one defined by stress, sleepless nights and fear. “They were the worst two years of my life,” says the former detective constable. “I truly believed I may be prosecuted for simply telling the truth and trying to expose the neglect of the authorities.”While working with Greater Manchester police (GMP), Oliver had been central to uncovering a Rochdale paedophile ring. By interacting with the group’s victims nearly every day for six months, Oliver gradually gained the trust of the vulnerable girls. The girls eventually agreed to come forward, which led to nine members of the gang being sentenced in 2012.For Oliver, though, the actions of the police were not sufficient to safeguard the victims. One of the girls, who had been abused since the age of 14, was named in court as someone who had helped the groomers. Disgusted, Oliver took her complaints to various departments of GMP, and even the Home Office, before resigning in 2012.“I have no regrets about the action I took,” she claims. “I feel proud to know I was strong enough to stand up for what I believed in, and fight to give these kids a voice.”Louise O’Neill at Protect helped secure these interviews.Produced by Joanna Ruck and Matt Fidler"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c2d21eb2eb6ac72d2311ea81c21acb43923e2d7/0_31_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6434430768c5ca3919cd6a37231ad0a7","title":"indonesia orders foreign aid workers helping with tsunami effort to leave","story":"Disaster agency says foreign NGOs should ‘retrieve their personnel immediately’Foreign aid workers who rallied to the island of Sulawesi after the devastating earthquake and tsunami more than a week ago have been asked to leave the country by the Indonesian government.Foreign agencies flew in after a devastating earthquake on 28 September, which triggered a tsunami. The official death toll from the disaster is 1,944, about 5,000 people remain missing, presumed dead.Indonesia’s national disaster management authority (BNBP) issued regulations for international NGOs, including that: “Foreign NGOs who have deployed foreign personnel are advised to retrieve their personnel immediately.”The announcement has prompted concerns that the ability of NGOs to deliver aid will be hampered.Tim Costello, the chief advocate for charity World Vision, called the announcement by the government “very odd” and said it meant that overworked and traumatised Indonesia staff and volunteers were not able to be supported and relieved by fresh foreign staff.Indonesian authorities were criticised for how long it took them to get search and rescue equipment and aid to Palu and other areas affected by the natural disaster. In the aftermath of the disaster, the city of Palu went days without power and clean water, leading to reports of looting, long queues for fuel and desperate scenes at the city’s airport. Countries including Australia, New Zealand and the UK pledged aid.The regulations issued by the Indonesian government are directed toward international NGOs. Large organisations such as World Vision, which are registered as local NGOs in Indonesia, are allowed to remain.Jen Clancy at the Australian Council for International Development (Acfid), Australia’s peak body for aid NGOs, said only a small number of international staff were being allowed on the ground to provide technical assistance.Acfid members on the ground in Indonesia told Clancy the restrictions on the number of foreign aid workers was not hampering the response, however they did note concerns about fatigue and exhaustion of local staff.A senior international NGO worker currently in Indonesia advising on the disaster told the  that Indonesia’s preference for local NGOs over foreign ones was “normal”.The worker said that while there were some roles requiring specialist technical skills, these can generally be performed from headquarters and last only for a few weeks, whereas for the bulk of roles, it made sense to hire locally.Clancy said international NGOs had to walk a careful line of not acting paternalistically and taking over aid operations. “There’s pushback against the international community who come flooding in days or weeks later, taking over the response. It’s about taking back that power and saying local organisations have significant capacity.”The Indonesian government, the Indonesian Red Cross and other Indonesian NGOs all have “significant capacity” for providing humanitarian assistance, said Clancy. “Natural disasters aren’t a new phenomenon for Indonesia, unfortunately … They are well experienced in responding to natural disasters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dff48d8648cf0b93aaed61fd6f19eaa9273442f/949_922_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3598ba093e570ff6e2002bf120f4446","title":"castellers human towers of catalonia","story":"The 27th Human Tower Competition in Tarragona, Spain.

Ahead of the meeting Ms Foster said the Brexit poll result “must be respected”.The Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann is to hold a separate meeting with Mr Barnier on Tuesday.The surveys found that 87 per cent of Leave voters in Northern Ireland, who are overwhelmingly unionist, see the collapse of the peace process as an acceptable price for Brexit. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU by a majority of 56 per cent to 44 per cent.The surveys were conducted for the two universities by YouGov in England, Wales and Scotland and Lucid Talk in Northern Ireland between May 30th and June 4th this year. A total of 1,089 adults were surveyed in Northern Ireland, 2,741 in England, 2,016 in Wales and 1,502 in Scotland.Northern Ireland recorded the highest percentage of Leavers as favouring Brexit above the peace. The question posed was, “Price worth paying for Brexit: peace in NI”.The surveys found that 84 per cent of Leavers in Wales, 83 per cent in England and 73 per cent in Scotland put Brexit ahead of the peace process.The same question was posed to those who voted to stay in the EU.Just one in 100 of Northern Ireland Remainers viewed Brexit as more important than peace, while 10 per cent of Remainers in England and Wales and 12 per cent in Scotland put implementing Brexit about the peace process.The surveys also found that clear majorities of English Conservatives would support Scottish independence (79 per cent) or the collapse of the peace process (75 per cent) as the price of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

The majority of these are in low-income countries where health care workers have poor access to testing and treatment facilities.The research team has come up with a system which enables doctors or other health workers to detect TB-specific antibodies in a patient’s sputum. The patient produces a sample of sputum - this is put onto a tiny biosensor device which produces a colour, depending on whether it is positive or negative for TB.Via a smartphone\u0027s camera the app then analyses the colour and delivers a diagnosis within seconds.TB incidence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South East AsiaAlamgir Hossain, director of the Anglia Ruskin IT Research Institute, said analysis of colour samples using the naked eye alone was notoriously difficult. “By using the phone’s camera to capture the sample, rather than manually using colour charts, it eliminates human error and avoids any subjectivity around interpretation.  It also means that positive and negative samples do not need to be distinguishable to the human eye or depend on perfect colour vision,” said Prof Hossain.“This system wouldn’t be used instead of seeing a physician but would be a first port of call.  If the app detects tuberculosis it would instruct the user to contact a medical professional,” he added.The scientists hope to eventually add in DNA sequencing to enable the diagnosis to be more robust, said Prof Hossain.“If you add in the DNA sequencing on top of the biosensor the overall framework for the diagnosis will be much better and doctors will be able to consider this as a primary diagnosis. Many remote areas have limited testing facilities so if you can develop a mobile system it will really help,” he said.As well as a smartphone the health worker needs to purchase a small biosensor which has been developed by Universiti Putra. No additional hardware is needed and the system works offline so can be used in areas without internet connection.\u0026#039A quintessential disease of poverty\u0026#039 | The push to free Papua New Guinea from TBProf Hossain believes that the final cost for the system - downloading the app and purchasing the biosensor - could be as little as £2 to £3, depending on funding and uptake.The scientists hope that the diagnostic test, developed with a £129,000 grant from the Newton Fund, will be ready to launch in two years.Prof Hossain is currently supervising three PhD students looking at

gone\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureA Banksy artwork self-destructed moments after it was sold for £1m to an anonymous phone bidder at Sotheby’s auction house.Girl with\u0026nbspBalloon was shredded by a mechanism hidden within its own frame in front of a stunned audience in London on Friday night.Banksy, whose true identity remains unknown, celebrated the prank with a post on Instagram with the caption: “Going going gone”.“It appears we just got Banksy-ed,” said Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s senior director and head of contemporary art.The 2006 artwork, which depicts a girl reaching out to a red heart-shaped balloon and is one of Banksy’s most iconic images, was valued at around £300,000 but eventually sold for £1,042,000.As the gavel went down to signal the end of the auction at 9pm, an alarm went off and the canvas began sliding downwards through the frame.It emerged at the bottom sliced into ribbons, prompting officials to rush in to take the artwork from the wall in a doomed bid to save it.Sotheby’s described the surprise as “instant art world folklore” and said it marked “the first time in auction history that a work of art automatically shredded itself after coming under the hammer.”The auction house said that the successful bidder was “surprised by the story” and added: “We are in discussion about next steps”.Last year, the musician and DJ Goldie appeared to let slip that he was called Robert, an apparent reference to Massive Attack member Robert del Naja.The artist first achieved notoriety\u0026nbspwith a series of graffiti pieces that appeared on buildings across the country and later became involved in a public battle with rival King Robbo, who died in 2014.Created with Sketch.Has Banksy\u0027s real identity been discovered at

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there\u0027s expected to be a version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, a new Chromecast, as well as potentially new tablets and watches.It remains to be seen what surprises Google might have up its sleeve: plenty has leaked about the phone, to the extent that it is already for sale on the black market. And just as much has leaked about everything else, including new Chromecasts that have appeared on shelves in the US.Everything kicks off at 4pm UK time, or 11am\u0026nbspeastern.

Reaching almost 15 metres tall, the blades of sharp ice could be a fatal barrier to any attempt to meet that extra-terrestrial life.Any potential landing mission would have to navigate those penitentes before it could drop onto the surface.Nasa spacecraft reveals strange details of Saturn\u0027s ringsThe spikes are formed through a process known as sublimation. That turns ice into water vapour without melting into a liquid between the two, and leaves behind those blade-like formations that point right up into the sun.Penitentes\u0026nbspdo grow down on Earth. But here they are restricted to extreme areas such as the Andes and grow between one and five metres tall.Europa however is much more suited to growing the huge blades\u0026nbspbecause its surface is dominated by ice, it has the right thermal conditions for that sublimation to occur, and the sun always shines at the same angle towards the surface.“The unique conditions of Europa present both exciting exploratory possibilities and potentially treacherous danger,\u0026nbspsaid lead author of the research Dr Daniel\u0026nbspHobley, from Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences.“The presence of sharp, blade-like structures towering to almost 15 metres high would make any potential landing mission to Europa extremely precarious. We hope that studies like ours will help the engineers to develop innovative ways of delivering landers safely on Europa’s surface so that we can find out even more about this fascinating place, and potentially look for signs of extra-terrestrial life.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That is certainly the case where me and Rupert Murdoch are concerned.I was a young, new journalist on The Sunday Times. I’d been charged with “gutting” an official report into a business deal – the buyer was thought to have covered up the source\u0026nbspof his money. It was a big story at the time. I was called to the editor’s office\u0026nbspand told, to my shock, that I was not only going to cover the findings, but I was writing that week’s leader.Just at that point, as the news sank in, the editor suddenly rose. Behind me, a familiar figure had walked, unannounced, into the room. It was Murdoch, the proprietor. He gestured to sit down, and asked what we were discussing.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyThe editor told him, and explained that it was going to be the subject of an editorial\u0026nbspand that I was putting it together. Whereupon Murdoch turned to me, fixed me with a stare, and asked: “Why does it matter?”I stammered some sort of reply about the importance of knowing where people’s funding originated – this was well before money laundering became a hot topic. Murdoch wrinkled his face. I was on shaky ground, clearly he did not think it of any importance at all. Then, another man who was standing in the doorway, who was accompanying him, spoke. He reminded Murdoch that they’d done a deal with the subject of the official inquiry, which had gone sour. Murdoch listened, and nodded. “That’s right, I remember.” He looked at me. “Son, write it as hard as you like.”Down the years, the memory of that short encounter has stuck. Murdoch was not physically large, but he conveyed immense power. His energy was obvious. He was naturally combative, constantly seeking to challenge.Back then, the basement under The Sunday Times building in\u0026nbspWapping was a store room. It was full of satellite dishes. Sky TV was in its infancy, and it relied on the newfangled device of a dish rather than the traditional aerial. If I’m honest, I doubt if many of us gave the fledgling venture much of a chance. Terrestrial broadcasting, led by the BBC, was so entrenched in the UK, that the prospect of it being seriously taken on seemed fanciful. Not only that, Sky would have to rely on a pay-per-view model, while the BBC was funded by the government, and by what was effectively a tax in the form of the annual licence fee.The amount the Murdoch family is said to have made from selling their 39 per cent stake in Sky to ComcastSome 30 years later, Murdoch has sold his remaining 39 per cent stake in Sky to the US company Comcast, in a deal that valued the UK firm at £30bn, and which netted the founder and his family £12bn.The company statement which accompanied the deal showed I was not alone in my scepticism. “When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,” it said. “We bet – and almost lost –\u0026nbspthe farm on launching a business that many didn’t think was such a good idea. Today, Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company and a world-class example of a customer-driven enterprise.”While that hints at the risk Murdoch took –\u0026nbspand gives some indication of his resulting emotional attachment to the company, and pride in his achievement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit does not say what Sky also did: transforming English football rivalling the mighty BBC for news coverage with Sky News and taking on broadband providers by offering internet services. And as it says, the company spread across Europe, in Italy and Germany. In the process, Sky also grew to become a central component in the Murdoch global empire.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyComcast beats Rupert Murdoch’s Fox in Sky takeover battleMPs vow to defy ‘threatening’ newspaper headlines on Brexit voteTony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Now, it’s gone. Not only that, Murdoch has previously sold much of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV production assets to Disney in a $70bn (£54bn) deal, leaving him and his family with the Fox sports and news channels, and the News Corp newspaper and publishing businesses in the UK, US and Australia.That’s still a massive undertaking, and one that would keep most people fully engaged. But Murdoch is not most people. Even at 87 years of age he exhibits the ambition and drive of someone much younger.There have been signs in recent years of Murdoch slowing down. But it would be wrong to suppose these latest developments\u0026nbspwill see him signal the end. When he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on phone hacking by his newspapers in 2012\u0026nbspthe slowness of his answers, containing numerous pauses, shocked many.Not those who know Murdoch. He’s always spoken like this, particularly in a situation where he is being confronted and put on the spot. His tactic is to buy time, to speak after a considered silence, to be drawn out, and careful.He is extremely happily ensconced\u0026nbspwith his new wife, Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior. At a recent party, attended by media and arts folk, their arrival drew the usual sarcastic whispers, along the lines of what does the tall, former supermodel see in the much older billionaire. My wife, who was observing, said it was obvious – they were very much in love, you only had to look at their body language, and their attentiveness towards each other, to realise that.She had a point: they did indeed appear infatuated, moving away from the crowd to sit,\u0026nbspchat and laugh together.These days, Murdoch is more likely to be found in suburban Richmond, in southwest London, where Jerry has long maintained a glorious home, than in one of the world’s business centres. Early mornings often find him taking a constitutional walk in nearby Richmond Park. But that does not mean the friendly old cove – several journalists have declared their astonishment at seeing the feared media titan strolling along, smiling and relaxed – is not pondering as he goes.It’s too easy to suppose the phrase “clogs to clogs in three generations” applies to Rupert and his offspring. On the face of it that might appear so – he spends three decades building up Sky, longer where his newspapers are concerned\u0026nbsphis progeny are not up to the task of grabbing the steering wheel and pushing the businesses on to even greater heights.It’s true that they might lack their father’s hunger and clarity of vision. It’s impossible for instance to imagine James, Lachlan or Elisabeth (Prudence, their elder half-sister, is not so business-oriented) having the courage to buy a fading paper like The Sun, and to turn it into the self-styled “People’s Paper”, challenging the orthodoxy every inch of the way. Or being prepared to tilt at BBC News. Or\u0026nbspdisrupting the established order by forcing up the price of live sports rights.Neither, though, are any of the three exactly business schmucks. Each has proved themselves to be successful, capable of guiding and leading. They are however very different characters, with specific interests and qualities. Broadly, James is into distribution and technology, Lachlan loves news, Elisabeth is adept at developing new TV content. Ideally, possibly, Murdoch might have hoped for one of them to emerge as a Rupert Mk2, but that has not materialised.According to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, he was desperate for his children to take over –\u0026nbsp“taking pride of place even over profits.”It was not to be.The fact is that with the sales, Murdoch has seen the threat posed by the digital juggernauts, realised he was embedded predominantly in legacy media, as it’s somewhat disparagingly referred to by the onliners, decided it was going to be tough\u0026nbsp(and get even tougher)\u0026nbspto compete – so stayed in the game, but readied to sell up if the price was right.Murdoch’s passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is in newsThat moment has been reached, but while it must rankle that his interests have shrunk, he can take satisfaction from the realisation that the price paid is far higher than anyone foresaw. He may be emotionally attached, but price will always win out. Indeed, he can allow himself a wry smile that Comcast may turn out to have overpaid.Meanwhile, the pressure of combatting the tech behemoths is off, and all he has to do is count his winnings. Murdoch’s situation is akin to that of a poker player getting out while on top. Yes, he may have gone on to chalk up yet more brilliant hands, but equally he may not have been dealt any more. Better, surely, to duck out now, and leave the agony of battle, and watch how the cards fall to the other players in future.There were opponents –\u0026nbspJames, in particular, is believed to have been resistant (as he should have been, since it was James’s part of the Murdoch business mass that was being offloaded).In the end, says Wolff:\u0026nbsp“It is Hall who is said to have given voice to the obvious: just sell and be done.”But it’s not as if the Murdochs are quitting completely. Not only do they retain Fox News and their other sports channels and Fox assets\u0026nbsp(now repackaged in New Fox, to be run by Lachlan), but they have some of the world’s leading print titles with their attendant websites, to be going on with. And bags of cash.They’re now able to pick and choose what they want to buy, where they want to go. One assumption is that they will bolster New Fox’s presence in sports by purchasing more live TV rights. Another is that they will seek to get back into content creation by making their own programmes for the Fox TV networks. Already, names like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lionsgate are being mentioned as possible acquisition targets. Or, New Fox might decide to start from scratch and develop its own version of Netflix.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Lachlan takes the tiller at New Fox, answerable to his father. James is going off to pursue other interests – he is a director of Tesla, and a close friend of Matthew Vaughn, the film producer and director, and the possibility of James and Matthew hooking up in business together has been rumoured.Of course, it won’t be the same, but consider: New Fox alone should generate more than $2bn a year in cash, and that’s without dipping into the proceeds from the sales of Fox’s entertainment and production arms, and Sky. Murdoch and the younger Murdochs, in short, are not leaving the global media stage. Not yet.It may just be that the sell-offs allow Murdoch to return to his first love: newspapers. He was never that much interested in producing entertainment shows and films. His passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is\u0026nbspin news. And that means Fox, but it also means newspapers, where he began, in Australia, all those years ago.In Australia, his newspapers played a pivotal role in the\u0026nbsprecent putsch against the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, criticising his energy policy. In the UK, his company has moved into news and current affairs radio, adding Talk Radio. Meanwhile, his News UK newspapers continue to enjoy prominence and influence, setting the agenda for TV and radio newscasts.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopIn the US, Murdoch finds himself in a curious position. He’s not thought to have much regard for Donald Trump, although he is close to Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump, though, is a Republican, and a maverick, someone who likes to shake up the established way. In that sense, he is just like the head of the Fox channel –\u0026nbspTrump’s favourite and, in turn, a strident supporter of the president –\u0026nbspand the newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.Murdoch may have little time for Trump. For all his directness, and for all the cheekiness of some of his titles, notably The Sun, Murdoch remains a serious man at heart, reserving his favour for conviction politicians. But even if Trump does not qualify for praise\u0026nbspin Murdoch’s eyes,\u0026nbspthe media chief still remains a hugely vital figure, right at the centre of the daily cut and thrust surrounding the president.There is much, then, for Murdoch to relish. A chapter or two has been brought to a close, but the story of Murdoch and the Murdochs is far from over.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

disarray’\u0026nbspas British project leaders have their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He made several puns referring to Swift\u0027s songs and albums in his message, including Bad Blood and\u0026nbspSpeak Now.\u0026nbspVoicing your political or religious beliefs is always going to separate people and potentially create bad blood, he said. I have always defended Taylor because I know her heart, I know how her family\u0026nbspraised her and how they\u0027ve treated me and welcomed me into their home, life and family with open arms.He added: We have talked for so many hours about these subjects and she has taken the time to actively listen to me, her queer friend who also happens to be a person of colour.I feel heard and valued as a person who lives what some consider an \u0027alternative lifestyle\u0027 but what YOU see as a beautiful life, he said. I can\u0027t help but to feel like I played even the smallest of parts in helping you get to this point, and I\u0027m just so dang happy that the world gave you time to learn (in your own way and at your own pace) how important it is for you to speak out and speak now.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in a candle-light vigil in memory of Bulgarian TV journalist Viktoria Marinova in RuseSupporters of Jair Bolsonaro, presidential candidate with the Social Liberal Party, celebrate in front of his house during the general elections in Rio.

Surprising everyone with a measured, thoughtful and carefully worded post on Instagram, the 28-year-old pop star has endorsed not one, but two Democrat candidates for the upcoming mid-term elections – to the horror of Republicans everywhere.Country artists, even ones who are global pop stars, aren’t supposed to be progressive (as the\u0026nbspDixie Chicks found in 2003 when they opposed\u0026nbspthe Iraq War). So much so that when Swift refused to endorse a presidential candidate during the 2016 election, everyone assumed she’d voted for Donald Trump. Critics used “evidence” like her blonde hair to align her with\u0026nbspthe far right, while one publication went so far to run an editorial accusing her of being “an envoy for Trump’s values”, because her songs apparently echoed Trump’s obsession with “petty score-settling” – forgetting it’s a bit different when said score-settler is running the most powerful nation on earth. Anyway, Swift is clearly fed up of everyone’s rubbish guesswork.Events in the past two years have changed her view on voicing political opinions, Swift explained. She didn’t specify, but you can fairly assume those events include winning a sexual assault case against a radio DJ accused of groping her being caught up in a feud with Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian and having to watch a misogynist, neo-Nazi apologist become president of the United States.Swift has previously been criticised for her apparent lack of self-awareness over the privileges she enjoys as a wealthy, young white woman – one of the most notable being when she responded to Nicki Minaj’s frustration at not being nominated for video of the year at the VMAs in 2015. Another was when she was accused of playing the victim after being name-dropped in West’s track “Famous”, where he called her a bitch and claimed credit for her fame. Kim Kardashian branded Swift a “snake”,\u0026nbspand Swift was besieged by an army of West and Kardashian fans posting snake emojis on her Instagram.How might Kavanaugh shape abortion, gun control, and impeachment lawTaylor Swift gets political: Reactions to her Democrat endorsementBut over the last two years, Swift appears to have gone to enormous lengths to educate herself about representation and inclusivity. Her Reputation world tour stars\u0026nbspa wealth of dancers and backing musicians from a range of ethnicities, backgrounds and body types, and she used her massive platform to speak clearly and passionately about LGBTQ+ rights. Her friend, the singer, producer, actor and dancer Todrick Hall, praised her for taking the time to “actively listen to me, her queer friend who also happens to be a person of colour”. Meanwhile, Kanye is parading around in a MAGA hat and endorsing Trump in off-script speeches on Saturday Night Live.Kanye West \u0027Being mentally ill is not an excuse to act like a jack*ss\u0027While it’s still not clear how much of an impact Swift will have on the Tennessee mid-term results, Swift has made it clear she will never be pressured into doing or saying something that others want her to. This statement was on her own terms, from her own platform, made when she was ready. And that, in itself, is an inherently political act:\u0026nbspSwift grew up amid the rise of a social media age where your past views often come back to haunt you – where an old tweet can get you fired, or a misjudged remark from a decade before can still ignite a baying mob. It\u0027s no surprise that she was previously reluctant to say anything.\u0026nbspBut by referencing how her views have changed, and also acknowledging how she may not agree with everything her chosen candidates do, she allows room for nuance. Which, in this day and age, is too often absent from political discourse.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They kicked the door down.\u0026nbsp“They led me out in handcuffs and put me in a detention centre for two days. Obviously I was frantic.\u0026nbspI had panic attacks in the car.“For the next eight months I wasn’t allowed to work.\u0026nbspI had to go and sign on every two weeks. I got into\u0026nbsprent arrears. My mum had to take on another job to help me.\u0026nbspWe were frantic. We were paying solicitor fees, lawyer fees, trying to get it sorted.”After eight tumultuous months,\u0026nbspMr Azolukwam was told the letter had been a mistake. His first priority was to start working again – but his optimism was short lived.“I hadn’t been working for so long. I wasn’t trying to get out there immediately, get a job, try sort my life out,” he said.\u0026nbsp“And then all of a sudden, two or three weeks ago, they sent me a letter again. It said you’re not allowed to work, you are notified you don’t have indefinite leave, you’re not allowed benefits. The exact same letter as before.“It was like deja vu.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspdidn’t know where to turn.\u0026nbspI thought it was all going to happen again. I just felt like I was being targeted.He added: “The amount of stress it’s caused me. I’ve got very high blood pressure. I just want it all to stop. I just want them to\u0026nbspleave me\u0026nbspalone,\u0026nbsplet me\u0026nbspcarry on with my\u0026nbsplife. I’ve never had a\u0026nbspproblem\u0026nbspgetting jobs\u0026nbspI don’t have a criminal record or anything like that. But I now have £5,000 worth of rent arrears because of the eight months when I wasn’t allowed to work.Government admits 63 Windrush citizens could have wrongly deportedThe most humiliating thing was having to rely on my mum.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing worse than this. She had to take on two jobs.\u0026nbspI just want to be left alone and live my life. I don’t want police kicking at my door, I don’t want any of this. Even now, to this day, until I see another letter confirming, I’m still worried it\u0026nbsphasn’t been sorted out.”Mr Lammy, whose intervention prompted the Home Office to admit they made an error on both occasions, said the way the 36 year old\u0026nbsphad been treated\u0026nbspwas “beyond comprehension”.“Following his incorrect imprisonment in a detention centre, and an apology from the Immigration Minister, Franklin had begun to stitch his life back together, said the Labour MP.\u0026nbsp“To receive yet another letter, after this, declaring him invalid to work or study in the UK and threatening yet more detention, tore his life into pieces once again.Even despite numerous scandals this year, the Home Office continues to be rotten with incompetence. Franklin deserves another apology and serious compensation for the trauma he has been put through.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

I’ve said before we’d not stand in the way of a second referendum, a so-called People’s Vote, I think the SNP\u0026nbspMPs would undoubtedly vote for it.”\u0026nbspShe went on to say that the party would want to talk to allies about how Scotland would avoid finding itself in a position where the outcome of a new referendum forced it to leave the EU, regardless of whether Scottish voters had backed such a move.It\u0026nbspcame after the Westminster leader of the\u0026nbspSNP, Ian Blackford, said Scotland must have the right to vote on independence for a second time should there be a similar renewed vote on Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Blackford said the country should not be forced into accepting the result of any second Brexit referendum should Scotland again vote to remain but the majority of the UK vote to leave.Nearly 52 per cent\u0026nbspof those voting in the UK cast their ballot to leave in the 2016 referendum, but all 32 voting areas in Scotland had a majority for remain.“That would be only right and proper. There has to be the right for Scotland to call a second referendum on independence.”A YouGov poll of the SNP’s members showed on Sunday\u0026nbspthat an overwhelming majority not only support a People’s Vote on the outcome of Brexit negotiations,\u0026nbspbut also want the party’s 35 MPs in Westminster to give their positive backing for such a proposal.The poll shows that the party’s grassroots would support staying in, rather than leaving the European Union, by a margin of 93 to 7 per cent, excluding “don’t knows”,\u0026nbspif they were given the chance.A spokeswoman\u0026nbspfor the People’s Vote campaign said: “There is growing support in every part of the UK to give voters the democratic opportunity to cancel Brexit, and the SNP and people of Scotland have a crucial role to play to cleaning up a mess that is not of their making.“On this crucial issue Nicola Sturgeon is showing she is a political leaders who listens to her voters – who back a People’s Vote by a margin of more than four to one – and also her party’s members who are shown by our poll today to support giving the public a final say by an even bigger margin.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

This kind of chronic mismanagement is part of the reason why the negotiations are in such a mess.And Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: “If the EU see the Irish border backstop before parliament, there will be uproar. Parliament cannot take back control if the PM keeps her hand hidden from MPs.”At a briefing for journalists, the No 10 spokesman twice refused to say the fresh plan would be made available in the UK before the summit, on 18 October.Why a Canada-style Brexit deal would be a disaster for BritainThe end of the world will save Theresa May from BrexitDowning Street says EU too \u0027optimistic\u0027 that a Brexit deal is close“It will be published in due course – I don’t have a date for you,” he replied.The row over the Irish border proposals is likely to intensify when Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, meets Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, in Brussels on Tuesday.Meanwhile, at Westminster, the Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG) will meet to threaten a guerrilla campaign in Westminster against the prime minister’s proposals.\u0026nbspThe No 10 spokesman denied the talks were slowing down again, after it appeared plans for Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, to go to Brussels had been shelved, saying: “There are technical notices taking place this week – those talks continue.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

She was the one negotiating in Salzburg, so she should be the one explaining to MPs why she failed, a Labour source told The Independent. At this stage the PM shouldn\u0027t be running scared of Parliament.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to load.Raab set to make statement to MPs\u0026nbspon Brexit negotiations\u0026nbspMPs may not see May\u0027s fresh Brexit plans before she asks EU leaders to agree to themHillary Clinton has criticised Conservative MEPs for refusing to vote against an EU censure of the widely-criticised Hungarian government, calling their approach disheartening.Speaking at Oxford University, the former US presidential nominee said: It\u0027s disheartening to watch conservatives in Brussels vote to shield Viktor Orban from censure, including British Tories.She added: They have come a long way since the days of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill.Let\u0027s not be fooled by the masquerade that countries like Turkey and Hungary are still real democracies, just illiberal ones.Illiberal democracy is a contradiction in terms.Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is now speaking in Brussels. She says it\u0027s a seminal moment in the negotiations, and says she wants to see an agreed outcome in the Brexit talks.\u0026nbspFoster says the result must be respected, and adds she could not support any arrangement that would give rise to any customs barriers in the UK internally that would harm the Northern Irish economy.\u0026nbspShe says she reiterated her position to the PM last week. It\u0027s not just a case of barriers between NI and GB but also between GB and NI.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt comes after The Times reported this morning that a compromise solution could result in checks only on goods entering the province from the mainland but no checks on goods leaving Northern Ireland for the rest of the UK. Foster has just rejected this.\u0026nbspAsked whether she is prepared to veto a deal, Foster says she will check any deal against her party\u0027s red lines.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe need to see the text, and once we see the text we will be able to judge that, she added.\u0026nbspSpeaking on the BBC\u0027s Radio 4 Today programme earlier this morning, Steve Baker, a senior figure in the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG), said that as many as 40 Tory MPs could vote against a deal based on Theresa May\u0027s current proposals.\u0026nbspMr Baker, a former Brexit minister, said: I always try to be accurate on the numbers rather than have a bluff to be called. We are in a position where, as we roll forward, colleagues will not tolerate a half-in, half-out Brexit.I did a concrete canvas of colleagues when it was amendments to legislation, and came up with the number of nearly 80.Of course the Government are going to whip this vote extremely hard, but what I would say is that the whips would be doing incredibly well if they were to halve the numbers, and my estimate is that there are at least 40 colleagues who are not going to accept a half-in, half-out Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the Customs Union, come what may.\u0026nbspPenny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, who campaigned for Leave, has just finished a speech on aid and her thoughts on the Brexit process.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn her address, she said:\u0026nbsp The PM\u0026nbsphas my full support. I think she is working absolutely flat out to get our country the best deal possible, she said following a speech in London on future British aid following Brexit.I don\u0027t doubt her motives, I don\u0027t doubt her commitment and I don\u0027t doubt for one moment her understanding that we have to deliver a good Brexit, we have to honour that result. So she has my support and I am not in any way expecting that situation to change.Earlier she said: The PM can count on my support. But what I would say is that we don\u0027t know where this is going to end up. We are at a critical moment now. The ball is firmly back in the EU\u0027s court we are waiting for them to respond.I think that what we need to do is just support both the PM but also Dominic Raab and the negotiating team. They are trying to get the best deal for our country and, until we know what that is, I think that is the best way we can help.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The two-day affair includes at least three costume changes, three parties, three florists and, of course, lashings of celebs.But #royalwedding is not without its share of controversy.Royal Correspondent EMILY ANDREWS gives readers the low-down.EUGENIE, , has always pushed fashion boundaries – with mixed success. But now it is odds on she will have one of the world’s top designers creating her wedding dress.London-based Erdem Moralioglu dressed her for the engagement photos and is expected to have created at least one of the three dresses Eug will wear .Eugenie says her dress will have “no meringue shoulders” and will be the work of a “British-based designer”.She added: “As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer and the look.”Stella McCartney, who designed Meghan’s evening wedding gown, is in the running, alongside Jenny Packham, Phillipa Lepley, Suzanne Neville and Alice Temperley.Like every royal bride, Eugenie will wear a veil and a tiara – most likely the York Tiara which is owned by mum Fergie.The Duchess of York wore the tiara, a gt from the Queen and Prince Philip, as she wed Prince Andrew in .Eugenie’s bouquet is expected to feature York white roses, dad Andrew’s favourite gardenias, lily of the valley and a sprig of ivy to represent the couple’s marital home – Ivy Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.JACK, , may be best described as a former barman who now works for George Clooney, but his ancestors are just as illustrious as his fiancée’s.Named after his great-grandfather Sir Jack Coke, he is related to the princess through Viscount Powers­court as well as the Earl of Harewood.Wealthy in their own right, his family are stalwarts of the Cha scene.He met Eugenie in the posh Swiss ski resort of Verbier in .Like her, he’s a daredevil skier and enjoys partying.He used to manage Mayfair club Mahiki and now acts as brand ambassador for Casamigos tequila, co-founded by George Clooney and Rande Gerber, aka Mr Cindy Crawford.Like Eug, he went to a posh schooland loves country pursuits such as fishing and shooting.He even has his own coat of arms, complete with a severed deer’s head, so he fits right in with the royals.LIKE Harry and Meghan’s May wedding, Jack and Eugenie’s ceremony will be in St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.Starting at am, it will be a traditional service with the Dean of Windsor officiating. Archbishop of York John Sentamu has written a special prayer. A sprinkling of showbiz will come from Italian opera superstar Andrea Bocelli, who will sing two songs during the service.State trumpeters from the Band of the Household Cavalry will perform a fanfare during the service.And the Grenadier Guards, of which Prince Andrew is Colonel, will line the West Steps as the couple leave as man and we. The bridal party will be very much a family affair. Big sister Beatrice, , will be maid of honour, while Jack’s younger brother Tom, , is reported to be best man.Five-year-old Prince George reprises his role as page boy, while Princess Charlotte, three, Maud Windsorand Robbie Williams’ six-year-old daughter Theodora “Teddy” are expected to be flower girls. HARRY and Meghan had a modest  guests, while Eugenie and Jack are taking their list up to , with all the senior royals present – except one.Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, raised eyebrows when she said she would be attending a school harvest festival in Scotland instead.Even Prince Philip – who will usually not be in the same room as Fergie – is turning up on Friday for his granddaughter’s big day.Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas is one of Eugenie’s best pals, while another of his ex-squeezes, singer Ellie Goulding, is also a friend. Other pop stars on the list include James Blunt and EdSheeran.Fergie’s friendship with supermodel Naomi Campbell almost certainly guarantees her an invite.Model Cara Delevingne and Poldark actress Gabriella Wilde are also expected to be there. Given the groom’s job with their tequila brand, George and Amal Clooney, Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber should be present.Robbie Williams and we Ayda Field are friends of Fergie, while the Beckhams were said to have been invited but can’t make it.The parents of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who was killed by an allergic reaction to a sandwich, have also been invited after Fergie met them on the plane as they were bringing home the -year-old’s body.Despite , members of the public being invited to attend in the grounds of Windsor Castle, hotels in the area are slashing prices this week after a lack of interest.IT would not be a wedding. let alone a royal one, without a controversy or two. And with Air Miles Andy and Freebie Fergie at the helm, Jack and Eug’s big day has not escaped a bit of carping.The Duke of York was desperate for his daughter’s wedding to be broadcast on the BBC, but talks broke down. The broadcaster eventually refused as it felt the lack of public interest would mean it didn’t get bang for its buck.With only weeks to go, Andrew told Buckingham Palace courtiers that it had to be televised somehow. At the last moment, ITV’s This Morning picked up the baton.The wedding will be shown in America by TLC, a gloriously trashy channel, responsible for shows such as Dr Pimple Popper, Sister Wives,  Day Fiancé and My lb Le.Security for the wedding is said to cost £million and will be funded by UK taxpayers, to the annoyance of pressure groups such as anti-monarchy Republic, which says it is a waste of money.More than , people have signed its petition saying there should be no public funding. It is worth bearing in mind that Harry and Meghan’s wedding cost taxpayers around £million.The rest of Eug’s big day is estimated at £.million, which is being paid for by the Queen and the Duke of York. However, Andrew likes to get help with his financial outlay, so there may well be a Hello! photoshoot on the cards.Camilla missing the wedding is also something of a mystery.The Duchess says her prior engagement was booked months agobut sources close to the Yorks were said to be astonished when they heard she was not attending.They apparently asked her to reconsider, but Camilla did not want to let down the pupils at their school harvest festival.Jack will not be given a royal title, but Eugenie is certainly not giving up hers.While most posh Sloanes would become Mrs Jack Brooksbank, Eug will still be titled Princess Eugenie of York.HARRY and Meghan had two parties, Jack and Eug will have three.First up is a formal post-wedding lunch hosted by the Queen at ­Windsor Castle. Then on Friday evening, Andrew and Fergie will host a black-tie reception at the family home of Royal Lodge, Windsor, where both still live despite their orce in .Anyone still standing will be invited toto Royal Lodge on ­Saturday afternoon for what is billed as a “festival and funfair” themed party.This third celebration has been organised by Bentleys Entertainment – the A-list party planning firm founded by Peregrine Armstrong-Jones, who created the Beckhams’ ­wedding spectacular back in .It will feature dodgems, coconut shies and food stalls plus “loads of cocktails including bloody Marys for the hangovers”. While HM needed only one of Windsor’s state apartments, St George’s Hall, to toast the happy couple post chapel, Eugenie and Jack’s wedding party are taking over three – adding the Grand Reception Room and Waterloo Chamber, where guests will be served champagne, ­canapés and wedding cake.And that cake will be a chocolate and red velvet sponge, decorated with the “rich colours of autumn” and sprigs of ivy.No expense has been spared on the floral ­decorations with Eugenie deciding that a ­princess needs three luxury florists. Elton John fave Rob van Helden will be arranging the blooms at St George’s, alongside Mayfair firm Pulbrook  Gould and Paul Thomas at Royal Lodge.Given the spectacular flower arches that were created for Harry and Meghan, you can bet Rob will want to go onebetter.Is that because Eugenie and Jack have a low profile We took a photo of the couple out on the streets of London to find outthe public actually know who the royal couple are.And the result  Out of  people questioned, only three could name her and NOBODY recognised him.Builder Alan Smith, , guessed the woman in the picture was an actress.He then added: “I had no idea her wedding was on Friday. I certainly didn’t get an invite.”Fellow builder Richard Adams, , said: “I thought she might be someone in the Cabinet and that maybe he was a comedian.”Sam Scales, a -year-old student from Australia, said: “I think she’s a princess. I couldn’t name her but bloody hell she’s got some chompers on her.”His Aussie mate, Matthew Thompson, added: “Didn’t she wear a bad hat once “He looks like Shrek when he goes to human form – or a combination of Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch.”Accountant Nyasha Masalagc, , said: “I’ve never seen them before in my le. Is she an actress and he a politician ”David Connor, a -year-old taxi driver, said: “That’s Fergie’s daughter. I don’t know the bloke’s name but I know he’s loaded and that’s why she’s marrying him.”Investment banker Alec Murray-Brown, , recognised her. He said: “My sister is a huge fan of the royals so I know all of them. I’m not sure of his name but he’s wearing a signet ring. He’ll be aristocratic.”And Lewis Edwards, a -year-old plumber, said: “Not a clue.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ball is firmly back in the EUs court - we are waiting for them to respond.I think that what we need to do is just support both the PM but also Dominic Raab and the negotiating team.They are trying to get the best deal for our country and, until we know what that is, I think that is the best way we can help.Mrs May has repeatedly insisted that Chequers is now the only Brexit deal on the table.But Ms Mordaunts comments will encourage Tory Brexiteers who want the PM to put forward an alternative looser trade agreement.She also piled pressure on Mrs May with a warning she must deliver the motives and ambition of the  referendum - and said the Government must not punish voters for backing Brexit.Ms Mordaunt said: I believe in honouring the result we must also honour the motives and ambitions of that historic decision.Over the last year, there has been a mischaracterisation of the British people and their reason for choosing to leave. Youd be wrong to interpret Brexit as protectionist, nationalist or selfish.Just as youd be wrong to interpret the scepticism some of the public have about aspects of UK aid to a lack of love or logic on their part.Brexiteers and aid sceptics are not uncaring, selfish little Englanders. Indeed, it is often those very people who give the greatest percent of their income to help others.Its just that they believe its not government that binds nations together. Its trade, and its our common humanity. Its not government that employs people, its business, its not government who has all the power, its the people.Its not government that enables compassion, its people and their taxes.Andthe people tell you what they want they dont want a government to punish them for it. They just want them to get on with it. Government is not the master, the people are.Ms Mordaunt is one of just two Cabinet ministers who have never publicly backed Chequers, prompting speculation she could quit over the PMs plan.During her speech today, she also announced new plans - first revealed by The Sun - to put more private cash into foreign aid so the Government spends less."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004403408092.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"woman stunned to find giant 12cm bran flake in her tesco cereal","story":"Hungry zoo worker Emma Baker poured out a portion of the Tesco cereal and was stunned to discover the monster cm by cm flake lurking in the bowl.Emma, from Farnham, Surrey, held up the super-sized flake to her -year-old mother Connie Baker.The -year-old said: “I poured the cereal out and couldn’t believe how big it was.“I was like ‘oh my God, I think I’ve found the world’s biggest bran flake’.“I held it up to my mum as she didn’t believe me at first.“I couldn’t believe it myself and knew my friends would have a laugh at it, so that’s why I took pictures of it.”Emma, who bought the p box of own brand bran flakes from the Aldershot branch of Tesco, shunned the opportunity to flog the flake online and instead devoured it over breakfast.She said: “I did eat it.

Last week, Banksy destroyed one of his prints via a remote device seconds after it sold in London. Auction house Sothebys admitted being Banksy-ed when a canvas of Girl With Balloon self-destructed the moment it sold for pound. million on Friday night. The art collector hoped by copying the prank, he would double the prints value.  But it has now been valued to be worth less than pound. And experts have now warned people not to repeat the prank. A blog post on MyArtBroker reads: Weve had a number of Banksy print owners contact us today askingthey shred their artwork will it be worth more. Please, please dont. The events of the last hrs are a very unique piece of art history. On Saturday evening, Banksy posted a video on his Instagram page which showed a shredder being fitted to the frame of his painting. It opened with the caption: A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting.  The clip shows a hooded figure putting the finishing touches on the device, before text appears on the screen saying: In case it was ever put up for auction. Camera-phone footage from inside the auction house in London then follows, capturing the moment a beeping siren sounded as the gavel hits. The stencil spray paining - which depicts a girl reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon - suddenly passes through the covert shredder and hangs limply from the bottom.

Exasperated locals in the hamlet of Tregatillian, just outside of St Columb Major, Cornwall, are at their wits end from the constant glare of the lights. They claim the man has had the illuminations on and flashing brightly almost every night since they were erected in November last year. And when asked when they would be finally coming down, he allegedly laughed and replied: Every time you complain, I’ll put more up.One local told Cornwall Live : We can’t reason with him. The lights in the scenic hamlet - reportedly put up six weeks before Christmas last year - are also said to have driven wildle out of the area. Joanne and Geoff Britton, who moved to the area four years ago to live a quieter le, said the illuminations were spoiling their retirement. “It’s a nightmare,” Joanne said. “I approached [him] at the end of January and said, ‘how much longer are we going to have these lights up  and he just laughed and said, ‘every time you complain, I’ll put more up’. We can’t reason with him. “We live in a park where you can only liveyou are over . When we first moved in, there was no light. If there was, I certainly wouldn’t have bought this place. We are in the middle of the country, where most people live because they want the rural environment.  She added: “It was bad in February and March, when it got dark in the late afternoon and the lights came on. He puts them on when it gets dark and switches them off when he goes to bed. “In the summer our neighbour Pat, who also lives in France, was dreading coming back. Her house is directly opposite the neighbour’s, and the lights shine straight onto a mirror in her dining room, so all you can see on the TV is flashing lights. Locals claim the lights, which are attached to both sides of the neighbour’s property - flash continuously at night. Resident Pat Treton said: Ive no idea why hes doing it. Its really irritating - the lights are on all the time.  Were surrounded by countryside but its driven all the wildle away. Ive lived in dferent places but never known anything like this. Joanne also claimed the lights have had an impact on wildle. “We came here because it’s out in the country and we like wildle like bats and owls, and it just spoils the whole country atmosphere, it just ruins everything, she said. “The owls used to go in the tree and hoot at night but now they’ve gone. They don’t like it.” Joanne stressed that she has nothing against Christmas lights during the festive season. “At least you know they are going to come down in early January,” she said.  “But it’s every night for nearly a year.It’s beyond a joke and I can’t understand it. “Everyone  has to suffer with this continual flashing, which reflects all around the park. It’s like the Blackpool illuminations.” The Brittons claimed they had tried to contact both the owners of the park, Turners Parks Group, and an environmental protection officer at Cornwall Council. But they said so far they’ve hit a brick wall. “The park owners looked into it and said it would cost too much money to deal with legally,” Joanne claimed.  “Cornwall Council said there was nothing they could do. “We’ve also written a letter to Cornwall Council leader Adam Paynter and local MP Steve Double. “We’ve gone down all the avenues but we are getting nowhere. A Turners Parks Group representative said the group did not wish to comment. Cornwall Live has attempted to contact Cornwall Council and the unidentied neighbour for comment.

The Duke of York and his family live at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park which has its own romantic neo-gothic church in the grounds where the Queen regularly goes to pray. A royal insider claims thatEugenie held her wedding there instead of at Windsor Castle then the police would not have had to foot the multimillion-pound bill. Eugenie, , and tequila brand ambassador Jack Brooksbank, , will marry inside St Georges Chapel on Friday - the same place where Prince Harry and Meghan wed in May.  The royal source however claimed it made perfect sense both cost and security wise for the royal wedding to be held at the same venue as the reception at Royal Lodge. He said: “If the Royal Chapel of All Saints is good enough for the Queen to go to church in every Sunday then it should be good enough for the th in line to the throne to marry in. “It is a wonderful chapel and when the Queen Mother who lived in Royal Lodge before Prince Andrew died in , she was laid out on the altar there before her funeral. “Princess Eugenie is having her wedding reception at Royal Lodge so it makes perfect sense to have the wedding there as well as it would be all self-contained for the whole day.  “Royal Lodge is inside Windsor Great Park so there would be no need for anything like the major security operation that is in progress for her wedding inside Windsor Castle. The source added: The security would be simple and cheap because it would all take place on a secure royal estate and it would need such a massive police operation as it would not be public. “There would be no need for a carriage procession through the streets of Windsor for a minor royal so no police protection headache and poundm saving to hard pressed police. “The Royal Wedding for Prince Harry and Meghan was a very dferent affair and their status entirely dferent and it generated a huge amount of money to the UK economy.  “But is there really a need for Princess Eugenie to have an open top carriage ride for half a mile through the High Street when she could have the whole shebang in her own garden  “She would have won herself a lot of supportersshe chose that option. Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York live in Royal Lodge with daughters Eugenie and Beatrice, and it is in Windsor Great Park three-and-a-half miles from the Castle itself. The Royal Chapel of All Saints is a Grade II listed building and was built on the orders of George IV in  by Jeffry Wyatville and nestles in the grounds of the Royal Lodge. Royal Lodge was popular with William IV and King George VI and his we Queen Elizabeth and when she was widowed and became Queen Mother she moved in.  The Queen visits the Royal Chapel every Sunday without fail to pray when she is staying at Windsor Castle then had lunch with her mother afterwards until her death aged . Pews for the Royal Family run down the right hand side of the church and Crown Estate workers who live in Windsor Great Park use the pews that run down the left hand side. The source said: “The chapel holds  people and there are lots of marquees being set up in the grounds for the reception so the wedding could have easily been relayed. The Royal Family are paying for the wedding inside Windsor Castle and the reception but the taxpayer has been left to pick up the bill for policing.  Weeks of planning have gone into keeping the royal couple and the public safe and all drains on the route have to be searched and armed and plainclothes officers brought in. Snipers will be on roofs and the force helicopter will be overhead watching for threats. The , commoners invited to stand outside St Georges Chapel will all have to be vetted and searched before entrance is allowed. The couple have invited  guests to be inside the chapel –  more than Harry and Meghan invited. A spokesperson for the Royal Family has dismissed claims that Eugenie and Mr Brooksbank were having dficulty trying to find , commoners to actually turn up for the wedding. A Windsor resident claimed on a local Facebook page that wedding planners were so desperate for guests they were inviting people who had car park passes at a royal gardens. Carolyn Osgood wrote: “You could they were scraping the barrel when they started sending out invites to people whose only connection was that they have a car park pass for Savill Gardens. True story. You couldn’t make that up!”  Savill Gardens is part of Windsor Great Park and was created by Sir Eric Savill in the ’s and is operated by the Crown Estate and a car park pass costs pound a year for entry. A spokeswoman for Eugenie said: As announced publicly last month over , applicants were received for the public ballot. As with all such occasions, the use of St George’s Chapel is in accordance with The Queen’s wishes. The Chapel has hosted the weddings of many members of the Royal Family, including The Earl and Countess of Wessex and Peter and Autumn Phillips. Meanwhile, the Queen has agreed to a drone ban being implemented by the Civil Aviation Authority over the grounds of Windsor Castle and the Windsor Castle Estate for the royal wedding. It forbids the use of unmanned aerial vehicles which can both take photos and video being flown on both the wedding day and the following day when guests leave Royal Lodge. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: “A Restriction of Flying Regulation has been granted and this will be enforced and any offenders with drones will be prosecuted. They are calling for local residents to be their “drone rangers” and report drone pilots. The spokesman said: ”Please call us immediatelyyou see a drone being flown. Police not only fear that drones could information to terrorists but that they could run out of power and drop out of the sky and injure the royal couple or well wishers on the route. They could also put police helicopters watching from above at risk of a collision.

While they are by no means identical, it is clear to see that both Eugenie and Kate Middletons engagement rings share several similarities - theyre similar in size, have a flower-like quality about them and both have a striking coloured stone at their centre.And theres a very good reason for this.Eugenies ring isnt intended as a copy of the Duchess of Cambridges, but instead as a copy of another iconic ring - one that belonging to her mother, Sarah Ferguson.When Prince Andrew proposed to Fergie in March , he gted her a sparkling ring designed by Garrard  Co that featured a large ruby stone, surrounded by a halo of  diamonds. Some may recall that Garrard  Co also created the ring worn today by Kate, which previously belonged to Princess Diana and as both rings were made in the s it is understandable that they would share many similarities in terms of style. Jamie Samhan, the deputy editor at Royal Central further explained the situation to Marie Clare. She said: Many people noticed the resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridges engagement ring, that once belonged to Diana, Princess of Wales. The reason that they look very much the same is that Dianas ring was by Garrard  Co in  and Sarahs ring was from the same designer a few short years later in . Prince Andrew did personally design the ring that was given to Fergie, compared to Dianas that was from the collection, but most designers tend to stick to a signature style. So when Jack set out to create a ring for Eugenie just like her mothers, the groundwork that it would also resemble Diana Kates ring was already there. Eugenie and Jack are set to tie the knot on Friday, October  at Windsor Castles St Georges Chapel.

School chiefs claim they want to help cash-strapped families save money by telling all parents to kit their children out in casual sportswear. If the plans are approved, pupils will wear blue-and-white tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie top emblazoned with the school crest. The current policy of pupils wearing black shoes will also be ditched in favour of non-branded white or black trainers. Parents have been asked to vote on the proposals - which have the backing of governors - which could come into force next year. Telford Junior School, in Leamington Spa, Warks., says the new unorm would consist of tracksuit bottoms, trainers, white sports socks, hoodie or zoodie in school colours with the school logo.  Last week headteacher Richard Siviter wrote to parents, saying: This unorm would be worn throughout the day, without the need to change into games kit for PE games lessons. Lists the advantages of the sportswear unorm, Mr Siviter claims it simplies the school unorm and reduces costs to families. It also says it will save valuable lesson time and overcomes the issue of changing in school and reduces lost property while maintaining a unorm code.  But parents have reacted with outrage at the plans, saying tracksuits will lower standards and sends out the wrong message to pupils. Mum-of-two Michelle Jackson, , fumed: Tracksuits are fine for PE but not appropriate for a classroom. Whats wrong with wearing a unorm  Children should learn how to look smart and take a pride in their appearance. Unless were preparing for the next generation to be PE teachers or drug dealers then I think a traditional unorm is best.

But for the people watching at home, their presence might prompt memories of a more troubled time for the royal family. The Duke and Duchess of York , now both aged , tied the knot in  - but just six years later their marriage ended in scandal. Ferguson, more commonly known as Fergie, and Prince Andrew announced their separation in March . Five months later, the Duchess was embroiled in arguably the Royal familys biggest ever scandal when compromising photographs with her financial advisor, taken at her holiday villa in St Tropez, were published in the Daily Mirror.  The intimate pictures, shot with a telephoto lens as the couple lazed by the pool, show Texan millionaire John Bryan kissing and sucking the Duchess toes and the arch of her foot. They also showed the couple kissing and embracing, and frolicking in the pool. In one image, two-year-old Princess Eugenie watched on as Mr Bryan kissed her mother on the lips. Never before had a Royal been seen in this light.  On the morning the photographs were published, Sarah Ferguson was staying at Balmoral with the rest of the royal family. Royal writer Richard Kay claimed in the Daily Mail that he received a message via pager from Princess Diana the night before the photos hit the newspaper stands. Dianas message was simple: The redheads in trouble. He then got a call from John Bryan askinghe could obtain an early copy of the Mirror so he could see what was being said. Kay obliged, rushing to Bryans flat just as he received a call from a concerned Sarah Ferguson.  Bryan promised her everything would be fine, but I could see in his face that he didn’t really believe it, Kay wrote. In a few short hours, those pictures were going to be on the breakfast room sideboard in the Queen’s castle. They would also be winging around the world to be pored over by millions. But there was one thing in particular that annoyed Bryan as he surveyed the media coverage. According to Kay, he said: I wasn’t sucking her toes, I was kissing them! Fergie hastily left the Scottish holiday home in the morning and drove the  miles to Aberdeen airport with her children and nanny.  But when she eventually arrived at her Surrey house, there was more embarrassment for the Duchess as nobody was there to open the gates. Instead of shooting past the reporters and photographers lining up outside, she was forced to sit while a detective got out of the car to unlock the barrier. After four years of separation, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew officially announced their decision to orce in May .  She has retained her title Duchess of York but ceased being a Royal Highness. Should Sarah marry again, she will also lose her Duchess title. Years after their split, Fergie claimed the marriage was troubled due to her husbands prolonged periods away from home. She explained: What I got was not the man, I got the palace and didnt get him. Sarah still attends s with daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie and in  was invited to stay at Balmoral as a guest of the Queen.

The loving youngster was killed instantly in the devastating accident, which occurred after the vehicle hit a patch of gravel on October , . A kind-hearted and popular child with a strong faith, her last words to her mum earlier that day had been: You know, mom, I really am a God girl.

Bridget, , goes on to tell the funeral director that although they see the absolute worst le has to offer, they arent hardened, nor cold, nor angry. She says they told her to hold on to her last, stunning memory of Avery - beautul and apparently bathed in golden light on the day of her death. I wasnt able to see Avery after - in fact, you looked me right in the eyes and asked me what my last memory of her was, the single mum writes. She adds: Hold on to that, you said. You dont need this. I knew what you meant. You were saving me from a memory I didnt need to have. You took on for yourself what you knew I shouldnt have to be hurt by. An image that no mother should ever have to face. How many times have you done that  How many times have you chosen the heartache for yourself to save a stranger from theirs She concludes the message - originally posted on her Stumbling Towards Perfect blog - by thanking the director for tucking Avery in one very last time. Bridget, also mum to Jadrian, , and nine-year-old Brody McCarthy, lost her precious daughter just  days after her th birthday. She had dropped off amazing fth-grader Avery at Delavan Christian School in their hometown of Delavan, Wisconsin, earlier that day. It was hours later that the fatal accident occurred, as the youngsters doting older sister drove her back to their home from a gymnastics class. Just minutes after leaving the gym, the car hit some gravel and smashed into a utility pole near Whitewater, killing the little girl instantly.

Below, you can read Bridgets heartwrenching message to her daughters funeral director in full... blog here You were the very last person to ever touch my daughter on earth. You took her stilled, silent body and you washed her. You changed her into the clothes I had brought over in a brown paper bag. Her favorite blue jeans, a bright blue t-shirt with a tank top underneath. Years later, Id panic, convinced I had forgotten to bring fresh, clean underwear. I contacted the people at the funeral home - can you believe weve become such good friends  I was told that when a family forgets something like that, they simply discretely provide it. You helped me to understand that it was okay to put fuzzy socks on her feet. You patiently slipped them on her. You took the down comforter I passed to your hands and listened as I explained through choppy breaths and a stream of tears that shed need to be wrapped up in it - like a burrito. Because thats how she watched TV. Burrito wrapped in her blanket. You wrapped her up tightly. And you laid her down gently for the very last time.  I honestly have no idea what compels someone to become a funeral director. I cant imagine many high school career counselors hear that one. In your case, this was a family business, but you could have done anything. Instead, you chose to comfort the brokenhearted. You chose a profession where you see people at their weakest and most vulnerable. During the times where we are so lost we have literally no idea how we will behave. Some sit stone still, others rage. Some cry, others are in denial. Families fight in front of you, bringing up old, unnecessary wounds when all that should be done is to write the obituary and get it into the paper. You see the absolute worst le has to offer. A front and center seat to the most horrible of all horribles. Children. Innocents. Disease. Accidents. Heartache. Fathers. Mothers. And those so alone no one comes to cry for them at all. And yet, you arent hardened. You arent cold. You arent even angry. In fact, it seems the exact opposite that your heart continues to grow and grow with unlimited compassion and a gentleness that seems to be unattainable for the rest of us. You love strangers in the most intimate of ways. You care for them. And you do it so gently. So beautully. Asyou know how truly honorable it is to dress the dead.  I wasnt able to see Avery after -- in fact, you looked me right in the eyes and asked me what my last memory of her was. I told you about that morning. How stunningly beautul I noticed her to be. That she seemed bathed in golden light when she was standing at the bathroom mirror, when she was sitting in the passenger seat flicking on the CD. That light followed her all morning. I told you how she took my breath away when she sang. How I caught a glimpse of her as her older self but not quite - she looked like an angel. I explained how my words were at a complete loss when she looked back as she got out of the car: You know, Mom, I really am a God Girl. I smiled and shook my head, this sweet, sweet girl of mine, as she skipped away. Hold on to that, you said. You dont need this. I knew what you meant. You were saving me from a memory I didnt need to have. You took on for yourself what you knew I shouldnt have to be hurt by. An image that no mother should ever have to face. How many times have you done that  How many times have you chosen the heartache for yourself to save a stranger from theirs   I cant imagine its easy for you. In a society where were keen on asking what people do for a living and griping about our jobs at dinner parties, where do you fit  When you havent been to any of your childs soccer games and you miss the parent-teacher conference because youre answering someone s crisis, how do you reconcile that  When you have to ditch last minute because a strangers funeral had to be held that particular day, what do you feel when the pictures come back and your date is, once again, alone  How many people have you cared for, comforted, held up and yet they look away awkwardly when you pass them in the grocery store or at the gas station - not because of anything more than theyre just trying desperately to figure out their new normal and theyre afraid theyre going to lose it so they pretend not to see you because thats the only way they know how to deal  How many times have you been avoided simply because of the job you do  I imagine it might be very lonely for you at times. I want to tell you thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I hope you know that what you do for others - what you did for me - will always mean more than anyone can ever explain. Thank you for choosing the hard road, the dficult journey. Thank you for showing up and taking the lead when everyone  is lost and has no idea what to do. Thank you for staying late. Thank you for listening to our stories. Thank you for making us feel that we matter. Thank you for your professionalism. Thank you for your kindness. And thank you for your compassion. And, thank you, for tucking Avery in one very last time.

In the shocking video footage, a massive wall of water can be seen approaching behind some trees, as screaming locals run for their lives. One of those fleeing appears to be a parent carrying a young child. While people on the ground desperately search for a safe place to hide, others, on higher ground, can be heard shouting for them to run faster.  Moments later, the water smashes through the trees and sweeps through the streets of Palu, where terried locals had just been running. At one point in the footage, the camera lens goes black - with loud bangs, horried screams and gushing water heard in the background. The lens then focuses on the water surging down the streets, carrying debris with it, according to the clip, which has been shared online. The official death toll in Sulawesi currently stands at , following the quake and tsunami on September , with most of the fatalities in Palu. The small city bore the brunt of the disaster, which saw many people trapped under fallen masonry and rubble after the quake struck first.  One resident has since recalled: “The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell. People were trapped and buried under collapsed houses. I could do nothing to help.” On October , four days after the quake and ft-high tsunami hit the city, Indonesian soldiers started digging a ft-long trench. It was to act as a mass grave for the hundreds of dead. And today, a week and a half on from the tragedy, Indonesia ordered independent foreign aid workers to leave the quake zone. The country has traditionally been reluctant to be seen as relying on outside help to cope with disasters.  The government shunned foreign aid this year when earthquakes struck the island of Lombok. But it has accepted help from abroad to cope with the aftermath of the latest quake and tsunami. Despite this, some foreign groups say they have faced dficulties getting entry permits to bring in staff and equipment, and there has been confusion about the rules. There have long been restrictions on the activity of foreign aid workers.In a notice posted on Twitter , the national disaster agency set the rules out for foreign non-governmental organisations .Foreign groups are not allowed to go directly to the field but must conduct all activities in partnership with local partners, it said.  Foreign citizens who are working with foreign NGOs are not allowed to conduct any activity on the sites affected, it added. In its English-language notice, the agency also said foreign NGOs who have deployed its foreign personnel are advised to retrieve their personnel immediately. No one knows how many people are missing following the disaster, especially in areas of southern Palu devastated by soil liquefaction. However, the number could be as high as ,, the national disaster agency said. Meanwhile, about , people have been displaced. A few foreign aid workers have been in the disaster zone, including some searching for survivors in the ruins of collapsed buildings in Palu.  Many of the displaced in Sulawesi are living in basic shelters in the city and surrounding hills, with a plan to relocate communities being drawn up. The government has allocated  billion rupiahfor quake relief and has said some  countries have offered help. Sulawesi is one of Indonesias five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami. In , a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed , people in  countries. The toll included more than , in Indonesia. Foreign governments and aid groups played a big role in the emergency response and recovery efforts that year.

The secretive state and the Vatican have no formal diplomatic relations.South Korean President Moon Jae-in is said to be delivering Kims invitation when he meets the pontf next week during a trip to Europe.Speaking at a news briefing, Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said: President Moon will visit the Vatican on October  and  to reaffirm its blessing and support for peace and stability of the Korean peninsula.  Especially when he meets with Pope Francis, he will convey Chairman Kims message that he will ardently welcome himhe visits Pyongyang. Kim told Moon of his wish to meet the pope during last months summit of the two leaders, the spokesman added, without elaborating on the timing. The pope has said he wants to visit Japan next year. The Vatican said in a statement that the pope will receive Moon at noonon October . The day before, in St. Peters Basilica, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state and the popes second-in-command, will say a Mass for Peace on the Korean peninsula.  Moon will attend the Mass, the Vatican said. North Koreas constitution guarantees freedom of religion as long as it does not undermine the state. However, beyond a handful of state-controlled places of worship, no open religious activity is allowed. The invitation to the pope is the first by a North Korean leader since . Although that meeting, proposed by Kims father, Kim Jong Il, never materialised, the plan for Francis to visit is the Norths latest diplomatic initiative this year. Kim held an unprecedented summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, and pledged to work toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.  While Kims actions since have fallen short of Washingtons demands, the Trump administration is preparing for a second summit. Before they turned the page on decades of public acrimony, the leaders regularly traded threats and insults as North Korea pushed to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States.

The -storey Ponte City tower in Johannesburg, South Africa, looms over the city from the rough suburb of Berea. Soaring to m , the building has been used as a location for the sci-fi thriller District  and horror film Resident Evil. Architect Dimitar Karanikolov captured this series of sublime images in May after a trip to the country to photograph wildle. The -year-old, from London said: Ponte City tower is probably the most amazing and also terrying piece of dystopian architecture Ive ever seen.  Built in , the cylindrical skyscraper was intended to be a prime location in what, at the time, was an up-and-coming area of the nations largest urban centre. But a steep rise in crime in the s saw gangs move in, turning Ponte City into a vertical slum. As the building fell further into decay and disrepair, its hollow centre was reportedly filled with so much rubbish that it reached to the fth floor.  At one point, there were even proposals to turn it into a high-rise prison. Although the building has been renovated in recent years - with residents gradually ing - the area still has its problems. Dimitar said: We were told we should not go alone in this neighbourhood and especially this building as it is too dangerous. Even our taxi driver was surprised we wanted to get to this part of the town.  He eventually arranged to go with Dlala Nje, an organisation that works with children in the area and does guided tours of the tower. Dimitar said: I was sure it would be a very photogenic space and an exciting place to see. I specialise in architectural visualisation, which is more or less virtual photography. The same principles of composition, light and colour apply in my daytime job as in classic photography.  Images taken on his Leica Q with a mm lens show the circular floors ascending towards the blinding daylight from the darkness of its base. One vertigo-inducing picture taken from one of the upper floors makes the interior look like a bottomless well. Others show his guides posing on the unfinished rock of the ground floor, craning their necks upwards. Dimitar said: Ponte city is a photographers dream - a surreal space with great textures, light and context.

Deacon’scoincided with Dundee’s first league victory of the season – could he be the piece that’s been missing from their Premiership jigsaw The -year-old, who signed from English National League side Sutton United last summer, has missed the entire start of the season after having ankle surgery.Picking up the injury in the final game of last season, the enigmatic attacker ed for the final six minutes of the club’s first league win of the season – at the seventh time of the asking – at Hamilton and, in the process, set up the second goal.And hiswas hailed by manager Neil McCann.He said: “Roarie Deacon I am really pleased about getting back in because we have suffered some real injury problems of late.“He hadn’t featured at all, he’d only had  minutes of football all season before Saturday but I knew putting him on he could secure the ball because he is so strong.“You can’t get close to Roarie and he turned the boy beautully, then he had the composure.“I have to commend the other boys as well because they were still trying to get into the box at that stage to get the killer goal.”Deacon himself was delighted to be back in action after his y spell out.A process that was extended after an older injury reared its head once more.His debut season was also curtailed by injury with a troublesome thigh problem picked up in December at Hearts keeping him out of action for a big chunk of the middle of the campaign.And, on histo training this season, he hurt the same thigh once more.Deacon said: “I had ankle surgery the first week into pre-season.“I twisted it and damaged ankle ligaments in the game against Partick and through the summer it didn’t heal itself.“The surgeon didn’t want to operate initially but it didn’t heal itself so we made the decision to go under the kne to sort it out.“I was supposed to be back a little earlier than this but on the first session back I re-injured my thigh, a problem I had last season, so I needed a bit of intense rehabilitation on that to get back.“Now, though, I am ready to go and I’m fit.”With goals being a real issue for the side – just four scored in their seven league games and half of them against Accies at the weekend – Deacon’sis a timely boost for the Dark Blues.In fact, he’s only played around six minutes this season but has already had a hand in a quarter of their league goals.Coming into the side struggling for goals and points, though, hasn’t ruffled Deacon in any way.And Dundee fans will be hoping his direct running and ability to go past people is the key that unlocks defences with tough matches against Kilmarnock on Saturday and then Livingston, Hearts and Celtic in the next month.The former Sutton man admits he’s surprised the Dark Blues find themselves bottom of the table as he s to fitness and has backed them to get up the table,they keep doing what they’ve been doing.He added: “I am very surprised, everyone is surprised.“No way we thought we would come in, do well in pre-season, and then come in and after six games not have a point on the board.“However, after Hamilton everyone is positive, you can’t not be because the way we’ve been playing it’s not like we’ve not created chances or played well despite not getting points.“Everyone is buzzing about in training, raring to go and wanting to do well for Dundee.”"},{"url":null,"title":"local economy could get

Job losses nationally are said to be in the region of  after Homebase entered into a company voluntary arrangement following \"under-performance of the business\".The applicant outlines that there is no demand for the store to be re-let as a single unit and iding the unit into two would help avoid the potential for a long-term vacancy.It is thought splitting the space would make it more appealing to potential tenants.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said: \"If iding the unit into two makes it more attractive then that is a good move to make.\"I believe one of the occupiers is likely to be another DIY store but I do not know what the other store would be.\"The main problem for the retail park has been the increase in online shopping.

For a store like Homebase people were likely to drive there to get whatever they needed.\"The applicant suggested that despite the \"centre first\" policy this move would not be a problem because no new floor space is being created.The existing floor space would simply be split into two separate retail units.Mr Mackay said: \"It is not the type of store you would be likely to find in the city centre. I would be surprisedthe council were to reject this application.\"Mike Smith, manager of the Inverness Business Improvement District , does not support the proposal.\"In my personal opinion I do not think the plan should go ahead,\" he said.\"One of the restrictions of the retail park was that there were only to be single units in section  of the Town and Country Planning Act.

Despite suffering the dislocated shoulder the teen was still able to talk to the Evening Express immediately after his memorable first start.He said: “It is the first time I have done my shoulder.“It popped out when I went down. It wasn’t nice and was pretty sore.“I was just lying there on the pitch and thankfully it popped back in itself when I stood up so hopefully it is not too bad. I can move about so hopefully I will be okay as we have the international break coming up.”McLennan made his Dons debut in a - away defeat to St Johnstone in April  when coming off the bench late on.He featured as a substitute in the - Betfred Cup defeat of St Mirren last month. That was the only game time for the Reds until his start at the weekend.Now that he has made that breakthrough the teen is determined to fight to retain his spot in McInnes’ starting line-up.He said: “This is a massive club with massive players so there is competition day in, day out.“There is so much talent and depth in the squad but hopefullyI get the chance again I will go on and take it.”McLennan underlined his potential by netting a sublime solo goal in the - Scottish Youth Cup final defeat to Hibs at Hampden last season when he beat three challenges to score.Confirmation of his first start came just hours before the St Mirren game when strikers James Wilson and Stevie May were both ruled out late on by injury.McLennan said: “I only found out before the game that I was going to start so there wasn’t time to get nervous.“I turned  on the day before the game – I’m feeling old now.“For my goal the ball came through and I thought I would just hit it. I didn’t really see the ball go in to be honest as the defender was blocking me.“The main thing was to get three points and get ourselves back up the league table.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment.

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net. And the Pipistrelles bat even received some special treatment of a cosy box and a well deserved drink before the Bat Society team popped along to get the animal back to Gotham City.  Janitor Brian said: “We knew it was there during the day but we just thought it was hanging there. “But parents said to me later on that it was still there. “We contacted the Bat Society to see what we should do as we knew they were protected. “It’s wing had actually been caught, so I had to go up beside Mr Hall and prise the window frame open with a screwdriver. “We put it into a box then Mr Hall gave it some water and later on that night we released it.” Rory added: “I spent a couple of hours and stayed with it to make sure it was calm and relaxed. “I gave it a solution of salt, sugar and warm water, which the Bat Society gave us, and it was like an energy drink for him. “Half an hour after that, I took it out and hung it out at the sensory garden and off it flew.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13347961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_nip_rgr_041018flowers_1JPG.jpg","title":"caring toryglen grans who set","story":"NewsCaring Toryglen grans who set up club for pensioners are honoured in new Reformer competitionShareByNiki Tennant:,  OCT NewsCathy and Suzanne were delighted with their flowers, presented by Cathys daughter Meika \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo caring grans, who have opened up a new world of fun and friendship for Toryglen pensioners, have become the first recipients of stunning bouquets in the Reformer’s new Say it with Flowers competition.When Meika Thomson read that the Rutherglen Reformer wanted to say ‘thanks a bunch’ every week to unsung heroeswho make a real dference to their community, she didn’t hesitate to nominate her mum Cathy and best friend Suzanne Curran for a beautul bouquet from Burnside florist, Stems.Cathy and Suzanne, who have run the Toryglen After School Care club for  years, refused to turn the other cheek when they saw pensioners from a neighbouring sheltered housing complex staying indoors, living in isolation and lacking company and companionship. Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"a-is-for-apple-day","story":"AN apple a day has been keeping the doctor away for generations.Later this month our favourite fruit will be celebrated with its very own day.With interest in food provenance never being higher, Live Borders and local growers are teaming up to provide everyone the opportunity to get to know their Coxs Pippin, Granny Smith and Pink Lady.Harestanes Countryside visitors centre, near Ancrum, will host Apple Day on Sunday, October  with over  ieties on display in the gallery.The event for all the family will celebrating locally grown apples and feature local food and drinks stalls, and live acoustic music from Borders Youth Music ForumHarestanes manager Michael Scott told us: ldquoInterest in growing your own fruit and veg and buying locally-sourced food has surged in the past few years.ldquoApple Day taps into that desire to discover new tastes and experiences and to meet and talk with local food growers and suppliers in person.ldquoAnd on top of that, itrsquos a celebration of autumn with music, games and fun for everyone.Harestanes has presented Apple Day, in partnership with Borders Organic Gardeners, since  centring on the regionrsquos rich heritage of small orchards, local food suppliers and the many benefits of gardening.Michael added: ldquoThere will also be fantastic, locally sourced produce in our cafeacute and country-inspired treats in our gt shop, which are both open all year round.\"Apple Day takes place between am and pm."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-group-welcomes-post-office-plans","story":"MEMBERS of Melrose community council have welcomed plans to move the townrsquos post office to Market Square.As previously reported, the Post Office hopes to relocate the branch to Masons of Melrose bookshop.The townrsquos postmaster, John Collins, was hoping to retire at the end of last year.But he was forced to put his leaving plans on hold after proposals to move the provision to Abbey Mill in Annay Road were abandoned ndash following objections from the local community.William Windram, chairman of Melrose and District Community Council said: ldquoIrsquom sure everyone will have now seen there are plans to move the post office to Masons of Melrose.ldquoI havenrsquot yet heard anyone say they think the move is a bad idea.

Irish environment agencies, the drive out waste crime initiative involves a series of road stops, site visits and awareness-raising activities to remind hauliers of their responsibilities and the laws.Kath McDowall from SEPArsquos Waste Crime Investigations Team told us: \"Intelligence gathered by the Le Smart Waste Project indicates that waste is being hauled from England and Wales and illegally deposited in Scotland.\"Several companies are known to be involved and many of these are under investigation by SEPArsquos Waste Crime Investigation Team for criminal offences.\"There are also indications of serious and organised crime group involvement in the transport, sale and disposal of illegal waste ndash so itrsquos vital that we work with partners across the UK to tackle this issue.ldquoWaste crime will not be tolerated and SEPA will, with its partners, pursue and take proportionate action against those who seek to profit from waste crime.Hauliers and building companies who ignore strict legislation can be hit with a fine of up to pound,, the loss of their operating licence and even a jail sentence.Agencies have been carrying out road checks on routes into Scotland in recent weeks.The multi-agency team pulled vehicles coming from Northern Ireland on ferries last month as well as making stops on the A into the Scottish Borders and Aat Gretna earlier this month.Waste crime flyers have also been distributed to service stations and truck stops either side of the England Scotland border.Lynsae Tulloch, Chief Operating Officer of the Scottish Business Resilience Centre, said: \"Illegal waste management is a blight on our environment, our local communities and businesses.\"These illegal waste sites mean foul odours, water pollution, pest infestations and the increased risk of fire, which results in essential funds from the public purse being erted to cover the clean-up costs.ldquoCritically, criminals involved in the illegal movement and disposal of waste are erting income from legitimate operators, depriving them of turnover.\"Some haulage firms are also being used to transport waste to disposal sites ndash without them even knowing theyrsquore involved in illegal activity.\""},{"url":null,"title":"portrait-of-success-for-becky","story":"A LOCAL photographer is in the frame after being recognised by her profession.Becky

in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than

phone calls from concerned constituents about the recent building work in Bowmore.It has seen a footpath being built over one side of Bowmore#s rugby pitch.I had a meeting with the Islay rugby team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this issue it has been great to hear from so many of my constituents.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"trios head shave of the century","story":"Lewis Graham, , joined

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian. You have Ormiston which has doubled or trebled in size, yoursquore going to have all these houses on the south side, and theyrsquore all still going to go down Tranent High Street.

Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday that support for independence was at historically high levels, but in early September  a YouGov poll showed support for yes at  per cent this weekendrsquos survey for The Sunday Times on the other hand shows that, even with a no-deal Brexit, support for independence would be lower than that, at  per cent. ldquoHistorically pretty much the same might be a better description.However, itrsquos worth taking a look again at exactly what the new polls say. The first one, by Survation, found that,there were an independence referendum tomorrow,  per cent would vote yes and  per cent no. Butthe UK leaves the EU as planned next year, that changes to  for yes and  for no ndash and it changes againtherersquos a no-deal, with  per cent backing yes and  per cent no. The other survey, by Panelbase, found a similar rise:the UK left the EU without a deal, support for independence would increase from  per cent in  to  per cent, while support for the Union would fall from  to .On the face of it, these look like encouraging figures for the SNP, with Brexit pushing support for independence in the right direction. ButI were a Scottish Government strategist, I might privately be a bit worried. In fact, I might even have suggested to my bosses that they keep quiet about the Survation poll, which was commissioned by the SNP, for the simple reason that it doesnrsquot show enough of what they need it to show.The problem is that the surveys do indeed appear to indicate support for the SNP and independence going up. But they also demonstrate something more disturbing for the party, which is that the expected Brexit effect on support for independence simply isnrsquot happening, or at least it isnrsquot happening to the extent that Nicola Sturgeon needs it to.This lack of a signicant Brexit bounce also emphasises the dilemmas faced by Ms Sturgeon. The party members who traipsed into the conference on Sunday and marched through Edinburgh on Saturday are nationalists because their heart tells them to be, but the First Minister takes a much more mathematical approach to the situation, led by the numbers and the probabilities.This is why we saw her shting her position on a second EU referendum at the weekend. The dficulty for Ms Sturgeon is that shersquos a declared supporter of the EU, but the very thing she appears to be fighting ndash Brexit ndash may also offer her the best chance of getting what she really wants: Scottish independence. This means she has to be careful not to fight Brexit too hard, and yet she can see that a consensus is building for a second EU referendum that it would look odd for the SNP to oppose. And so Sturgeon the mathematician nudges forward and says her MPs would support it in the Commons. Their leader there, Ian Blackford, gave the game away when he addressed the subject. ldquoWe will not obstruct a second vote on Brexit, he said ndash hardly the words of a passionate anti-Brexiteer.The weekendrsquos opinion polls throw up similar strategical problems on when to hold a second independence referendum. They do appear to show a small Brexit effect and, anecdotally, Irsquove noticed it among friends and family. Quite a few who voted no in  have told me, over a coffee , that Brexit means they might vote dferently next time. But a hypothetical vote in the pub, or indeed in an opinion poll, is not the same as the real thing, when all the old economic realities would come back. Indeed, they might be even more intense in a post-Brexit world with switherers asking themselves whether, having come out of one economic union , they want to risk coming out of another .The fact that the small rise in support for independence is based on these hypotheticals leaves Nicola Sturgeon with three equally risky options. The first is to call a referendum before the next Scottish elections in  but that would be rejected by Theresa May and probably even Jeremy Corbynhe were PM given the pressure he would face from his Scottish wing. The SNP might be able to gain some traction by fostering a grievance about the referendum being rejected in this way, but option one is essentially a dead end.The second option is one that no one expects to happen ndash a Catalan-style, unofficial referendum ndash but itrsquos the third ndash delay the referendum until after  - that is the most likely. The theory behind it, as far as some SNP strategists are concerned, is that this allows more time for Brexit to convert more no voters. The aim would also be to win the  election based on a promise to hold another independence referendum, which would make it impossible for a Prime Minister to say no.This is Nicola Sturgeonrsquos preferred option ndash she just hasnrsquot said it yet. Indeed, itrsquos never going to be easy for her to say it as long as thousands of nationalists are marching through Scottish cities. She also knows that delaying is risky ndash the Panelbase poll predicts that the independence-supporting parties will lose their majority in  there is also a danger that voters will simply get used to being outside the EU Brexit will become the new status quo.And then therersquos the awkward reality that, whatever your analysis of the new polls, there is still a working majority in Scotland opposed to independence. Ms Sturgeonrsquos gamble ndash as yet undeclared ndash is that this will change by . The problem is that, even in the face of a Tory-imposed Brexit, both sides in Scotlandlook pretty resistant to change."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-claims-that-article-50-can-keep-uk-in-eu-could-just-be-mischief-making","story":"In July  the Convention on the Future of Europe produced its Draft Treaty. This contained Article  and was signed by the President and two Vice-Presidents who were mere figureheads and by the present Lord John Kerr, the Conventionrsquos Secretary General, who was responsible for its production.With a little adjustment it was presented to member states for ratication as The Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe. This was abandoned when referendums in France and the Netherlands produced negative votes. After ious modications and rearrangements together with repeated scrutiny by the EUrsquos own legal experts, the constitution emerged re-named The European Reform Treaty, better known as The Treaty of Lisbon. It is the definitive document governing EU legislation.There is no reference in any of these versions of the treaty to a reversal of notication by a member state that has announced its intention to withdraw from the European Union, except that, after leaving, it is permitted to apply to re-join under the usual conditions for new applicants.Although a group of Scottish politicians is perfectly entitled to require clarication by the European Court of Justice, that body is qualied only to interpret, not alter, laws a treaty is surely even more inviolable Brexit lsquolikely to succeedrsquo, The Herald, October . So why has Lord Kerr, who instigated Article  devised a second referendum described as a road map to a Peoplersquos Vote, for which a new clause would need to be inserted to provide for a unilateral withdrawal of notication and which would almost certainly require a new treaty and ratication by all other member states Immediately after the UK referendum, Prime Minister Theresa May was informed that cherry-picking was inadmissible. Soit is dficult to understand her motive for insisting on the Chequers Plan, it is even more dficult to discern Lord Kerrrsquos for including in Article  the condition of a negotiated agreement between the EU and the departing member state within a time limit ndash with or without extensions ndash and between two such unequally-matched participants.Since a member state has always been entitled to leave the EU, Article  appears to a non-expert to be a recipe for confusion and hostility and Lord Kerrrsquos recent political intervention with regard to the alteration of a treaty that he was largely instrumental in producing, is either a delaying tactic or simply mischief-making.Mary Rolls, Castlegate, Jedburgh.One might think from Mr Russellrsquos letterthat the Labour Party has been arguing for European Economic Areamembership since June , except its  manesto makes not a single reference to this. Certainly, it suggests Labour would have put in place ldquofresh negotiating priorities that have a strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union, which is fine, but probably what even Leave wanted just as long as we didnrsquot have to meet the obligations.Instead, Labour has six tests but they are packed full of warm words and uncertainty. One instance is the last test: ldquoDoes it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK . This is not a matter of Yes No, but ldquohow much does it deliver for the regions and nations of the UK  ldquois it enough  and ldquois it distributed equitably round the UK , which in turn beg questions about ldquoenough and ldquoequitably. There is so much wiggle-room in this ldquotest that it tells us nothing.But most risible of all is: ldquoDoes [an agreement] deliver the exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the Single Market and Customs Union , which can only mean that, despite no longer being members of the single market, or the customs union, we would continue to get the benefits we get now as members. If one thing has become clear during the Brexit negotiations, it is that the EU will only grant access in proportion to the degree to which we follow its rules, so the same benefits means approximately the same rules. However, as non-members, for instance in the EEA, we would have limited influence on how these rules evolve in the future.Lastly, Mr Russell asserts thatmore of us had voted for Ed Miliband in  the present shambles would have been avoided, but this is misleading in two regards. First, the  Labour manesto promised an in out referendumBrussels sought to transfer more powers to itself. Secondly, evenLabour had held all  of its Scottish seats rather than only one, it would still have been  seats short of a majority.Alasdair Galloway, Silverton Avenue, Dumbarton.I AGREE with Peter R Russell that a Brexit deal to trade through the European Free Trade Agreementand the European Economic Areaseems the only way through the political quagmire we are in. Is it doable, though  Labour has no genuine positions on Brexit and appears as likely to split as the Tories are.But Peter Russell argues that Scotland should have no constitutional option other than trail along the same path as is decreed by whomever is in power at Westminster. Given the indference to Scottish sensibilities on Brexit by both Labour and Tory parties, that is a bit rich. Peter Russell also referenced Ed Miliband, who stated during the EU referendum that a dferential vote on Brexit would could lead to the end of the Union. Scotland has had no leverage whatsoever on negotiations, no participation, no recognition or status for our national interests.Why would we find that an acceptable situation to be in  My preference is for a self-governing Scotland to trade with the EU, through Efta and the EEA, maintaining our fishing grounds and commerce with the rUK: the best of all worlds.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.THERESA Mayrsquos playground jibe at the Nicola Sturgeonrsquos aim to remain in the single market and customs union as betrayal is to forget several points.

On top of that, most of the additional cases in Scotland are equal pay and we are right down the middle of that - rooting out discrimination.\"The rise in equal pay cases is particularly appropriate since it was equal pay in Dumfries  Galloway that the Supreme Court used as an example of how free access to justice for one worker seeking pay equality brings benefit for many thousands.\"The judges were right in their analysis back in  and this data shows how big landmark cases reverberate in workplaces across the entire country.\"When the fees were introduced in July , The Herald reported a drop in cases of almost  per cent year on year.This prompted claims from employment experts that thousands of workers, especially women, who had been unfairly sacked or discriminated against, were being denied access to justice.The current figures from the UK Government show a complete turnaround, with equal pay cases - including a large scale claim against Glasgow City Council - accounting for the bulk of the cases with an increase of  per cent.Unfair dismissal claims also increased by  per cent over the period, while sex discrimination claims went up by almost  per cent and disability discrimination claims almost doubled.Brian McLaughlin, an employment lawyer with Unionline Scotland, which represents members of the GMB and Communications Workers Union, said: \"This is a signicant increase which is obviously welcomed by Unionline Scotland and the GMB and CWU trade unions.\"These fees were a barrier to justice which created a signicant problem for unfairly treated employees for the best part of four years.\"This upsurge in cases shows that the fees were a clear denial of access to justice.\"Jim Stephenson, convener of the Law Society of Scotlandrsquos Access to Justice committee, added that the increase showed \"a very real need for an accessible, impartial system to resolve workplace disputes\".While David Martyn, an employment specialist with Thompsons solicitors, claimed that the fees proved to be a \"massive disincentive\" for workers.\"For someone who was only claiming say pound, and having to pay out pound in upfront fees, the risk to reward ratio really didnt make any economic sense,\" he said.He also claimed that the scrapping of the fees has had a \"signicant impact\" on the employment tribunal service in Scotland, which he described as \"stretched\".A total of  new judges have been appointed in Scotland to meet the increased demand for hearings, while several tribunal rooms at the main hearing centre in Glasgow, which were converted into office space while the fee regime was in place, have had to be reinstated.Mr Martyn said: \"The tribunal service is struggling to cope, it was almost inevitable when the fees were stopped. The staff are doing their very best but theyre certainly stretched.\"These concerns were echoed by employment specialist Stephen Miller, of Clyde  Co, who claimed the tribunal service \"has been overwhelmed by the numbers\".He added that the increase in claims would also result in businesses and organisations facing signicant costs in defending the actions."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-councils-invest-20m-to-modernise-library-service","story":"The Scottish Library and Information Councilsaid the investment showed the strong commitment of councils to public library services.Earlier this month, figures showed a dramatic increase in the number of libraries being shut - with  closed in the past two years alone.However, the latest figures show council investment has led to the building or refurbishment of  libraries since March last year.Additional funding has also been provided to modernise library services with the introduction of free public wi, D printing resources and a film education programme.Fiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, welcomed the investment - announced in Libraries Week.She said: ldquoThis week celebrates the vital role of our libraries in Scotland and the fantastic service provided by staff and volunteers.ldquoI welcome this yearrsquos focus on wellbeing, which fits in well with the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to promoting social wellbeing and tackling social isolation and inequality through increased access to library services.ldquoSince , we have invested more than pound million to help re-invigorate the role of public libraries, providing funds to support local and national activity.ldquoI encourage local communities throughout Scotland to continue to use and benefit from the wide range of services that our local libraries provide.Pamela Tulloch, chief executive of SLIC, said a national libraries strategy had provided a framework for the ldquotransformation of services in the st century.She said: ldquoIn some areas, this has led to some venue closures to make way for a more relevant and flexible model of delivery.ldquoHowever, local government has continued to invest in the estate, demonstrated by the signicant capital spend.ldquoPublic libraries have faced a challenging time in recent years amidst public spending cuts.ldquoHowever, they have shown tremendous resilience and are adapting services to meet the needs of modern users.The latest figures show there is still a strong commitment to public libraries from the public with premise and virtual visits increasing from .m to over m since .Earlier this month, there was concern that the service was under threat with figures showing  libraries have been closed in the past two years.Figures form SLIC showed said  libraries closed last year, up from  the previous year.Closures have remained in single figures for most of the previous decade.There are fears libraries are seen as a ldquosoft touch for councils looking to make cuts in a climate of falling budgets.The former Scots-based Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson hit out at the scale of the closures, saying libraries served a vital role as community centres.A spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland said: ldquoWe recognise that recent years have seen huge local authority budgetary cuts.ldquoThe fact the number of people using libraries has increased in the same period highlights their popularity, the changing ways people access services and the vital contribution they make to community cohesion, social and economic wellbeing, digital skills, literacy and more.ldquoWe urge local authorities to think very carefully and consult residents fully before closing any libraries."},{"url":null,"title":"swinney-vote-to-halt-p1-tests-a-disgrace","story":"The Education Secretary is due to update MSPs later this year on the governmentrsquos response to Holyrood voting to suspend standardised national assessments for four and five year olds.The opposition parties outvoted the SNP last month over the half-hour literacy and maths tests, which are opposed by teachers and have led to claims of children left in tears.Schools are continuing to conduct the assessments, although three councils have unilaterally opted out.Mr Swinney has been urged to ldquorespect the will of parliament and suspend all P testspending a re-examination of the policy.However at a fringe at the SNP conference in Glasgow, he gave a strong hint that he did not intend to follow the non-binding vote, saying it was never about education.He also repeated his support for assessments to help learn what children need in school.He said: ldquoI want to make absolutely certain that every child in our education system is getting what they need to help them.

I detest those three malignant words ndash they are a great wall standing in the way of men confronting the problems of their sex. Those words prevent our betterment as men. When I hear the words lsquonot all menrsquo, I see an apologist for misogyny ndash an enabler who is part of the problem.Readers will be aware that over the last few days, Irsquove written about the experiences of my youngest daughter, Caitie, after a man tried to lure her into woods, exposed himself, and masturbated in front of her. Caitie, a university student, ran to her place of work, Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow, and rang the police. The offender had mental health problems and police would not interview him. As a result, he was never charged or prosecuted. To compound her anguish, the man stalked her at work. Experts in male offending fear my daughter remains at risk as long as he remains at large.My concerns over what is wrong with men do not simply stem from the crime committed against my child ndash though that has certainly crystallised the thinking of decades. The words lsquotoxic masculinityrsquo didnrsquot exist when I was a young man, but they express the curdled disgust Irsquove felt throughout most of my le at the behaviour of many of my sex.Since my teens, Irsquove lost count of the number of close women friends who have told me of the sexual harassment and abuse they have endured ndash with offences ranging all the way up to rape.I should not have been astonished, then, that over the last few days, after I wrote about my daughter, that I was met with a tidal wave of pain from women contacting me to tell of victimisation and abuse. But I was astonished. Hundreds of women contacted me through social media or by email to offer their love and support to my daughter, many said they empathised with her because the same, or worse, had happened to them. These were women Irsquove never met, that I do not know ndash they had no reason to share their suffering with me, a man. But these women were outraged on behalf of my daughter, and they wanted to share their anger. Their words and kindness often moved me to tears.Many told me they or their daughters had gone through exactly the same set of circumstances as Caitie. One woman said Caitiersquos story lsquoresonates personally due to my own daughterrsquos appalling experiencersquo. Another told how she was the victim of a stalker and lsquolived in hell for three years while the police did nothingrsquo.Read more: My daughters hellAnother woman described how a man exposed himself to her aunt and a friend and were laughed at by police when they reported it. Some women spoke of being victims of sexual offences but keeping silent because they believed the police would not help them, due to the experiences of friends and family. A woman even said that a police officer asked her for oral sex and then told her he knew where she lived. A psychologist said they had heard many stories of police failings by victims of sex crimes.One terrible story was of a disabled woman being sexually assaulted and the case quickly closed. In one of the most distressing stories, a woman reported being sexually assaulted by a man in a town street while police watched, and did nothing. One mother told of police humiliating her teenage daughter during an interview after she was the victim of an offence ndash in the end there was no prosecution either.The dreadful truth, though, is that none of this is new. It wasnrsquot new last year when a predatory president walked into the Oval Office with a string of sexual assault claims hanging around his neck, and it wasnrsquot new millennia ago either.

A clear message needs to be sent to men thatyou offend against a woman, simply because shersquos a woman, then the justice system will come down on you like a ton of bricks. Only yesterday this paperrsquos front page revealed that one in three schoolgirls has been sexually harassed by a man in public ndash with children as young as eight being victims.

The reason, Sir Howard is reported as saying, is that as the bank has staged ldquoone of the biggest corporate turnarounds in history it is now ldquofully focused on building a much better bank for our customers.It is not the first time that the bank has tried to distance itself from the RBS moniker, with a  decision seeing it drop the name from  branches across the UK in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland north of the Border and NatWest south of it. The plan now is to stop using it in a corporate context, which essentially means when trying to find institutions interested in buying its shares.The thing is, RBS has come a long way in the past  years. Having grown into an unwieldy international behemoth under the leadership of former boss Fred ldquothe shred Goodwin, the business has slimmed down into something far more recognisable as a mainstream British bank. It has also taken some steps to right past wrongdoings by paying compensation to certain shareholders and customers who were affected by its actions.Signs that RBS was finally starting to emerge from the wilderness came earlier this year when the institution made a profit then paid a idend for the first time in a decade. When, in August, it agreed to pay pound. billion to settle a US Department of Justice investigation that had hung over it for the same period of time, RBS was able finally to draw a faint line under its past misdemeanours.To rebrand now, just when City analysts think the bank is starting to look investable again, would seem almost as wacky as taking part in the poundbn take-over of a Dutch bank on which limited due diligence had been done. Indeed, while RBS may have been well advised to reinvent itself in the immediate aftermath of its bailout, it would seem there is no pressing need for it to do so now.Sure RBS continues to be dogged by problems, as evidenced by it being labelled Britainrsquos worst bank for customer service by the Competition and Markets Authority and the worst for handling PPI claims by consumer group Which .Its decision to plough ahead with branch closures in the face of a signicant public backlash has also done its reputation no favours, with the fact that other banks are doing exactly the same thing having no truck with a public that feels it has a vested interest in RBS thanks to the Treasury retaining a signicant shareholding in it.But these issues are small fry compared to what RBS has been through over the past  years, and as it is facing them from a position of relative corporate strength they are hardly worth reinventing itself for now. As brand expert Marc Cloosterman wrote in US publication Branding Strategy Insider in June, a business with a bad reputation may use a rebranding exercise to ldquoameliorate or dispel negative associationsthat reputation is ldquohaving a serious impact on its operating results.But with RBS seemingly well on the road to recovery the pressure on its brand has eased and, with investors liking nothing better than a company that is clearly on the up, surely it is only a matter of time before its brand is rehabilitated too.That it is given the chance to do this is important not just for the bank but for Scotland as well. Like brand identity, national identity is a tricky concept to pin down, but it essentially revolves around how disparate groups of people use symbols and ideas to bind themselves to one another in an image of togetherness.Being measured in our financial dealings has long been seen as an essential part of what it is to be Scottish, with the way we behave as iniduals shaping our institutions and informing the way we are viewed by others. It is fair to say that RBS has been a huge embarrassment to Scotland, and rightly so, but that is because the country helped shape the bankrsquos reputation for canniness in the first place.Planning to get rid of the RBS brand may be more about a bank that is now run from London wanting to distance itself from the nation whose image it helped to tarnish. But to obliterate a name we were once so proud of just when the institution behind it is starting to emerge as something better would be to do a disservice to all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie saved from a96 dual plans","story":"The option to create a dual carriageway through the Bennachie area has been scrapped by the Scottish Government.It has been removed following initial design and assessment work, and also feedback from the public.Initial options removed include the existing A Inverurie Bypass and the offline southern route between east of Huntly and Blackburn, which passes through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area.Local communities and road users in the Inverurie area have the chance to see and comment on the options being taken forward for further design as the Scottish government looks to identy a preferred route option next year.Public exhibitions will be held at Inverurie Town Hall todayand tomorrow , and residents in Huntly will get to have their say on Wednesdayat Stewarts Hall.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online.

Labour accused Swinney of arrogance,with many teachers branding them a waste of time which can leave youngsters stressed.But the Education Secretary was in defiant mood as he addressed a fringe meeting organised by teaching union the EIS at the SNP’s Autumn conference in Glasgow today, insisting that the tests are needed to spot potential problems with youngsters’ development “We assess children and young people constantly in their lives to make sure their needs are being met,” Mr Swinney said.“If we didn’t I don’t think we’d be serving our children and young people very well at all. At  months, health visitors around the country do a vocabulary check on every child in the country to work outthey have a sufficient command of vocabulary.“If they’ve not it’s the first sign that that child may be developing a communication deficit. If a child develops a communication deficit, I think we can predict pretty reliably - based on a lot of scientic evidence and data - that child will face acute challenges in their le and they may, and probably likely,go on to pretty negative outcomes in their education.”The Education secretary said they he and his we ensured his own son to got this assessment to check his development was “going in the right direction.”Read more: John Swinney hails the Scottish Government’s “world-leading examples of progressive policies”“I apply the same rationale to Primary One assessments because I don’t wantit to be on my watch that the need and interests of young people are not being adequately identied - not because I want to paper the walls of this room with a league table, I’ve no interest in that whatsoever. But I want to make absolutely certain that every child in our education system is getting what they need in helping them progress.“That’s why I believe in Primary One Standardised assessments. And I think the debate Parliament had on this a few weeks ago was a disgrace. It wasn’t about the education of children it was about politics.”The SNP Government is not bound by the Holyrood vote to scrap the tests, but would face accusations of ignoring the “will of Parliament”it disregards the vote. This could prove awkward when Nationalists call for the “will of Parliament” to be respected when calling for another independence referendum which Holyrood has voted for.Labour education spokesman Iain Gray branded Mr Swinney “arrogant.”He said: “John Swinney continues to dig himself deeper into the hole he is in on Primary One standardised tests.“The reality is teachers believe these tests to be a waste of time and parents simply don’t trust them.“That is why the Scottish Parliament has voted to scrap these tests for  and  year olds. The SNP government should recognise that vote, respect the will of the Parliament and bin the tests.“Parliament listened to teachers and parents, and now John Swinney should listen to parliament.To fail to do so is wilful, disgraceful arrogance.”Read more: Joyce McMillan: SNP faces huge decisions over Brexit and Scottish independence©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4811807.1539025214!/image/image.jpg","title":"jonny hughes vertical forests and urban rivers can transform city life","story":"Scotland should take inspiration from places like Milan, where two residential tower blocks contain  trees and , shrubs, and Seoul, where a traffic-choked motorway was removed and a river corridor was restored, writes Jonny Hughes.Achieving truly sustainable cities is one of the great global challenges of the st century.

For these design solutions to be successful, a fundamental rethink about how we perceive cities is required. This means seeing them as ecosystems in their own right rather than separate and distinct from the geology, soils, water and natural habitats they are built upon. Such natural features are often still evident even in the most intensely urbanised areas – Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh and Glasgow’s Cuningar Loop are two examples close to home. In a new publication, the Scottish Wildle Trust has proposed a new design approach called ‘ecological urbanism’, which seeks to enhance cities’ underlying natural foundations to help create great places where people and nature can co-exist to mutual benefit. A compelling body of evidence has emerged that has revealed the many benefits to be gained from conserving and enhancing nature in cities. These include improved physical health and well-being, reduced flood risk, cleaner air and water, enhanced inward economic investment and even longer le expectancy. Ecological urbanism seeks to fully realise these benefits by blending green areas – parks, gardens, rivers, street trees and green roofs and walls – with grey urban infrastructure. But ecological urbanism is not simply about more greenspaces. It is about the densication of built-up areas to reduce sub-urban sprawl and the artful integration of green infrastructure in, on and around buildings and streets.: Jonny Hughes: How peat bogs could help save us from climate changeIn Scotland, we could draw inspiration from innovative urban greening projects around the world. Seoul removed a traffic-choked elevated motorway from the city centre and restored a .-mile river corridor that now attracts over , visitors daily and has catalysed economic development. Milan has built a vertical forest in the heart of the city in the form of two residential towers with an incredible  trees and , shrubs. It would be great to see such flagship projects in Scotland but what could be even more transformational isevery city dweller here took one simple step to re-wild their neighbourhood. Thousands of small actions from scattering wildflower seeds to growing vegetables in window boxes could, when taken together, have even greater benefits for people and nature than Milan’s famous Bosco Verticale.Jonny Hughes is Scottish Wildle Trust’s chief executive.

For months, they#ve kept up the pretence that they were wary of a second referendum on the EU, worried that it might damage the case for the vote they really want # on independence.They were never going to be able to keep that one up forever under irresistible pressure from inside and outside the party. But using the cute line that the SNP “won’t stand in the way” of a so-called People’s Vote kept up the suspense.It also allowed Sturgeon, who has nothing new to say about the timing of indyref, to show her hand on a second EU vote instead: SNP MPs will vote for it. Well, there was only one other option.The other interesting language from the First Minister’s interviews ahead of her big speech today is around a ‘blind Brexit’ – the possibility of the UK and EU agreeing little more than Brexit orce terms, and leaving the details of what post-Brexit trade will look like to thrash out later.: Theresa May: Good Brexit deal means end to austerityIf that’s what emerges from negotiations, then it might not be until the end of the transition period in  that the true shape of Brexit emerges. There is even talk of the UK staying within the EU customs regime until the next general election in , to allow time for the thorny issue of the Irish border to be resolved.That could help give Sturgeon the justication to argue that another vote on independence must wait further – perhaps until after the  Holyrood election, when the SNP could use the issue to try boost its mandate. The thinking goes that the naturally cautious First Minister, already burned by a failed push for indyref last year, will wait as long as she can before playing her cards.For someone not known as a gambler, keeping everyone guessing that long would be an audacious bluff.: Nicola Sturgeon: Brexit makes Scottish independence ‘inevitable’©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4811802.1539024616!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis how potholes helped cause brexit","story":"The disaffection that fuelled Brexit was strongest in forgotten, decaying towns, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.It’s the smallest hills we choose to die on – and the smallest holes we want to be buried in, too.Nothing fills a newspaper’s postbag like potholes, as I’ve been told on more than one occasion by successive editors. Pile up a stack of local newspapers on any given day from across the country – indeed the world – and it will be peppered with as many stories about potholes as west Edinburgh’s Dundee Street is by the real thing.More ‘sophisticated’ media outlets may scoff, but potholes are a great leveller: they represent a universal experience of urban decay. Like many British cities, Edinburgh is a grossly unequal place, but there’s egalitarianism in the terrible state of its roads. Potholes really are an everymanproblem.They also sum up the failure of local government: councils bearing the brunt of austerity have neither the money to fix the potholes that are already there, nor do they have the powers to stop new ones from forming.The cost of fixing Scotland’s roads is thought to exceed £ billion across the UK, it could be as much as £ billion. Meanwhile, local authorities can do little to stop utilities firms from ravaging freshly laid road surfaces.: Video: What a hard Brexit could mean for ScotlandPotholes are far from the only symbols of urban neglect. In so many other ways, local government has been powerless to protect the fabric of urban le: to stop big shopping developments draining the high street to shake down developers for the cost of essential infrastructure to support new housing to maintain good transport links outside the big cities to stop employers leaving or attract good, new jobs to replace them.What have humdrum local government gripes got to do with Brexit  Research from the Carnegie UK Trust suggests quite a lot.A report published last month, Remaking British Towns after Brexit, highlights that neglected and impoverished urban areas – too small and too distant to benefit from the economic engines of cities – were where the highest concentration of Brexit votes could be found.While cities and rural areas draw the attention of policy makers, towns fall in between and are often forgotten. As one of the authors, Glasgow University professor of public policy Duncan McLennan, reflects: “These dficulties primarily arose because of UK failures in managing places rather than membership of the EU.”Calling for a much more targeted approach to how power and investment is distributed to local communities, Professor McLennan warns that “although it may be too soon to really know what the precise impact of Brexit on towns will be, it’s clear that there needs to be action now to ensure that present neglect ends ... whether Brexit is soft, hard or even cancelled.”Devolution has so far meant giving new powers and money to national parliaments, to London, and latterly to big, articial urban agglomerations. Could the constitutional shake-up of Brexit mean that is about to change : Theresa May: Good Brexit deal means end to austerityOn the day the Conservative Party conference got underway in Birmingham last week, Scotland on Sunday revealed that the UK Government was preparing to take control of hundreds of millions of pounds in EU Structural and Investment Funds, previously administered by Holyrood, which are now likely to flow in large part directly from Westminster to Scottish local authorities after Brexit.It’s a move that will require little change to the devolution settlement as set out in legislation, but could produce a huge sht in the power relationship between Edinburgh, London and local communities.South of the border, where there isn’t the possibility of an independence referendum to influence the politics of who gets what money, a cross-party group of ‘metro mayors’ is now asking for control of money from the new UK Shared Prosperity Fund that will replace EU development money. Which approach will actually serve the needs of the UK’s neglected towns We think of Brexit a dam breaking under the pressure of enormous, pent up demands: a rejection of mass immigration and a rebellion against globalisation, or a yearning for sovereignty and a more accountable politics.That may be true, but how much were those feelings incubated in crumbling urban settings stripped of their locus of control All politics is local, it’s been said. Those trying to stop Brexit and those trying to deliver on its promises would do well to remember that, and start by filling the potholes.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4811894.1539069790!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon snp promises hope during an unfolding calamity","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon will call for her SNP colleagues to offer Scotland #optimism and hope# in a drive for independence as she closes their party conference today.In her keynote address to the gathering in Glasgow, the First Minister will say that Scotland could be a “beacon for progressive values” once it is outside the UK.Describing the handing of the Brexit negotiations by Theresa Mayas an “unfolding calamity”, she will call for the SNP to put forward a message of hope over the “despair” offered by Westminster.Read more: Scottish independence vote ‘can happen without Westminster approval’Ms Sturgeon will also announce an extension of fair work rules across the public sector, with the goal of increasing the number of Living Wage employers and reducing the gender pay gap.Read more: Poll: Unionists would accept Scottish independence to get Brexit“The Westminster Government stumbles from day to day and disaster to disaster.

Donate now gtgtAt the SNP conference in Glasgow yesterday, Mr Russell told a fringe meeting that an alternative route to giving Scots a say on independence without the agreement of the Prime Minister must now be explored.He said: “If the unionist parties say you can’t have a referendum, which is what the debate has been in the past few weeks, then there has to be a discussion about what happens next. That is simply anti-democratic.”: Angus MacNeil: Westminster approval not needed for Scottish independence voteMr Russell added: “There has to be a healthy discussion about the ways in which – not that there’s any sleight of hand or anything like it – but the democratic way in which Scotland could say it wishes to make a choice and that’s a legitimate discussion to have.“The SNP’s position is clear. We think that should be by means of a referendum.”Mr Russell insisted a second vote on leaving the UK would be staged, despite the current constitutional set-up.: This Danish businessman is now the largest landowner in Scotland“Devolution is a highly unsatisfactory set of circumstances, particularly a section  order, which is required in order to hold a referendum which requires agreement from both Houses of Parliament,” he said. “That’s a very dficult situation to get, but nothing is insuperable. I’m absolutely confident that we will be able to give the people of Scotland a choice at some future date. But let’s not limit ourselves by trying to create barriers in our minds to that happening because we’re going to do it.”Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil also told delegates “another way” must be found to stage a referendumthe necessary section  from Westminster, which has power over the constitution, was withheld. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to stage a second independence referendum regardless of any Brexit deal reached between Westminster and Brussels.In her keynote speech to conference today, Ms Sturgeon is expected to tell supporters that independence offers “optimism and hope” against the “despair” of Brexit.She had been due to set out her plans at this autumn conference, but this now seems unlikely because the final terms of Brexit remain unclear and there are growing concerns of a “no-deal” departure, which would prove damaging for Scotland’s economy.She will tell delegates: “The Westminster Government stumbles from day to day and disaster to disaster. It’s hard to watch that unfolding calamity and feel anything other than despair. So it is up to us – now more than ever – to offer optimism and hope.“Just think how much more hope will be possible when we take Scotland’s future into Scotland’s hands and become an independent country.“An independent Scotland, just as Scotland is now, will be a beacon for progressive values – equality, opportunity, ersity and fairness. Indeed those values feel more important today than ever before in my letime.”Ms Sturgeon is to set out her plans for a second referendum when the outcome of the Brexit negotiations becomes clear. Askeda fresh independence vote could happen during this parliamentary term, she told STV: “By definition, because I haven’t taken the decision, anything, including that, is still possible.”The First Minister also rejected suggestions from the party’s Home Affairs spokeswoman at Westminster, Joanna Cherry, that independence could be declared through a general election victory for the SNP in Scotland.Mr MacNeil told delegates the party should forge ahead with a referendum evenwithout Westminster’s approval, after weekend polls showed support for independence could be as high as  per cent under a hard Brexit.He said: “That is without even campaigning. Another  per cent was added the last time we campaigned. This time when the SNP gets going, there will be a lot more gained. If we can’t make this under a section  order, then we have to make it another way. We cannot dither at this point. We cannot be like the Jacobites in Derby who let the opportunity pass as they did in  and .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us.

What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p1-crop.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1061971.jpg--.jpg?1538469852000\n","title":"hot air balloon makes history by touching slemish summit","story":"The Little Ollie Balloon Team has created a piece of history by being one of the only hot air balloons to make a connection with the top of a mountain, when they recently touched the highest point of Slemish.It is hard for a balloon to land on top of a small space as often balloons do not come to a total stop, they drag a little, therefore the team were able to make a brief connection and landed further down the mountain.The Little Ollie Balloon Team have been in business for  years and are run by Henry Law and pilot Richard Pearse.Flying for  years, Richard is fully qualied with a private pilots licence for balloons and airships.He knows how to accurately read wind and weather patters and enjoys the tranquility of being in the air, so being associated with a little bit of ballooning history has definitely been a highlight for him.Speaking to the , Richard said: Being able to touch the top of Slemish was brilliant.As the top of Slemish is too small to land on, we made brief contact and then moved on to a nearby field.“When we first took off, I wasnt sure that we would be able to land, but the wind was just right as we approached it, so I thought why not give it a try! When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief. Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes. There will even be a live male wax at pm!The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      UFU welcomes speed limit at local schools Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8661702.1539074186!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Action Mental Health#s eating disorder service within the Southern Health and Social Care Trustarea has been relaunched, introducing a vital and effective new model of support for people experiencing eating disorders and their families  carers in partnership with the SHSCT.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-10.07.27.png","title":"ridiculous rules stop family clearing grave","story":"A WEST Belfast man has hit out at “ridiculous health and safety rules” which have left Belfast City Council staff unable to remove a large tree that fell on his parents’ grave during storm Ali over two weeks ago.Riverdale man Gerry Osborne says he was shocked when his son rang him to tell him that the tree had fallen down on top of his beloved parents’ headstone in the City Cemetery.Speaking to the Andersonstown News at the graveside, Gerry said: “We can see my parents’ grave from the Falls Road and it’s a great comfortyou’re driving or walking past just to be able to see it.“I always bless myself and say a prayer for them. My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this.

in the budget to reduce the cost of living and reduce the cost of accessing important social services.”Mr Donohoe added: “This budget will benefit families by looking to make childcare more affordable, by looking to ensure the cost of really important medical services gets a little bit cheaper than it is at the moment and then by targeting tax changes to ensure thatyou’re on a very normal or very average wage, you’re not already paying the highest rate of income tax in our country.”The Irish Hotels Federationexpressed “deep concern” at reports that the tourism VAT rate is to be increased as part of Budget .Michael Lennon, President of the IHF said the mooted increase to .% would be “disastrous” for Ireland’s competitiveness as a tourism destination and represented a “failure” to recognise its economic potential and recovery, particularly among regional and rural tourism businesses.“The proposed increase would be reckless and would result in Ireland having a higher VAT rate on tourism than  countries in Europe with which we compete.“We are already a very high cost economy by international standards so it is alarming that the Government is now looking at imposing additional taxes on tourists and making our country less attractive as a destination.“Any increase would hit tourism throughout the country with businesses outside of DublinIreland’s largest

for the Environmental Pillar, said: “A carbon tax is a lever that we can pull immediately to support the State’s long-term targets such as the retrofitting of , homes by  and getting , electric cars

We’ve made that very clear.

Working hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop #Brexit pic JLWoQNYzG— Michel BarnierOctober , Mrs May told the regular weekly Cabinet meeting at  Downing Street that talks to finalise a withdrawal deal were continuing “on an intensive basis”.Her official spokesman said: “The PM said that our efforts will focus on seeking agreement on the few remaining issues, including the Northern Ireland backstop.“She made clear that we can’t agreed to a withdrawal agreement without a precise future framework which delivers the future trade and security partnership which the Government wants.“The PM said the UK would continue working hard in the talks on Brexit and the message from EU leaders is that they want to reach a deal.”Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was warned that she faces a Commons rebellion of at least  Conservative MPsshe s from Brussels with a deal based on her Chequers plan, leaving the UK “half in, half out” of the EU.A revolt on this scale would leave Mrs May relying on the votes of dozens of Labour MPs to secure parliamentary approval for any deal.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said that as many as  Tories are ready to oppose the plan agreed by Cabinet at Mrs May’s country residence in July, and that at least half of them would stand firm against an “extremely hard” whipping operation.If you listened to the Brexit segment on @BBCrtoday and wanted more context, these  short videos may be helpful:https:t.co pAmALYpZPGet the transcripts here:https:t.co KgPRlWviuQ#PlanAPlus— Steve Baker MPOctober , Mr Baker, a senior figure in the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “The whips would be doing incredibly wellthey were to halve the numbers.“My estimate is that there are at least  colleagues who are not going to accept a half-in, half-out Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the customs union, come what may.”Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper warned that relying on Labour voters would not work.Mr Harper, who was a Home Office minister during Mrs May’s tenure in the department, told the Daily : “We are going to have to carry this deal on our own benches. If you’re the Prime Minister, you do have to listen to colleagues.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who campaigned for Leave in the referendum, said Mrs May “has my support and I am not in any way expecting that situation to change”.But she suggested that the Prime Minister may have to amend her Chequers plan to get a final deal, saying that “we don’t know where this is going to end up”.Answering questions following a speech in London, Ms Mordaunt said: “The Prime Minister can count on my support.“But what I would say is that we don’t know where this is going to end up. We are at a critical moment now. The ball is firmly back in the EU’s court. We are waiting for them to respond.”"},{"url":null,"title":"people have taken to social media to document octobers ladybird infestations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Inside, councillors decided against calling in the police as there were children involved. They closed the windows in the chamber and tried to speak over the noise from outside.DOWNPATRICK mdash Down councillors are staying firmly on course with their plans to open a major dumping site in a picturesque area less than half a mile from the Quoile River, outside Downpatrick.Despite facing a mounting wall of protest from planners and conservationists, councillors decided this week to stick to their guns and push ahead with the scheme.The site eats up almost  acres of land, about half a mile from Quoile Yacht Club, and the council scheme entails a six-feet excavation of the entire area.Pollution controllers at Stormont have already come out against the scheme because they fear it could pollute the nearby Quoile River and local planners have received many complaints from conservationists.Even councillors themselves are split and some launched into fierce opposition of the scheme at this weekrsquos council meeting.Downpatrick councillor George Flinn, whose home is less than a five-minute walk from the river, was the sternest critic and he pulled no punches in an open attack on the plan.ldquoI am appalled that a council which prides itself on being forward-looking should be asked to agree to the vandalising of one of the areas of outstanding natural beauty within its district.KILLYLEAGH mdash Residents of Killyleagh and Shrigley have called for a full debate on the future of the harbour site and possible marina plans.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

File photo dated    of the EU and Union flags. Photo credit: Stefan Rousseau PA Wire The UK Government has promised to set out further proposals on the “backstop” arrangement aimed at avoiding a hard border with Ireland, with speculation that it could involve regulatory checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland.Mrs Foster, whose  MPs play a critical role in propping up Theresa May’s administration in Westminster, set out her staunch opposition to any border effectively being drawn in the Irish Sea.The EU’s proposed backstop would see Northern Ireland effectively remain in the customs union and single market while the rest of the UK shts away from Brussels’ rules, something the Prime Minister has already said would be unacceptable.Mrs Foster said: “As we leave the EU, we should do so as one nation.   Arlene Foster “The United Kingdom single market must be protected with no new borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain being created. From day one this has been the DUP’s only red line.“This red line is recognising that Great Britain is Northern Ireland’s biggest market.“Over % of all goods leaving Belfast port are destined for Great Britain. To create a barrier to that trade would be catastrophic.”Meanwhile a former Brexit minister called for an “advanced free trade agreement” with the EU, with “practical arrangements” on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Steve Baker also claimed senior figures in Government are seeking the softest form of Brexit, potentially to allow the UK to rejoin the European Union, a former minister claimed.Mr Baker, who was a minister in the Brexit department until July, suggested “powerful forces” in Government were seeking to keep the UK in arrangements similar to the single market and customs union.Meanwhile Mark Harper, a former chief whip, urged Mrs May to scrap her Chequers plan because it will never get through the Commons.Legacy consultation: New NIO justice measures ‘could be undermined by  information’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said Mrs May should “unite the party around a comprehensive free trade deal that she can actually get through Parliament”.The normally loyal MP told the Daily : “We are going to have to carry this deal on our own benches. If you’re the Prime Minister you do have to listen to colleagues.”Downing Street has played down expectations of agreement on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU at a crunch summit next week, warning that “big issues” remain to be resolved.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said further concessions were needed from the EU side, and warned that no withdrawal agreement could be sealed without a “precise” declaration about the post-Brexit relationship.The comments appeared to pour cold water on upbeat assessments on the prospects of a deal made by senior EU figures over recent days.The October  summit in Brussels had initially been pencilled in as the deadline for agreement on withdrawal.But Downing Street would say only that the UK was working for a deal “this autumn”, fuelling speculation that a special summit in November will be needed to hammer out agreement on issues including the status of the Irish border.Technical talks are continuing at official level in Brussels this week, but no visit by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has been announced, and Downing Street would say only that new proposals on the border issue would be released “in due course”.try catch     .               ..

Our message is still Good News and it still changes lives.”Rev Sinclair first became interested in the Christian faith as a pupil at Glasgow Academy when, to escape getting into trouble after a prefect saw him taking the wrong staircase, he dodged into a room where a Scripture Union camp video was showing.While a university student, he took a holiday job as a film extra playing a Roman soldier in the  comedy Monty Python and the Holy Grail.Earlier this year, the Presbyterian Church’s General Assembly voted to loosen ties with the Church of Scotland due to its more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.The decision means the head of the Church of Scotland will no longer be invited to the annual meeting of the General Assembly in Belfast.Reports link gun victim to Gerry Adams’ car attack Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon.

I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Working hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop #Brexit pic JLWoQNYzGmdash Michel BarnierOctober , Mrs May told the regular weekly Cabinet meeting at  Downing Street that talks to finalise a withdrawal deal were continuing ldquoon an intensive basis.Her official spokesman said: ldquoThe PM said that our efforts will focus on seeking agreement on the few remaining issues, including the Northern Ireland backstop.ldquoShe made clear that we canrsquot agreed to a withdrawal agreement without a precise future framework which delivers the future trade and security partnership which the Government wants.ldquoThe PM said the UK would continue working hard in the talks on Brexit and the message from EU leaders is that they want to reach a deal.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was warned that she faces a Commons rebellion of at least  Conservative MPsshe s from Brussels with a deal based on her Chequers plan, leaving the UK ldquohalf in, half out of the EU.A revolt on this scale would leave Mrs May relying on the votes of dozens of Labour MPs to secure parliamentary approval for any deal.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said that as many as  Tories are ready to oppose the plan agreed by Cabinet at Mrs Mayrsquos country residence in July, and that at least half of them would stand firm against an ldquoextremely hard whipping operation.If you listened to the Brexit segment on @BBCrtoday and wanted more context, these  short videos may be helpful:https:t.co pAmALYpZPGet the transcripts here:https:t.co KgPRlWviuQ#PlanAPlusmdash Steve Baker MPOctober , Mr Baker, a senior figure in the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group, told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe whips would be doing incredibly wellthey were to halve the numbers.ldquoMy estimate is that there are at least  colleagues who are not going to accept a half-in, half-out Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the customs union, come what may.Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper warned that relying on Labour voters would not work.Mr Harper, who was a Home Office minister during Mrs Mayrsquos tenure in the department, told the Daily : ldquoWe are going to have to carry this deal on our own benches. If yoursquore the Prime Minister, you do have to listen to colleagues.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who campaigned for Leave in the referendum, said Mrs May ldquohas my support and I am not in any way expecting that situation to change.But she suggested that the Prime Minister may have to amend her Chequers plan to get a final deal, saying that ldquowe donrsquot know where this is going to end up.Answering questions following a speech in London, Ms Mordaunt said:ldquoThe Prime Minister can count on my support.ldquoBut what I would say is that we donrsquot know where this is going to end up.

Working hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop #Brexit pic JLWoQNYzGmdash Michel BarnierOctober , Mrs May told the regular weekly Cabinet meeting at  Downing Street that talks to finalise a withdrawal deal were continuing ldquoon an intensive basis.Her official spokesman said: ldquoThe PM said that our efforts will focus on seeking agreement on the few remaining issues, including the Northern Ireland backstop.ldquoShe made clear that we canrsquot agreed to a withdrawal agreement without a precise future framework which delivers the future trade and security partnership which the Government wants.ldquoThe PM said the UK would continue working hard in the talks on Brexit and the message from EU leaders is that they want to reach a deal.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister was warned that she faces a Commons rebellion of at least  Conservative MPsshe s from Brussels with a deal based on her Chequers plan, leaving the UK ldquohalf in, half out of the EU.A revolt on this scale would leave Mrs May relying on the votes of dozens of Labour MPs to secure parliamentary approval for any deal.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said that as many as  Tories are ready to oppose the plan agreed by Cabinet at Mrs Mayrsquos country residence in July, and that at least half of them would stand firm against an ldquoextremely hard whipping operation.If you listened to the Brexit segment on @BBCrtoday and wanted more context, these  short videos may be helpful:https:t.co pAmALYpZPGet the transcripts here:https:t.co KgPRlWviuQ#PlanAPlusmdash Steve Baker MPOctober , Mr Baker, a senior figure in the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group, told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe whips would be doing incredibly wellthey were to halve the numbers.ldquoMy estimate is that there are at least  colleagues who are not going to accept a half-in, half-out Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the customs union, come what may.Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper warned that relying on Labour voters would not work.Mr Harper, who was a Home Office minister during Mrs Mayrsquos tenure in the department, told the Daily : ldquoWe are going to have to carry this deal on our own benches. If yoursquore the Prime Minister, you do have to listen to colleagues.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who campaigned for Leave in the referendum, said Mrs May ldquohas my support and I am not in any way expecting that situation to change.But she suggested that the Prime Minister may have to amend her Chequers plan to get a final deal, saying that ldquowe donrsquot know where this is going to end up.Answering questions following a speech in London, Ms Mordaunt said:ldquoThe Prime Minister can count on my support.ldquoBut what I would say is that we donrsquot know where this is going to end up. We are at a critical moment now. The ball is firmly back in the EUrsquos court.

This represents an investment of £, and is part of an overall programme by NI Water across the province to improve the existing sewerage network.This work follows investigation works previously undertaken in these areas, which identied defects in the existing sewerage network, which require urgent repair.These sewer improvement works will include the installation of “liners” in existing pipelines, the “open-dig” repair of short sections of sewer at isolated locations, as well as the laying of some short sections of new replacement pipelines.An NI Water spokesperson said: “Work will commence in early October  and we anticipate will take two months to complete. The work in this phase will primarily be undertaken using underground ‘no-dig’ techniques with a small amount of ‘open-dig’ work. NI Water strive to undertake as much of this work as possible using “no-dig” techniques, which minimise disruption to people’s daily lives, as well as providing environmental benefits such as reduction in construction waste and carbon footprint.”The works will be carried out at ious locations throughout Portadown, Lurgan and Magheralin during this time, and notications will be issued to residents and businesses in the affected areas as the work progresses.It will be necessary at some locations to have lane road closures in place in order for the works to be carried out safely. This is to protect the safety of road users, the public and construction workers.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.
